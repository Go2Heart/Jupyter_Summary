China leads green development with another practical step,"00:35

After pledging to strive to peak carbon dioxide emissions before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060, China has taken another remarkable and practical step in pursuing green development. China will step up support for other developing countries in promoting green and low-carbon energy and will not build new coal-fired power projects abroad, announced President Xi Jinping at the general debate of the 76th session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) via video on Tuesday. This is not surprising but of great significance, as China has previously cooperated with several countries along the routes of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) towards ""greening"" the initiative.

Global development initiative Phasing out coal investments would be promising to reduce carbon emissions, which pose a threat to the United Nations' (UN) Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development, especially Goal 13 on climate action.



Besides decreasing coal-fired power projects, China has pledged an additional $3 billion of international assistance in the next three years to support developing countries in responding to COVID-19 and promoting economic and social recovery.



""Development holds the key to people's well-being,"" Xi said, adding that countries need to work together to steer global development towards a new stage of balanced, coordinated and inclusive growth.

Beijing has highlighted its willingness to work with the international community, including the United States, to jointly advance global environmental governance.



For instance, through joint partnership, China has established the Belt and Road Initiative International Green Development Coalition, which serves as a platform for BRI cooperation on green development. Under the platform, China has provided more than 2,000 training opportunities for environmental protection officials, experts and technicians from over 120 participating countries.



Adhering to green development is engraved in the Chinese government through the Constitution and the master blueprint of national development as an ecological civilization to be observed in all socioeconomic developments and political agendas.

Beating COVID-19 remains a major task



Undoubtedly, though many countries are busy trying to rebuild their economies amid the pandemic, COVID-19 is still raging in the world, with the number of new cases rising every day globally.



Under such circumstances, President Xi called for putting people and their lives first, taking a science-based approach to origins tracing, enhancing the coordinated global COVID-19 response and minimizing the risk of cross-border virus transmission.



Noting that vaccination is a powerful weapon against COVID-19, he stressed the pressing priority is to ensure the fair and equitable distribution of vaccines globally.



China has promised to provide a total of two billion doses of the COVID-19 vaccine to the world by the end of this year and has donated 100 million doses of the vaccine to other developing countries in the course of this year in addition to $100 million to COVAX.

Practicing true multilateralism is critical



Whether it is improving global environmental governance or beating COVID-19, multilateralism is paramount, which is another key point of Xi's statement at the UNGA.



""The UN should hold high the banner of true multilateralism and serve as the central platform for countries to jointly safeguard universal security, share development achievements and chart the course for the future of the world,"" Xi said.



The Chinese president called on the UN to increase the representation and say of developing countries in international affairs and take the lead in advancing democracy and the rule of law in international relations.

China, a staunch supporter of multilateralism



President Xi also called for building a new type of international relations based on mutual respect, equity, justice and win-win cooperation, stressing that the practice of forming small circles or zero-sum games should be rejected. ""One country's success does not have to mean another country's failure, and the world is big enough to accommodate common development and progress of all countries,"" he said, adding that differences and problems among countries need to be handled through dialogue and cooperation on the basis of equality and mutual respect.

Trudeau wins third consecutive mandate in Canadian election,"Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has held onto his job after his Liberal Party won its third consecutive term to form a government in Monday's national election.

But Trudeau will lead a minority government as he did since the last federal vote in 2019, instead of a majority government he secured when he became Canada's 23rd prime minister in 2015.

On Monday night, the Liberals won 158 of the 338 federal ridings ¨C short of the 170 seats needed for a majority government.

Trudeau said he wanted a clear mandate to lead Canada through the COVID-19 pandemic when he called the national vote on August 15.

In the next two years, the Liberals will have to work with other progressive parties in the House of Commons to pass legislation.

The left-of-center New Democratic Party, which appeared to have added two seats to the 24 it won in 2019, was a cooperative partner with the Liberals in the last parliament.

The Bloc Quebecois, a nationalist party that promotes sovereignty in the French-speaking province of Quebec and which on Monday was poised to claim 31 seats, will remain resolute in stipulating that any collaboration with the governing Liberals must consider the interests of Quebecers.

With the Green Party maintaining its two House seats, Trudeau could have enough support from the three liberal-minded opposition parties to proceed with his Liberal government's agenda to lead Canada through to the end of the pandemic and tackle such issues as housing affordability, childcare and reviving an economy amid rising prices for goods and services.

""Millions of Canadians have chosen a progressive plan,"" said Trudeau at a post-midnight victory speech in Montreal early Tuesday morning.

Six years ago, the then prime minister-designate spoke of how the ""sunny ways"" of positive politics his Liberal Party embraced.

In 2021, with a less-than-ideal outcome for his Liberals at the polls, Trudeau promised Canadians ""brighter days ahead"" and concluded his televised address with the message: ""Let us seize the promise of a brand-new day.""

The House vote was 220-211 along party lines. All Democrats voted for it and all Republicans opposed it.

If Republicans stick by their refusal to support the measure in the Senate, Democrats will have to come up with a new strategy or quickly face the twin problems of a government in partial shutdown that is unable to pay its bills and the risk of a default for the first time in modern history.

Editor's note: CGTN's First Voice provides instant commentary on breaking stories. The daily column clarifies emerging issues and better defines the news agenda, offering a Chinese perspective on the latest global events.

The world is at a historical crossroads, facing unprecedented dangers from climate change, a global pandemic, and uneven development that leaves many without basic living necessities.

In the face of these threats, humanity has the choice of working together for the common good of all, or choosing to exploit this period of turbulence and transformation for selfish and narrow gains.

The three most crucial threats facing mankind at this moment are climate change, the pandemic, and a movement toward division and war over multilateralism and cooperation.

Some people are under the mistaken impression that protecting the environment must come at the cost of economic growth, but this is not true. Protecting the environment and pursuing development are not at odds, but can work together to bring a better life for everybody.

In recent years, China has demonstrated this again and again with domestic development projects that drive local growth by protecting local natural resources.

China is now demonstrating to the world how this principle can work.

In his speech to the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA), President Xi Jinping committed to stopping financial support to any new coal-fired power plants abroad, and redirecting China's support to green and low-carbon energy.

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres praised Xi's pledge, saying that accelerating the global phase out of coal is the single most important step to keep the 1.5-degree goal of the Paris Agreement within reach.

The development of green technology, an area in which China is a global leader, is key to reaching climate change goals, and also keeping a balance between man and nature.

Another threat facing humanity at this crossroads is the COVID-19 pandemic. People's lives must be given priority in the battle against the coronavirus.

Shockingly, some countries have still not learned this lesson.

Some countries, in a rush to put their economy first by sidetracking science, have ended up hurting their economies and people more if they had just implemented simple public health measures in the first place.

World leaders need to respect science, take a science-based approach, and follow the laws of science when fighting COVID-19. Nations must work together to enhance a coordinated global COVID-19 response and minimize the risk of cross-border virus transmission.

Vaccination is the most powerful weapon against COVID-19. President Xi has stressed on many occasions the need to make vaccines a global public good and ensure vaccine accessibility and affordability in developing countries. China is doing its part by aiming to provide 2 billion vaccine doses to the world by the end of this year. China is also donating $100 million to COVAX, and donating 100 million vaccine doses to other developing countries in the course of this year.

But as China tries to help fight COVID-19, others are taking advantage of this plague upon humanity to isolate and alienate their political rivals. China will continue to support and engage in global science-based virus origins tracing, and stands firmly opposed to scapegoating and silly political games that cost people's lives."
AUKUS gaining universal acceptance in Indo-Pacific simply delusional,"Take Malaysia and Indonesia for example. It took only days for the two Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) member states to jointly express concern over this pact being a potential trigger for an evolving arms race in the region, which might upset the smooth flow of trade and compromise economic prosperity, the bedrock of ASEAN stability. Note that both Jakarta and Kuala Lumpur acknowledge that this security pact is laced with anti-pacifism and is quintessentially a boisterous display of Western power countering a rising China. Strong bilateral relations with the United States or Australia do not preclude the fact that each state will not extend blanket acceptance of such security pacts as each country strives for a demilitarized and denuclearized zone. The presence of nuclear submarines goes against this principle and is simply unacceptable.

If the objective of the AUKUS security pact between the United Kingdom, Australia and the United States is to bifurcate the globe into ""pro-China"" and ""anti-China"" camps, then that strategy is doomed to fail. In a testament to the looming failure of this dangerous alliance, Southeast Asian states with foreign policy priorities of ""non-alignment"" have issued calls for de-escalation and denuclearization, which have been echoed since the pact came into force. Despite the dissemination of nuclear technologies, sharing of sensitive information and defense force partnerships, military engagements have encountered suspicion in the region. If the Morrison, Biden and Johnson administrations believe that the foreign policies of other countries would be fine-tuned to the whims and wishes of AUKUS, the Southeast Asia case demonstrates that they are mistaken.

There is also a growing understanding that events across the world, such as the aftermath of the 20-year U.S. war in Afghanistan, are products of flawed doctrines of intervention co-sponsored by Washington's allies. That is precisely why Biden administration officials such as Vice President Kamala Harris and her anti-China tirades during her South East Asia tour earlier were not reciprocated by any ASEAN member state. Note further that the additional nuclear dimension in the region will only reinforce the narrative that imperialist designs and great power rivalry are being pursued, which imperils the neighborhood due to further military buildups and the risk of miscalculations running high. This also explains why even one of the strongest allies of Australia, Singapore, has expressed concern over Canberra's entire plan of acquiring a nuclear-powered fleet. Can Singapore, or any other state for that matter, be blamed for denouncing the pact as disturbing? The answer is no.

Nuclear-powered submarines cannot be acquired without the future development of nuclear weapons programs, which have proven to be controversial internationally and historically. It also goes against the Non-Proliferation Treaty and the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, the latter of which became effective in early 2021 without Australia joining as a signatory. The central tenets of the treaty mandate that all member states will refrain from testing, acquiring, possessing or stockpiling nuclear weapons, yet the Morrison administration has stated that the treaty would go against Australia's security objectives and its alliance with the United States, a nuclear weapons state. Hence, concerns regarding brazen proliferation and a probable deterioration in the deterrence equation in the region are well-founded, logical and principled.

Assurances from AUKUS states regarding the security pact being free of anti-China sentiments will not be bought, given the respective foreign policy priorities of each member state in the Indo-Pacific. In 1995, ASEAN signed the Treaty of Southeast Asia Nuclear Weapon Free Zone, which aims to keep the region denuclearized. However, no nuclear weapons state has signed the treaty. Also, an understanding exists that powers such as the United States are more interested in military buildups and policies of encirclement and attrition than the treaty, which the regional states have historically banked upon.

To believe that AUKUS would gain universal acceptance in the Indo-Pacific would be simply delusional. From the outset, it is a nonstarter.

Editor's note: Andrew Korybko is a Moscow-based American political analyst. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

U.S. President Joe Biden addressed the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday about a broad range of issues. He deserves praise for committing his country to the international community's efforts to combat climate change and COVID-19.

These were the high marks of speech, but unfortunately, he sullied all of that by lying to everyone when he said that the U.S. doesn't want a new Cold War. The reality is that the U.S. is already in a new Cold War with China characterized by an intense hybrid warfare campaign against it.

Biden claims that the U.S. will cooperate with any country that shares America's supposedly peaceful intentions, but that isn't true when it comes to China. Not only has he aggressively sought to contain the country through a wide range of means stretching from the economic to the military and even informational, but the American leader has also meddled in China's internal affairs.

No clearer evidence of this exists than him exploiting that global podium to attack China for its counterterrorism and deradicalization measures in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.

According to him, these measures represent the ""oppression"" of a minority group. He also alluded to that twice earlier in his speech when he warned about emerging technologies being used to deepen repression, especially against minorities.

The U.S. has accused China of such deeds for several years, each time without a sliver of evidence of it using its world-class technological systems to oppress the Uygurs, which isn't true at all but nevertheless has become one of the leading mainstream media narratives for discrediting China.

It was also highly hypocritical of him to say that America doesn't want to divide the world into competing blocs, yet that's exactly what it's doing with the Quad or the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, and most recently, the new alliance between the U.S., Australia and the UK (AUKUS)."
Key quotes: Xi Jinping's vision of safeguarding world peace,"Tuesday marks the International Day of Peace, representing good wishes for world peace from people all around the globe.

Proposing the concept of ""building a community with a shared future for mankind,"" Chinese President Xi Jinping has on many occasions stressed that China is a staunch advocate and strong defender of world peace and the Chinese people will stay committed to the noble cause of peace and development of mankind.

The following are some highlights of his remarks in this regard."

The Chinese Mid-Autumn Festival, celebrated on September 21 this year, is an occasion for family reunions. It is a day on which many people believe dreams come true when the moon is at its fullest. On this day, let's take a look back at 2021, which has so far witnessed many of the Chinese dreams come true, including the fulfillment of the first centenary goal of building a moderately prosperous society in all respects and the successful completion of the Shenzhou-12 manned spaceflight mission.

Building a moderately prosperous society ""Through the continued efforts of the whole Party and the entire nation, we have realized the first centenary goal of building a moderately prosperous society in all respects,"" Chinese President Xi Jinping declared at a ceremony marking the centenary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) on July 1. With the announcement, China brought about a historic resolution to the problem of absolute poverty. The country is now marching toward the second centenary goal of building China into a great modern socialist country in all respects.

Within eight years, China successfully lifted the final 98.99 million impoverished people out of poverty, together with 832 impoverished counties and 128,000 villages. China spent a total of nearly 1.6 trillion yuan (about $246 billion) on eradicating poverty through a strategy of targeted poverty alleviation, striving to eradicate poverty through development. Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC) in 2012, Xi has presided over seven central poverty alleviation work symposiums, conducted over 50 research tours on poverty reduction and visited all of China's 14 contiguous impoverished areas. Millions of cadres were sent to the front line of poverty alleviation. Among them, over 1,800 workers lost lives for the country's great cause. In Xi's words, the eradication of absolute poverty has represented a miraculous achievement in China. The victory has been secured through the combined efforts of the whole Party and the nation.

Advancements in space exploration China's space dream is another highlight of the year 2021. The country declared a complete success of the Shenzhou-12 manned spaceflight mission after three Chinese astronauts landed safely on Earth on September 17, ending their three-month space travel. On April 29, China launched the Tianhe core module of the China Space Station. Just as Xi said during his conversation with the astronauts on June 23, ""the construction of the space station is a milestone in China's space industry, which will make pioneering contributions to the peaceful use of space by humanity.""

Adding: ""We need this time. If we get out of coal even earlier, then the problems will only increase.""

Lausitz is home to three active coal mines that dig for lignite, or so-called ""brown coal."" Lignite is one of the dirtiest fossil fuels and has long been in the firing line of climate campaigners.

At present, Germany relies on lignite coal production for 23 percent of electricity needs. Renewable sources, such as solar and wind, account for 33 percent.

While unlikely to be part of the next government, the Alternative for Germany party (AfD) has received growing support from the region in recent elections. Its party platform has called for prioritizing local employment over any urgency to Germany's climate transition.

Parties at the opposite end of the spectrum have voiced similar concerns.

""A structural change requires time ¨C time more than money,"" said Torsten Herbst, a member of parliament from the Free Democrats Party representing the region.

""We need an attractive mix for business investors to invest in new industrial jobs. That means lower business tax, a better digital infrastructure, also faster permits for industrial installations.""

Under the original deal, the German government pledged $47 billion to soften the blow that an end to coal production would likely have on the region ¨C $5 billion of that is destined for utility companies that close plants, while the rest would help finance a major economic transition.

Even with additional funding, skeptics say it may be impossible to switch out of coal sooner than planned. Construction of renewable sources has slowed in recent years and the country doesn't have enough wind farms or solar panels to meet current supply demands.

""Germany sees itself very much as a leader in climate mitigation, but if we look at the last 10 years, we must admit that we've been lagging behind in slowing down,"" said Timon Wehnert, a researcher on energy transitions at the Wupper Institute.

Construction of additional facilities is planned for the next decade, but storing the excess energy for rainy days is likely to pose a problem.

""Every day is not a sunny day in Germany. Every day is not a windy day in Germany. And the storage facilities for these types of energy sources are very low at present,"" he added. ""In the long term, we need to think about the storage question."""

The bond: Japanese war orphans and their Chinese parents,"06:27

When Xu Shilan was little, she asked her father which date she was born on after seeing other kids celebrate their birthdays. Her father paused, then uttered, ""July 20 is your lunar birthday."" Years later she learned that July 20 on the lunar calendar is in fact August 15 in the year of 1945, the day Japan surrendered to the Allies, bringing an end to WWII. She recounted this childhood memory, sitting on her bed in a cozy bungalow opening to a backyard studded with mottled pots of flowers. We made the visit to her home in the northeastern Chinese town of Fangzheng, 120 miles away from the capital city of Harbin in Heilongjiang Province. Upon arriving, she was already waiting for us, dressed in a claret-red coat and her neatly combed jet black hair, which her daughter said she had helped dye. It's hard to tell her exact age from her wrinkled face and diminishing hearing, yet she was able to articulate her thoughts clearly. She believes she's 80 years old, but there's no way to be sure, since her father had her age set at 19 in the year she got married. She'd lived a peaceful life with her family ¨C a loving husband and three children ¨C until one day in the year 2000 when she came across a man who was surprised to see her and asked, ""Why are you still in town? They've already gone back to Japan."" That statement made her realize why she had been called ""little Jap"" by neighboring kids when she was little. The man turned out to have handed her over to her foster parents in the final days of WWII. At the time, he encountered a feeble Japanese woman in the street who had begged him to take care of her baby girl. A poor 19-year-old himself, he couldn't afford to raise a child and hence went searching for a kindhearted family to take her in. Finally the toddler, groaning with fever and pain, was rescued by a young couple. ""Your foster father repeatedly warned me against telling that you are a Japanese orphan,"" the man told Xu, a promise that he kept for over half a century.

In those days of turmoil following the war that had begun with the Japanese invasion on September 18, 1931, Chinese foster families chose to keep secret their adoption of Japanese children, afraid that a target would be painted on the backs of these young lives. After all, they were the children of the enemy. Sun Yuqin, who lives a 30-minute drive away from Xu, only came to know that she's Japanese when her foster mother was dying in 1968. ""When I was seven, a neighbor ¨C a Japanese woman known as a 'stranded war wife' ¨C told me I'm Japanese. I ran home seeking confirmation from my mother. My mother said, 'No, you are definitely Chinese',"" Sun, now 76, told us. Unlike Xu, she knew how old she was because she was born in her foster parents' home. In the days shortly before Japan's defeat, Sun's biological mother was about to give birth and hid along with her father in a cornfield behind what was back then her Chinese parents' house. ""My foster family found them and let them in the house since my birth mother's amniotic fluid broke in a gush. Days later, my foster mother delivered me. By then news came that Japan had surrendered and my biological parents left in spite of persuasion,"" Sun said. ""After finding my biological parents dead in a battle, my foster family realized they must protect and bring me up."" Sun showed us the mark on her right leg ¨C the scar of a scratch left by her birth mother, along with a brown tweed coat and a letter with their family information in it. Sun wore that coat for decades before turning it into a smaller jacket for her grandson. As for the letter, she found it in an embroidered shoe according to the clue her foster mother offered. It's now become a mess of erasures and stains after all these years.

Adopting the enemy's children Xu and Sun are the only Japanese war orphans who are still alive in Fangzheng, the quiet, scarcely populated county in China peppered with billboards in both the Chinese and Japanese languages. The small town's complicated ties with Japan date back to September 18, 1931. With the Japanese invasion of northeast China came an emigration program to settle 1 million Japanese households, roughly 5 million people, in northeast China over the following 20 years, as part of Japan's effort to colonize the fertile, resource-rich region. ""Officials, factory managers, railway workers, and mostly, farmers, came in throngs with the creation of the puppet state known as Manchuria. First the men arrived, then the women followed, with families right behind, turning Chinese villages into Japanese communities,"" Meng Yueming, deputy director of the Institute of Northeast Asian Studies at the Shenyang Academy of Social Sciences, explained. ""Many rural Japanese were deceived by the Japanese government at the time who had promised them a better life and land possession.""

Japan sent over 380,000 agrarian emigrants, most of them living a destitute and depressed life in rural Japan. In northeastern China, they tilled the land the Japanese army confiscated from Chinese peasants and also hired Chinese as laborers. In a way, they developed sophisticated relationships with the locals, filled with a mixture of agony, hatred and sympathy. Fangzheng was home to a large number of such Japanese settlements. Xu said her foster father utterly detested them as he was badly beaten by some Japanese while working for them. In the final years of WWII, male Japanese farmers were conscripted and became part of the Japanese army reserve to help fight its war, leaving behind women, children and the elderly. In August 1945, Japan surrendered as the Soviet army advanced. An exodus began.

However, the Japanese government did not immediately notify the farmers. ""They were afraid they would be a burden to post-war Japan, so they adopted a policy of 'abandoning emigrants',"" explained Meng, who's studied the population of Japanese war orphans for years. ""The low-level Japanese settlers were left to sink or swim."" After a few days of walking to rail stations or ports in the hope of returning to Japan, they were either exhausted or fell ill. Some mothers, hounded by hunger and disease, started to give up their children, starting with the youngest who couldn't walk. They either abandoned them in the hope that kindred locals would give them a chance to live or entrusted them to Chinese families. In the latter case, most mothers left a keepsake noting their name, birth, and home address in Japan, according to Meng. There were also cases of military leaders ordering mothers to strangle their children for fear that their crying would reveal their whereabouts during the retreat. Tragedies abounded, in addition to hundreds of group suicides in the spirit of ""Japanese militarism."" Incomplete statistics show more than 4,000 Japanese orphans under the age of 13 were left behind, 90 percent of them the offspring of emigrants.

In the overcast days after August 15, some 10,000 Japanese emigrants in Fangzheng tried to make their way to Harbin to catch a train back. ""Cold, hungry, and trapped by Soviet soldiers, some 5,000 people died,"" Cao Songxian, director of Fangzheng's overseas Chinese federation, told us on the way to Xu's home. He pointed to the gun turrets and airports the Japanese built in the small county. ""Babies were just crying along the dirt street, and local Chinese took them home."" Impoverished themselves, they managed to raise the children with all they could. ""Everyone was living on very short commons in those tumultuous years but they'd starve themselves to feed the children,"" Meng said. ""My foster parents have five kids but I'm their favorite,"" said Sun, who has an elder sister and three younger cousins. ""Every Spring Festival, I'm the only one in the family to wear new clothes while my sisters had to wear old coats and pants of mine."" Moreover, she's also the only one among all the girls to have graduated from junior high, while all her sisters dropped out from elementary school. ""Upon graduation, I became the first female tractor driver in Fangzheng,"" she exclaimed, wearing a proud look. These Chinese parents also shielded the kids from any psychological trauma. Despite the myriad atrocities the Japanese imposed on him, Xu's foster father would take the issue up with the parents of the children who called her ""little Jap."" Once she got angry with her father for not allowing her to play with a kid in the neighborhood, only to learn later that he was protecting her. That was also something Liu Guizhi's foster parents would do every time she was bullied. Liu's story is more painful. She's orphaned twice ¨C her stepfather gave her up and 13 years later her foster parents died of illness.

The three war orphans we reached out to have varied life trajectories, yet what ties them together is that they were all adopted and raised by Chinese families, married into Chinese families and don't speak good Japanese. 'China is my home, forever' Not long after Liu was born in 1940, her father joined the Japanese emigrants to Harbin. Two years later, her biological mother eventually carried her on her back to look for her father. After a difficult journey, they were finally able to reach the settlement where her father was stationed, only to discover that he left to fight in the military. Penniless, they had to beg on the streets while they continued to look for him. One day news came that her father had died. Her mother tied the knot again with a Japanese man who took Liu as a burden and gave her to a childless Chinese couple. ""I was treated like a princess, even after my brother was born in 1947,"" she told us through the phone. She went back to Japan's Saitama Prefecture, her hometown, in 1990, under a repatriation program launched by both the Chinese and Japanese governments. The programs started in 1981, three years after the two countries established diplomatic ties. Liu was part of the second batch to return to Japan and took the name of Keiko Matsuda. Japan has so far recognized 2,818 war orphans, among them 2,557 have gone back to Japan and 260 chose to stay. ""Many chose to stay in China and there are also those who made it back to China after spending some time in Japan because of bias and discrimination, both conscious and unconscious,"" said Du Ying, director of the Institute of Japanese Studies at the Heilongjiang Academy of Social Sciences. ""That part of history was basically in oblivion in the memories of many Japanese before the 1980s. So it's very difficult for the war orphans to live a decent life back in Japan."" Liu experienced a down period, taking as many part-time jobs as she could. But a tough woman, she managed to lead a happy life with her big family.

Will less exams and tutoring mean more freedom for Chinese pupils?,"Beijing native Qi Fang, 38, said she was not a helicopter parent. But earlier this year, she signed her eight-year-old son up for tutoring in four curriculum subjects. And on top of that, a coding class. What prompted her to change was the fact that her son recently scored lowest in his class. And she blamed herself for not being invested enough in her son's education. In his class, at one of the top schools in Beijing, every student attended after-school tutoring, and many of their parents took days off to accompany their children to tutoring classes so that they could teach them after class. ""It is an education arms race between parents, and I am clearly falling behind,"" said Qi. China's education system is known for its exceptionally competitive nature. And parents, anxious about their children's future, have been dragged into a tutoring arms race. A 2019 report published by the China National Children's Center and the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences showed that parents spend average 9,211 yuan ($1,425) a year on after-school tutoring, accounting for 12.84 percent of a family's income. Most of the parents who sent their children to after-school tutoring wanted to give them a leg up in the highly competitive exam-based system. But that quickly spiraled into a vicious cycle of competition. Because private training institutions frequently jump ahead of and cover areas not on the formal syllabus, for students who haven't yet signed up for the after-class tutoring, it becomes a necessity in order to catch up.

Liu Hong, a mother of two, who was originally from east China's Shandong Province and has now settled down in Beijing, said she started to assign her child college-level English test papers when the kid was still in primary school. At the age of 12, the child scored 151 out of 160 in an FCE test run by Cambridge English, one that is normally taken by university students to demonstrate an upper level command of English. ""That can help her stand out among the rest when applying for middle school,"" she said. For many parents from places other than Beijing and Shanghai, education is what provided them mobility, and they desperately want to maintain their middle-class status, said Ye Liu, senior lecturer at international development of King's College London who researches education and equality. ""They are worried that their children would slide down in social class,"" she noted. But all of those stand in the way of China's pursuit of educational equality. The high fees charged by training schools were a significant source of economic pressure and served as a strong deterrence towards parents who wanted to have more children, at a time when China is rapidly aging.

In what has been termed the harshest curb on after-school tutoring, China recently issued a series of policies for its latest education reforms. The scheduling of classes during weekends and holidays was canceled, and online classes were all capped at a half-hour per session. The most drastic of all is the rule which says the homework time for primary school students from the third to sixth grade should be no more than 60 minutes, and for those in the first and second grade, there should be no written homework and tests at all. The reforms aim to reduce the academic burden on students and take off some of the pressure felt by parents amid the cut-throat competition in the education sector, according to the government. An English teacher at a public middle school in Daxing District, the suburban area of Beijing, said she adjusted her modes of instruction after the reform measure came into place. Homework was cut down significantly, from 45 minutes of English study to 15 minutes per day. Previously, she would assign reciting the text as part of the homework. Now, she reserves part of the class time to her students to finish the task. ""The policy would work best for students who are smart, and who have an interest and determination to keep up with the school work,"" she said. ""But for those, who have no interest or determination to study, without the added pressure from tutoring and cram school, they might immediately fall back to their normal selves.""

Cui Lu, a teacher from one of the most prestigious middle schools in Haidian District, a hub for top schools in Beijing, said banning cram schools would help students reorient their focus on school work. ""Since cram schools often jump ahead of public schools' schedule, they break the systematic approach to learning that teachers planned for instruction."" At such a young age, the most important factor for students is not knowledge per se, but to cultivate good learning habits and systematic ways of studying, she noted. Deficiencies in the public education system, such as large class sizes and lack of quality teaching, are often cited as reasons behind the popularity of after-school tutoring in China. And some parents expressed concerns that without addressing deficiencies in the public education system, parents would always have the incentive to hire private one-to-one tutors or choose to train their kids by themselves. ""It's parents against parents now,"" said Qi. With the weekend tutoring cancelled, she bought a number of instructional manuals and prepared to teach her son at home after school ends each day."

Chinese drugmaker Sinopharm said on Friday that its newly developed vaccines targeting the Delta and Beta variants of the novel coronavirus are very effective.

Zhang Yuntao, chief scientist of China National Biotec Group (CNBG), a subsidiary of Sinopharm, made the remarks during an aired interview with China Media Group.

The company debuted four upgraded vaccines targeting the now widespread COVID-19 Delta and Beta variants during the 2021 China International Fair for Trade in Services (CIFTIS) held in Beijing from September 2 to 7.

The four second-generation COVID-19 vaccines belong to three types: inactivated, recombinant protein and mRNA.

Among them, the broad-spectrum recombinant protein vaccine has completed phase-I and phase-II clinical trials, Zhu Jingjin, Party chief of CNBG, said during the CIFTIS.

The two new inactivated vaccines are the upgraded versions of the two vaccines developed by CNBG's subsidiary Beijing Institute of Biological Products(BIBP) and the Wuhan Institute of Biological Products(WIBP) respectively, which have been on the market since the beginning of this year.

CNBG is seeking approval from China's drug regulator for the clinical trials of the upgraded BIBP and WIBP inactivated vaccines, Zhang said. Since China has controlled the COVID-19 epidemic, and there are not many cases in the country, large-scale clinical trials of the vaccines will be conducted in overseas countries, he said.

The company will speed up the clinical trials of the vaccines in other countries to test their effectiveness against COVID-19 variants once they get approval, he said, adding that the company hopes to obtain the results of the trials by mid-2022 and promote the availability of the vaccines on the market afterward.

The existing inactivated vaccines developed by Sinopharm and Sinovac Biotech are still effective against the Delta and Beta variants, he said, citing lab experiment results and real-world data in south China's Guangdong Province and a dozen of countries, including Sri Lanka and Mongolia.

For the time being, those who need a boost dose will still get existing vaccines, he said.

But the development of upgraded vaccines targeting COVID-19 variants is to get people better prepared in the future, he said."

Xi urges early return of China-U.S. relations back to right track,"Chinese President Xi Jinping on Friday morning took a phone call from his U.S. counterpart, Joe Biden, and the two leaders had candid, in-depth and extensive strategic communication and exchanges on China-U.S. relations and relevant issues of mutual interest.



Xi first expressed sympathy to Biden and the American people over the human and economic toll in multiple places in the United States caused by Hurricane Ida. Biden appreciated the expression of sympathy.



'China-U.S. relations vital to world's future'



Xi pointed out that for some time, due to the U.S. policy on China, the China-U.S. relationship has run into serious difficulty.



""This serves neither the fundamental interests of the people of the two countries, nor the common interests of countries around the world,"" said the Chinese president.



China and the United States are respectively the biggest developing country and the biggest developed country. Whether they can handle their relationship well bears on the future of the world, Xi noted.



""It is a question of the century to which the two countries must provide a good answer. When China and the United States cooperate, the two countries and the world will benefit; when China and the United States are in confrontation, the two countries and the world will suffer,"" Xi said, adding that getting the relationship back to the right track is not optional, but something we must do and must do well.



'Bring bilateral ties back to right track'



Xi highlighted an ancient Chinese poem, ""Mountains and rivers may block the way, yet another village will appear amidst willow trees and blooming flowers.""



Since the ice was broken in bilateral relations in 1971, China and the United States have cooperated with each other and delivered tangible benefits to countries around the world, he said.



With the international community facing many common challenges, he called on China and the United States to show broad vision and shoulder great responsibilities.



""The two countries should look ahead and press forward, demonstrate strategic courage and political resolve, and bring China-U.S. relations back to the right track of stable development as soon as possible for the good of the people in both countries and around the world,"" Xi said.



Xi also elaborated on China's position on climate change and other issues.



He stressed that China continues to prioritize ecological conservation and pursues a green and low-carbon path to development, and has taken the initiative to actively shoulder international responsibilities befitting China's national conditions.



On the basis of respecting each other's core concerns and properly managing differences, he called on relevant departments of the two countries to continue their engagement and dialogue to advance coordination and cooperation on climate change, COVID-19 response and economic recovery as well as on major international and regional issues.



In the meantime, the two sides may tap more potential of cooperation to inject more positive dynamics into the relationship, Xi said.



Biden: Both sides have no interest in letting competition veer into conflict



Biden noted that the world is changing fast. ""The U.S.-China relationship is the most consequential relationship in the world, and the future of the bulk of the world will depend on how the United States and China get on with each other.""



""The two countries have no interest in letting competition veer into conflict. The U.S. side has no intention to change the one-China policy. It is prepared to have more candid exchanges and constructive discussions with China to identify key and priority areas where cooperation is possible, avoid miscommunication, miscalculation and unintended conflict, and get U.S.-China relations back on track,"" Biden stressed.



The U.S. side looks forward to more discussions and cooperation with China to reach more common positions on climate change and other important issues, he added.



Both presidents agreed that in-depth communication between them on China-U.S. relations and major international issues is very important for steering the bilateral ties in the right direction.



They agreed to maintain frequent contact by multiple means and instruct officials at the working level to intensify the work, conduct extensive dialogue and create conditions for the further development of China-U.S. relations."
New treasure: Bronze sacred tree unearthed from Sanxingdui Ruins site,"A new bronze sacred tree has been unearthed from the No. 3 pit of the Sanxingdui Ruins site in southwest China's Sichuan Province following months of excavation efforts.

Earlier in March, Chinese archaeologists discovered six new sacrificial pits at the ancient ruins site with hundreds of artifacts discovered, among which the No. 3 sacrificial pit was found housing over 100 pieces ivory and bronze ware.

Xu Feihong, team head in charge of the No. 3 pit's excavation, said part of the bronze sacred tree was exposed at the center of the pit in March. However, it took some four months to complete the job as the trunk was pressed tightly with ivory artifacts buried under piles of other items.

The newly unearthed sacred tree wasn't the only of its kind found at Sanxingdui. Back in 1986, several sacred trees were found in No. 2 pit, of which only three could be restored and numbered in sequence.

According to Xu, the new one is similar to the No. 2 bronze tree which took archaeologists over a decade to restore. Yet, it's still not complete with several parts missing.

""It cannot be ruled out that these two might belong to the same tree. If the two sacred trees in pits No. 2 and No. 3 are put together, they can explain a lot of academic issues,"" said Xu.

Hailed as one of the most important ancient remains found in the 20th century, the Sanxingdui Ruins site is a treasure house filled with a trove of pottery, jade, bronze, and gold wares dating back some 3,000 years.

Excavation is still going on at the sacrificial pits and more treasures are to be brought to light.

President Xi hailed the ""vigorous growth"" of the SCO and the ""fruitful, mutually beneficial cooperation"" among its member states during the past two decades.



""Guided by the Shanghai Spirit of mutual trust, mutual benefit, equality, consultation, respect for diversity of civilizations and pursuit of common development, the SCO has endeavored to promote world peace, development and human progress, and to explore new ground, both theoretically and with actual steps, with a view to building a new type of international relations and a community with a shared future for mankind,"" the Chinese president said.



SCO member states have jointly promoted political mutual trust, ensured security and stability, pursued prosperity and development, and upheld international justice, he added.



""We were the first to call for fighting terrorism, separatism and extremism,"" Xi said, underscoring cooperation among SCO members states in curbing the spread of drug trafficking and holding counter-terrorism exercises and border control operations.

'Closer SCO community with a shared future'

The SCO has reached a ""new historical starting point"" after 20 years of development, President Xi said, calling for efforts to ""build a closer SCO community with a shared future"" and make further contributions to lasting global peace and common prosperity.



The organization should stay committed to enhancing solidarity and cooperation, upholding common security, promoting openness and integration, boosting interactions and mutual learning, and upholding equity and justice, he said.



The Chinese president called on SCO member states to enhance policy dialogue, communication and coordination and respect each other's legitimate concerns in their cooperation so as to keep the organization ""on a steady course of development.""



""We should maintain firm confidence in our systems, reject condescending lecturing, and firmly support countries in exploring development paths and governance models that are compatible with their national conditions,"" he said. ""We should keep the future of our countries' development and progress firmly in our own hands.""

'Most pressing task'

Stressing that the fight against COVID-19 remains the ""most pressing task,"" President Xi called for joint efforts among the member states to deepen cooperation against the pandemic, promote fair and equitable distribution of vaccines and firmly oppose any act of politicizing COVID-19 origins tracing.



China has provided approximately 1.2 billion doses of finished and bulk vaccines to over 100 countries and international organizations, he said, adding that China will step up efforts to provide a total of two billion doses to other countries this year.

To facilitate post-COVID economic recovery in the region, China will strive to reach $2.3 trillion in its cumulative trade with other SCO countries in the next five years, Xi said.



China will also provide 1,000 training opportunities in poverty alleviation for other SCO countries in the next three years, he announced.

SCO cooperation on Afghanistan

President Xi called for tough actions from SCO member states to combat terrorism, separatism and extremism, including the East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM).



Commenting on the ""daunting challenges"" faced by Afghanistan after the withdrawal of foreign troops, he called on SCO member states to make full use of platforms such as the SCO-Afghanistan Contact Group and facilitate a smooth transition in the country.



""We need to encourage Afghanistan to put in place a broad-based and inclusive political framework, adopt prudent and moderate domestic and foreign policies, resolutely fight all forms of terrorism, live in amity with its neighbors and truly embark on a path of peace, stability and development,"" he stressed.



The Afghan Taliban took control of Kabul on August 15 and announced the formation of a caretaker government earlier this month. China has urged the Taliban to make a clean break with all terrorist organizations, including the ETIM, and resolutely fight against them. The Taliban have pledged not to allow Afghan territory to be used ""against anybody or any country in the world.""

"National Games: Gong claims 4th straight title, Su aims for first gold","Olympic champion Gong Lijiao won her fourth straight women's shot put title at China's National Games in Xi'an City, northwest China's Shaanxi Province, on Monday, becoming the first Chinese track and field athlete to score four back-to-back wins at the event, which are held only every four years.



Gong, who delivered her country's first gold in field events at the Tokyo Olympics last month, recorded a throw of 19.88 meters in her fourth attempt to seal her victory.

Her teammate Song Jiayuan from Shanghai took the silver with 19.76 meters, with the bronze going to Zhang Linru from Hebei.

""Winning four championship titles in a row is great. I hope there will be a fifth,"" she said.

""I think it has proved my dominance in the sport. Today (teammate) Song Jiayuan performed really well. I hope there are others who can take my place when I retire,"" Gong added in a post-match interview.

Gong's coach Li Meisu noted: ""It was really difficult for her to persevere in this sport.""

""All these years, her dream was to win gold at the Olympics. Now she has finally realized that dream, I hope she can achieve more."""
"Xi highlights education, cultural protection in visit to Shaanxi","00:57

Chinese President Xi Jinping on Tuesday stressed better education to ensure all-round development of the country's youths during a visit to a middle school in Suide, a county under the city of Yulin in northwest China's Shaanxi Province, during his inspection tour in the province. ""[I hope you can be] all-round talents, and carry that momentum forward step by step. Be the ones that can contribute to the society in the future, and the backbone of China,"" he told the students of a middle school he visited. The same day, Xi, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, visited a revolutionary site ¨C the old site of Former Prefectural Committee of CPC, an exhibition hall for local intangible cultural heritage and a village.

He conducted field research on local efforts in carrying forward the CPC's traditions and style of work, promoting all-round development and healthy growth of students, enhancing the protection and inheritance of traditional culture, and advancing rural revitalization on all fronts.

During his visit to the old site of Former Prefectural Committee of the CPC in Suide to honor the revolution history, Xi hailed the spirit upheld by revolutionaries of the old generations, who always prioritize the Party's interests and stand with the majority of the laboring people, and noted that the spirit is of great inspiration. He urged Party members to carry on the revolutionary tradition, remain true to the original aspiration and keep the mission firmly in mind, and always stand and work together with the people.

At the exhibition hall for intangible cultural heritage in Suide, Xi praised the local protection and inheritance of the traditional culture. Noting that Suide is one of the important origins of the Loess Culture with abundant resources of intangible cultural heritage and traditional folk arts, Xi highlighted the importance of protecting folk arts as they are the precious fortune of the Chinese nation, and are of great importance in the course of building a socialist country with advanced culture. He called on officials to find the link between traditional culture and modern life so as to meet people's ever-growing needs for a better life.

At Haojiaqiao Village, Xi learned about the revolutionary history of the village along with its achievements in poverty alleviation. The village has been actively developing its characteristic industry since the 18th CPC National Congress held in 2012. The great efforts have brought dramatic change to the villagers' life. Hou Zhirong and his family is a good example. Plagued by illness, he managed to shake off poverty in 2016 thanks to local government's support and his own efforts. Xi extended his congratulations to the Hous and stressed that ensuring a better life for the Chinese people is always the aspiration and mission of the CPC. He urged the whole country to carry forward the spirit of poverty alleviation, work hard and strive to build the country into a modern socialist country.

At the village's greenhouse base of vegetables and fruits, Xi learned about the village's industry planning and development situation. The Chinese president attributed the village's success to appropriate policies, diligent people and favored environmental conditions. The point, according to Xi, is to conduct in-depth research, figuring out problems, raising solutions and summarizing experiences. He hopes other places could learn from the successful experience of Haojiaqiao Village.

A view inside the launch ceremony of the Games motto of Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games Beijing 2022 in Beijing, China, September 17, 2021. /CGTN

Beijing 2022 on Friday sent out warm invitations worldwide with the unveiling of ""Together for a Shared Future"" as its official motto.

An expert panel selected the motto from 79 proposals submitted since May 2020 and finalized after repeated discussions.

As the Beijing 2022 organizers explained, ""Together"" depicts how mankind stays strong when facing adversities and points out the solution to overcome those difficulties and create a better future; ""For a shared future"" embodies a vision for a better life and conveys hope and confidence.

""The motto advocates a universal goal of unity, peace, progress and inclusiveness. It's the Chinese interpretation of the newly revised Olympic motto of 'Faster, Higher, Stronger - Together,'"" Beijing 2022 said in a press release.

Chen Jining, Beijing mayor and the executive president of the Beijing 2022 Organizing Committee (BOCOG), expressed his belief that the release of the motto will attract more people to pay attention to Beijing 2022 and join in efforts to deliver a successful Games under the COVID-19 pandemic.

""It embeds our aspiration that people around the world could strengthen solidarity, support each other and join hands for a better future,"" he noted.

Chen Ning, director of the BOCOG's culture and ceremonies department, underlined that the motto is in line with China's initiative of building a community with a shared future for humanity, reflects the common aspiration worldwide of joining hands for a better future, especially facing the COVID-19 challenges, and the core value and vision of the Olympic Movement.

""Beijing will become the first city to host both summer and winter Olympics. This motto carries on the legacy from 'One World One Dream' of Beijing 2008, and reveals the characteristics of this era,"" he said.

He was echoed by Jiang Xiaoyu, vice president of the Beijing Olympic City Development Association, who believes the motto is a call from China.

""The motto of the 2008 games conveys China's view of the world. This time it takes a step further, not only shares our view but voices our attitude. It is more appealing and more passionate,"" he commented.

The Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics will run between February 4 and 20, with the Winter Paralympics following between March 4 and 13."
Fed's upcoming meeting may further confirm 'taper will happen soon',"Editor's note: Jimmy Zhu is chief strategist at Singapore-based Fullerton Research. The article reflects the author's opinion, and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

Global financial markets have become more cautious over the past few days, with U.S. stocks suffering the worst day since May. Those who anticipate another dovish outcome from the upcoming Fed meeting may be disappointed.

The Fed is highly likely to provide more details on quantitative easing tapering in its policy meeting this week, even with some of its recent economic data showing a slowing down of the recovery. If Jerome Powell's Fed continues to skip the messages on a reduction in bond purchases, his credibility would be challenged.

Powell said that the Federal Open Market Committee could start to taper within 2021 at the virtual Jackson Hole symposium last month, though he still didn't see rate hikes in the near term. He also mentioned the U.S. economy has reached a point where it no longer needs much more of the stimulus that was implemented over the past year and a half. Since the Jackson Hole symposium, the fundamentals of the U.S economy haven't made many changes.

The U.S. added 235,000 jobs for August, following a gain of over one million jobs in July, and those gains helped the unemployment rate fall to 5.2 percent last month. On the other hand, the consumer price index has been exceeding 2 percent since March. Having said that, the Fed has little reason to further delay the quantitative easing tapering, because both the labor market and inflation outlook have been moving toward its policy goal.

Furthermore, recent reports showed that various top Fed officials have had a large amount of personal investments in 2020, including Powell. This is definitely not good news for the Fed's credibility and policy independence. Since Powell has already mentioned that tapering this year is likely to be the case, he has to follow the policy outlook he illustrated last month, otherwise, his credibility may face more scrutiny from market participants.

On the other hand, the Fed needs some policy room if any economic condition in the future requires more support. Fed's current policy rate at near-zero levels and unprecedented high balance sheet levels mean there would be no room for further easing if the U.S. economy is to encounter any unexpected shocks. Before the Fed conducts more monetary easing again, it needs to raise the rates by a few hundred basis points or reduce the one-third of the current balance sheet's size based on our analysis.

S&P 500 dropped 1.7 percent on Monday, the declines also reflect the facts that the current U.S. stocks are very sensitive to any negative news or events, and this is due to its overstretched valuations. Looking ahead, U.S. stocks are likely to face increasing downward pressure amid less support in monetary stimulus by the Fed. Over the past year and a half, the monetary stimulus was the major driver behind the U.S. stocks' rally. However, the stocks are still not far away from their record levels in August.

Current stock levels that are still near historical highs show markets have yet to price in the downside risk from the Fed's potential tightening ahead. Once the Fed starts to taper in later of the year, investors' focus is likely to switch to speculating on the timing of rate hike by observing the Fed's dot plot on rates' projection, which could push the dollar significantly higher from the current levels if 2014 is a reliable guide. When ex-Fed chief Ben Bernanke said the Fed would begin paring down its bond purchases in December 2013, the dollar gained around 15 percent in the next 12 months.

Any dollar appreciation would have a significant negative impact on both stocks and commodities. Since the pandemic hit the U.S. economy in March 2020, the negative correlation between the dollar index and S&P 500 index stood at 0.76. Also, the negative correlation between the dollar and crude oil stood at 0.73 in this period.

Rising commodity prices are one of the main reasons that are causing the persistently high inflation in the U.S. economy. If a higher dollar would help to lower the prices of commodities and import goods, it will be an efficient way to ease the rising inflation pressure. Hence, the Fed has valid reasons to be comfortable with its policy if it drives the greenback higher, though traders on Wall Street may not like it."
Delta variant clouds developing Asia's growth outlook ¨C ADB,"Developing Asia's economic rebound this year could be dented by the rapid spread of the Delta variant of the coronavirus, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) said on Wednesday.

However, the bank forecast the East Asia economy will expand by 7.6 percent this year, compared with an earlier prediction of 7.4 percent, citing its vaccination rates as among the highest in the region and governments that were quick to contain outbreaks.

Growth in developing Asia, which groups 46 countries in the Asia-Pacific, is projected to reach 7.1 percent this year, the ADB said in an update to its Asia Development Outlook report, down from its 7.2 percent forecast in July and 7.3 percent in April.

""Developing Asia remains vulnerable to the COVID-19 pandemic, as new variants spark outbreaks, leading to renewed restrictions on mobility in some economies,"" ADB Acting Chief Economist Joseph Zveglich said in a statement.

The ADB said the recovery path within the region remained uneven, given countries' varying degrees of progress in tackling the pandemic.

China is on track to grow 8.1 percent this year, with the pace of expansion projected to slow to 5.5 percent next year, the ADB said.

Southeast Asia, including virus-ravaged Indonesia and the Philippines, was expected to grow 3.1 percent this year, compared with a previous forecast of 4.4 percent.

The ADB expects the Pacific to contract 0.6 percent, having forecast 1.4 percent growth in April.

Italy began administering booster COVID-19 vaccine shots on Monday, after the procedure received the official green light from the country's Medicines Agency (AIFA).

As the Health Ministry announced earlier this month, third doses of either Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccines will be offered to people with fragile immune systems.

This includes not only immuno-compromised people such as transplant patients but also elderly people and residents in care homes. Based on guidelines issued by AIFA, healthcare workers will also receive the booster shot.

The third dose will be offered as an option, since vaccination against coronavirus is strongly recommended but not mandatory in Italy.

AIFA has recommended that the third shot should be available at least 28 days after the previous dose for immuno-compromised people.

For those over 80, people living in care homes, and healthcare professionals, the third dose would be considered as a ""booster to maintain an effective immune response,"" and should be administered at least 6 months after their last dose.

Overall, AIFA and the Health Ministry have stressed that the national priority should remain to ensure that a majority of the population is vaccinated.

As of Monday, some 76 percent of the target population (those aged over 12) had been fully immunized, while 82 percent had received at least one dose, data from the Health Ministry has shown.

Since the pandemic broke out in Italy in February 2020, some 4.6 million coronavirus cases have been confirmed. There have been over 130,000 fatalities and 4.4 million recoveries."
"UK records 31,564 cases, 203 deaths with 7,731 patients in hospital","The UK has recorded 203 more coronavirus-related deaths and 31,564 new cases in the latest 24-hour period, with the number of COVID patients in hospital now at 7,731.

The latest figures compare with 36,100 new cases and 49 coronavirus deaths reported on Monday.

This time last week, 26,628 cases and 185 deaths were recorded.

Since the start of the pandemic, 135,455 people have died within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test.

Meanwhile, another 24,684 people were given their first dose of a COVID vaccine on Monday, taking the total to 48,617,703 (89.4 percent of over-16s in the UK).

A further 46,451 people were given their second jab, meaning 44,512,572 are now fully inoculated (81.9 percent).

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres addresses the General Assembly via a live stream in New York, U.S., September 21, 2021. /CFP

When three billionaires rocketed into space this summer, they did more than escape Earth's surly bonds, they helped spread ""a malady of mistrust"" plaguing an all-too-hungry world, United Nations (UN) Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told other world leaders Tuesday.

In his opening speech to the General Assembly, a grim Guterres highlighted the gap between the rich and poor with ""billionaires joyriding to space while millions go hungry on Earth.""

In July, billionaires Richard Branson and Jeff Bezos flew into space on private rockets that their companies built, gathering worldwide attention in their short trips that didn't make it into orbit. Both bank on space tourism business from their fellow space fans with big wallets.

After returning to Earth, Branson, 71, sprayed G.H. Mumm champagne over his crew and then chugged it from the bottle.

Billionaire Jared Isaacman led the first all-private orbital mission that splashed down Saturday after three days in orbit. His flight was on a Dragon capsule and Space X rocket built by a fourth space-obsessed billionaire, Elon Musk. Unlike the other two missions, Isaacman's ride raised more than $200 million for St. Jude Children's Research Hospital including $100 million from Isaacman and $50 million from Musk.

Guterres lumped billionaire space hops with the maladies of hopelessness, corruption, curtailing of personal freedoms and ""when parents see a future for their children that looks even bleaker than the struggles of today.""

After Branson and Bezos spaceflights and revelations that Bezos, the richest man in the world, didn't pay any federal income tax in 2007 and 2011, critics called for taxing billionaires with some wanting to tax them out of the 10-digit income level. So far those proposals, unlike the billionaires, haven't gotten off the ground."

In the process of film festival award selection, the criteria of the jury have always been the focus of attention. Gong Li, who has served as a jury member many times, said she will watch films rationally, but each jury member is free to give their opinion.

Jury president Gong Li, judges Chen Kun, Wuershan, Zhang Songwen, and Leste Chen attended the press conference and expressed the criteria for the award selection respectively. Finnish film director Renny Harlin and Lebanese actress and director Nadine Labaki met online due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Judge Zhang Songwen, known for starring in the 2020 drama ""The Bad Kids,"" admitted ""no one can be 100 percent rational,"" when discussing the 15 films on the shortlist.

However, he said he would watch them again and again to find out what was good about them. ""There must be a reason they're in the selection,"" he said. ""I don't know what the criteria are. I just know that watching a movie should be the same as watching art exhibitions and listening to music. There should be a personal orientation in it.""

Chen Kun believed that a good performance is particularly personal and subjective. He said he hoped that he could remain objective throughout the judging process.

The 11th BJIFF runs from September 21 to 29, with nearly 300 films to be screened, according to the organizers.

Indonesia has extended the public activity restriction policy, locally known as PPKM, in Java and Bali, which was previously set to end on Monday, until Oct. 4, a senior minister said on Monday.

""The PPKM is extended for two more weeks in Java and Bali,"" Coordinating Minister for Maritime and Investment affairs Luhut Binsar Pandjaitan told a virtual press conference.

The Southeast Asian country, which has just emerged from the peak of the COVID-19 second wave triggered by the more contagious Delta variant, now has a positivity rate of less than 2 percent.

The authorities have asked people not to be euphoric and remain cautious as the risk of transmission is still high.

The Indonesian government continues to conduct weekly evaluations to anticipate any rapid changes, Pandjaitan added."

Ivermectin overdoses,"The Rocky Mountain Poison Center gets 100,000 calls a year from people reporting that they, their family members or pets have ingested something or been exposed to or bitten by something potentially harmful.

""The concern would be like I said would be plastic, if he ingested any of the plastic.""

This year, they¡¯ve received 19 calls from people experiencing reactions to the drug ivermectin.

""They say I read about it online and I think this will prevent COVID or I have COVID and I¡¯m trying to treat myself so I don¡¯t have to go to the hospital.""

Ivermectin is traditionally used to treat worms in horses and some parasitic infections in humans. But many have turned to it as an alternative to COVID-19 vaccines. Poison Center director Shireen Banerji says 11 of the 19 Colorado cases came from intentional ingestion and that symptoms can be quite serious.

""It can affect your CNS, your central nervous system, and your brain, it can cause tremors, hallucinations, even seizures.""

""I'm very concerned people are self-treating without any kind of medical guidance and that could lead to trouble.""

""It's an amazing drug for river blindness.""

David Kroll at the C.U. Anschutz School of Pharmacy says while ivermectin has done wonders for people in Africa and is being studied in relation to COVID-19, there's no science showing it could be helpful during this pandemic.

""I'm not surprised at all. It¡¯s very easy for misinformation to spread amongst a population that already has a mistrust of experts.""

""Kroll endorses empowering patients to be partners in their own health care. He says patients have helped drive advances in areas like HIV care in the past.""

But as with the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine, he says organizations like this one, powered by social media, have led the vaccine skeptical astray.

""People are tapping into the sort of anti-pharmaceutical company mentality where of course they want you to get the vaccine because they're making billions of dollars.""

The Front Line COVID-19 Critical Care Alliance did not respond to a request for comment.

""I think the misinformation should be corrected and I think providers who are being asked by their patients for prescriptions need to really think hard, is this safe, is this effective, is this going to help my patient?""

Livestock suppliers have also seen ivermectin fly off the shelves. Large doses fit for horses have led to some human overdoses.

""It makes me worry that the resolution of the pandemic is going to be prolonged by people pursuing incompletely tested hypotheses.""

As the saying goes, ""One can go without eating meat for three days, but can't live one day without naan."" Naan, a traditional staple food, shares a long history with people of all ethnicities in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. Xinjiang naan is made of fermented dough. It is baked in a clay oven. The golden crispy crust is naan's distinctive feature. The round-shaped naan has always been a symbol of happiness and fortune. When eating Tawa Kawap, people split the naan and share with each other as sharing blessings.

Roasted Stuffed Bun. / CGTN Roasted Stuffed Bun. / CGTN

Unlike most places in China, people living in Xinjiang prefer to roast and not steam stuffed buns. This type of bun looks like a small, golden, square-shaped pillow, and is infused with the rich scent of mutton. Roasted stuffed buns are a part of the traditional nomadic lifestyle. The herdsman of Xinjiang graze cattle and sheep all throughout the year, and they only take simple tools and ingredients with them, such as a knife and flour. During lunch time, herdsmen would chop up mutton and onion for making buns, and then cook them over a fire. After settling down in cities, they started using clay ovens in order to prevent their food from carbon.

Hand-Grasped Mutton. /CGTN Hand-Grasped Mutton. /CGTN

Boiled mutton, or hand-grasped mutton, is a traditional dish of ethnic groups living in northwestern China, such as Mongolian, Tibetan, Hui and Uygur. The Uygur cooking method is the most interesting of them all. According to an ancient recipe, an entire lamb is cut into 12 pieces and then boiled with simple spices. As a chunk of meat is too big to be held by chopsticks, hands are used when eating, and hence the name.

Tonur Kawap. /CGTN Tonur Kawap. /CGTN

As a paradise for meat lovers, Xinjiang is best known for lamb kebabs, but for locals, there is nothing like grabbing some appetizing, traditional Uygur grilled lamb, also known as Tonur Kawap. Tonur Kawap has a history of over 500 years. Chefs usually hang lamb chops with iron hooks, and position them close to the inner wall of a heated clay pit. Compared with kebabs, Tonur Kawap grilled by residual heat retains more moisture, and is thus more tender with a richer taste.

You may know the saut¨¦ spicy chicken, also known as Xinjiang big plate chicken, as a famous dish that has spread all over the country. But this recipe was created less than 20 years ago by chef Li Shilin, whose specialty is the saut¨¦ spicy chicken. Back then, while his customers enjoyed the taste of the dish, they thought the portion was too small. This is why Li decided to fry a whole chicken one day, and presented it on a gigantic plate for his guests. After finishing the tantalizing dish, the customers heartily commended that the dish was very satisfying. Since then, orders of ""a big plate of chicken"" have been pouring in.

Mindful eating is one of the most popular topics of today. But a thousand years ago, Xinjiang forefathers already had their own recipe for healthy eating ¨C the pilaf. According to local legend, a doctor named Abu was in poor health, and medication did not help. Later on, Abu came up with a nutritional way to stew rice, which tasted and smelled good. He had a small bowl once in the morning and once in the evening, and his body gradually regained nourishment. He later passed on the ""healing recipe"" to villagers, and that eventually became the Lamb Pilaf, one of the most common dishes in Xinjiang.

Xinjiang Hand-pulled Noodles. /CGTN Xinjiang Hand-pulled Noodles. /CGTN

When the art of hand-pulled noodles was introduced from other parts of northwest China into Xinjiang, the locals combined it with their meat-based diet. Later the hybrid Xinjiang hand-pulled noodles dish was created. Homemade noodles have been a common staple food in northwest China for generations. As the residents of the Hexi Corridor gradually migrated up north, noodles were then introduced to Xinjiang. Local residents stir fry mutton with vegetables, and then mix it with boiled noodles. Nowadays, Xinjiang hand-pulled noodles, also known as Latiaozi, have become a part of local daily cuisine.

Xinjiang Fried Rice Noodles. /CGTN Xinjiang Fried Rice Noodles. /CGTN

For the young generation of Xinjiang, the answer to ""What should I eat today?"" and ""Let's grab something to eat"" is always that popular dish, Xinjiang Fried Rice Noodles. Xinjiang Fried Rice Noodles came from southern China, and then introduced to Xinjiang in 1982. After the recipe was modified by locals, half noodles and half spicy sauce became a unique feature of this dish. Therefore, anyone who has eaten it should not forget the fiery taste. There is a familiar story. A chief from Xinjiang traveled to southwestern Chengdu, a city known for its spicy food, to sell fried rice noodles. However, his business soon fell apart because of the local overly spicy noodles.

Tarim River is the mother river of southern Xinjiang. As the river flows through the desert, it not only waters millions of wild poplar forests, but also provides resources for people living by the sides of the river. For example, fish from the river is deeply loved by the local people. Rose Willow Grilled Fish is the most primitive food along the river. Villagers wash the fish they catch, break off branches of rose willow by the riverside, and then use them to open up the fish. People erect the willow sticks on the ground and roast them slowly over a fire. During grilling, the fresh red willow secretes juices. Eventually, the wood fragrance combines with the fish to create a memorable taste.

CGTN's new series ""Along Tibet's New Railway"" will spotlight nine main stations on the railway line ¨C Gonggar, Zhanang, Shannan, Sangri, Gyaca, Nang County, Mainling, Gangga, and Nyingchi, delving into the diverse natural resources and rich cultural backgrounds of south Tibet's cities and counties. The first episode features three cradles of Tibetan culture: Gonggar County, Zhanang County, and Shannan City.

Gonggar

Spanning upwards of 2,280 square kilometers, Gonggar County is one of the 11 counties under the jurisdiction of Shannan and home to around 53,700 inhabitants, as well as numerous wildlife species, such as wild yak, wild ass, Tibetan antelope, Tibetan gazelle, and black-necked cranes.

Gonggar has many unique historical monuments, such as Dorjedrak Monastery, sitting along the northern bank of the Yarlung Tsangpo River. The county is bounded by Chuwori Mountain, one of the most sacred mountains in Tibet, held to be ""the origin of happiness."" Among five towns of Gonggar, there is Jedeshol Town, known as the hometown of the famous apron worn by the Tibetan married women. With a history of about 600 years, the time-honored handicraft has a rainbow of colors and a distinctive style, becoming increasingly popular at home and abroad in recent years. Today, the county is regarded as an essential transportation junction in the region, as Lhasa Gonggar Airport, the largest aviation hub, was built here with its Terminal 3 to be put into operation on August 7.

Zhanang

Zhanang, also a county of Shannan, covers a total area of 2,173 square kilometers, with a population of 36,656, as well as numerous notable landmarks and historical religious sites, such Samye Monastery, the first of its kind in Tibet, and Mindroling Monastery, which was built in 1677 and contains a great number of Buddhist scriptures. Separated by the Yarlung Tsangpo River into northern and southern parts, the county has rich natural geological features, including lake, valley and caves. Among them is Chimpu Meditation Caves, a scenic spot that is located near Samye Monastery on the northern bank of the River and attracts numerous pilgrims every year. Traditionally, there were 108 meditation caves scattered on the mountain slope, and some of them are still used by the hermits, monks and nuns for meditation retreats today.

Shannan

Lying in Southern Tibet, Shannan, also called Lhoka in Tibetan, is a prefecture-level city bordered by Lhasa to the north, Shigatse to the west, and Nyingchi to the east, with one district and 11 counties, such as Gonggar and Zhanang, under its jurisdiction. The Yarlung Tsangpo River, the mother river of the Tibetan people, flows through Gonggar County and among other counties of Shannan, and the prefecture is thus rich in water resource and contains some holy lakes, such as Yamdrok Lake and Puma Yutso Lake, appearing like glittery jewelry on the plateau. Embraced by snow-capped mountains, Yamdrok Lake, also known as Yamdrok Yumtso, is one of the three largest sacred lakes in Tibet, joining the holy title with Lake Namtso and Lake Manasarovar, situated at an altitude of 4,480 meters and spanning an area of 638 square kilometers. The largest lake in southern Tibet is home to Samding Monastery, which stands on a hill on a peninsula jutting into the lake.

Scenery along the 'sky road': A trip aboard the Qinghai-Tibet train,"For centuries, Tibet has not been explored as much by the outside world due to its remote location, extreme climate and geographic environment. Since the initial launch of the Qinghai-Tibet Railway in 2006, this railway has become the most popular and convenient way to connect Tibet to the rest of China, bringing tremendous profits to the regions. Dubbed the ""sky road"" and noted as a man-made wonder in transportation, the 1,956-kilometer-long world-renowned railway begins in Xining and ends in Lhasa. The stunning scenery along the railway offers not only a feast for the eyes, but also a journey for the soul. Come join CGTN to enjoy the enchanting trip on the Qinghai-Tibet train!

Qinghai Lake: A paradise for birdwatchers and cyclists

Starting from Xining Railway Station, it takes around one hour to appreciate the stunning view of Qinghai Lake. Dazzling like a crystal-clear gem, Qinghai Lake is the largest inland lake as well as saline lake in China. Surrounded by lofty mountains, the lake features two sub-lakes: a saline Gahai Lake and a freshwater Erhai Lake. Be it the blue sky and water, the green grassland or mesmerizing landscapes ¨C Qinghai Lake boasts great charms worth exploring.

Qinghai Lake is definitely a paradise for bird lovers as many different kinds of birds would fly here to breed in May and June due to the mild weather. Meanwhile, for cyclists, cycling around the lake not only allows them to enjoy the beauty of the lake view, but also while away the time.

Tips:

The best time to visit the Qinghai Lake is from April to August as numerous Cole flowers blossom along the lake during that time, forming breathtaking scenery for visitors. In addition, May and June are the best season for bird watching.

Kunlun Mountains: More than just mountains

As the train keeps moving up, a picturesque view of the Kunlun Mountains appears before you. Reputed as the holy mountains, the Kunlun extend west from the Pamirs with a length of 2,500 kilometers. The 6,178-meter-high Yuzhu Peak is the highest of the Kunlun Mountains in Qinghai. The high peaks are covered with snow and mist all year round, creating a stunning view along the Qinghai-Tibet Railway.

It's worth mentioning that Yuzhu Peak is the first sightseeing station for passengers, which allows them to get off the train and take photos outside. It is considered to be an ideal choice for hiking beginners as its route requires less technique.

Hoh Xil Nature Reserve: 'Forbidden zone for humans'

Hoh Xil, which means ""green mountains"" in Mongolian, is a plateau between the Kunlun and Tanggula mountain ranges, with an average altitude of 5,000 meters. Home to many wild animals, including the Tibetan antelope and the wild yak, Hoh Xil Nature Reserve is undoubtedly a desolate region in the northwestern part of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in China.

The extensive area of alpine mountains and steppe systems is situated more than 4,500 meters above sea level, where sub-zero average temperatures prevail all year round. The geographic and harsh climatic conditions have made this place a ""forbidden zone for humans,"" which is also a reason for its biodiversity. This is probably one of the few places left on Earth where one could get off the beaten track and find inner peace.

Tips:

As there are no signs in Hoh Xil Nature Reserve, visitors often get lost here. Remember to bring a local guide with you or rent a car to travel.

Tsonag Lake: A 'soul lake' for Tibetans

Lying in Amdo County, Nagqu Prefecture in the Tibet Autonomous Region, Tsonag Lake is one of the most significant holy lakes to local residents. The Qinghai-Tibet railway passes right by the lake, making it the closest altiplano lake to the railway on the road. Passengers can take photos and capture the charming view of the lake as they would definitely have something to brag about on social media.

The ULTIMATE Chinese Food Tour: Tea and pastries in Yangzhou,"04:54

Fuchun Teahouse is tucked away in an alley in Yangzhou City, east China's Jiangsu Province. It's one of those local treasures that's a bit off the beaten path, but has a reputation big enough to keep customers coming in droves. Established in 1885, the teahouse was simply a flower shop until then owner Chen Buyun introduced a variety of pastries. The place hasn't looked back since.

The teahouse was buzzing on the morning we arrived as people of all ages lined up for a coveted seat inside. At 76 years old, Xu Yongzhen, the national-level inheritor of the Fuchun pastry craft, still has pep in her step as she walks through the teahouse's kitchen and courtyard, and can make pastries with an enviable amount of artistry.

In one of the private dining rooms, I got a firsthand glimpse of the master at work. Xu showed me two of the teahouse's famous dishes: San Ding steamed stuffed buns, or baozi, and thousand-layer cake. Diced chicken, pork and bamboo shoots are sealed in dough, with each perfectly pleated 28 times. The result is a hot and addictive palm-sized baozi. If you're craving something sweet, the thousand-layer cake is your best bet. Xu showed me the secret to creating the dozens of flaky layers: fold the dough, fold it again, and again and again, adding plenty of sugar and oil along the way. The result is a subtly sweet treat topped with candied strips of winter melon.

The ULTIMATE Chinese Food Tour: Fiery Palace stinky tofu in Changsha,"04:47

Inside the red walls of Changsha's Fiery Palace in central China's Hunan Province is one of the unique dishes I've ever tasted or seen made ¨C stinky tofu. The dish dates back to the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) when a local woman began frying discarded tofu in tea oil and stumbled upon a dish that would become a pillar of Hunan's thriving street food culture.

Zhou Houmu, the fourth-generation inheritor of the craft of making Fiery Palace stinky tofu, keeps the tradition near and dear. I met him in the kitchen of the dining area, frying the signature dish. But before dipping the tofu squares into the hot oil, I had to witness the previous steps firsthand. The brine that is used to give the tofu its smell and taste is composed of 20 ingredients, which are mixed and left to ferment for at least a year and a half before use. After that, the concoction can be used over and over again, regularly mixing old and new. According to Zhou, the oldest brine held at the Fiery Palace is 10 years old.

The smell in the brine room is intense, as you can see from my reaction in the video. Fresh tofu squares are soaked in the brine for six hours before removal and rinsing, yet much of the color from the jet-black liquid remains. As I reached my arms into the brine to fish the tofu from the bottom, the smell got even more intense. While I struggled, Zhou said he's become so accustomed to it, he actually likes it now. He also warned me that it would take at least six or seven scrubbings and the rest of the day for the smell to disappear from my arms completely. He was telling the truth. Frying, a key process which requires skill to avoid overcooking, gives the soft tofu a crispy outer layer, and the dish is served with chili sauce and other seasonings. The flow of people eager to get their hands on a bowl is a steady one.

If stinky tofu doesn't interest you, the Fiery Palace is brimming with many other Hunan dishes for every palate. I tried at least 10 and left more than satisfied. The food court is an introduction to Hunan cuisine, and the other restaurants on-site provide some of the finest dishes around made by inheritors. When you plan a trip to the Fiery Palace, come ready to learn about the history of Hunan street food culture, and be sure to come hungry."
The ULTIMATE Chinese Food Tour: Pixian broad bean paste in Chengdu,"05:07

Stepping inside Chengdu's Sichuan Cuisine Museum is an experience. Filled with manicured gardens and ponds, exhibition halls and restaurants, it's like a theme park for all things Sichuan. This is where I found Zhang Anqiu, the provincial-level inheritor of the ""soul of Sichuan cuisine"" ¡ª Pixian broad bean paste. The paste is omnipresent in food here, and without its spicy kick, the true taste of Sichuan would be absent. As the story goes, the creator of the paste, Chen Yixian, moved to Pixian during the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) with beans in tow. The beans molded, and Chen decided to salvage them by drying them in the sun and mixing them with other ingredients. His concoction became a hit and the core of one of China's most popular cuisines. Five simple ingredients are needed: broad beans, chilies, flour, salt and water.

I mirrored Zhang as went through each step of the preparation process, adding each ingredient and mixing them all by hand. He plucked the stem off of each chili with the speed and precision of a machine before washing and chopping them. The final product is fermented in large jars outside on the museum grounds and tended with care by the inheritor, who periodically aerates each one. According to Zhang, some of the paste has been fermenting for as long as 10 years. From fish-flavored shredded pork to mapo tofu, you can taste the finished product in the many food stalls at the museum, which I wasted no time in doing. Only a few miles away, Dandan makes the area's signature condiment on a much larger scale. Stepping inside the facility, you're immediately engulfed in a scent of chilies; it's no doubt the spiciest air I've ever breathed.

A field of large vats holding an estimated 2,000 tons of Pixian broad bean paste fill the massive room. To cover such a large area, the vats are aerated by a small fleet of machines that can handle the volume while keeping the famous paste in peak condition. I was told the paste, still the color of red brick, had been fermenting for around six months at the time of my visit. Impressively, the quality of the broad bean paste is not sacrificed in the scale of the operation. Later, at dinner, while happily filling my stomach with double-cooked pork and kung pao chicken, I could taste the soul of Sichuan in every bite."

Renaissance of Chinese Huangjiu: Good wine does need a bush,"A Huangjiu factory in Shaoxing, east China's Zhejiang Province, May 28, 2021. /CFP A Huangjiu factory in Shaoxing, east China's Zhejiang Province, May 28, 2021. /CFP

A creative ice cream bar made from Chinese Huangjiu, Chinese yellow rice wine, was launched by the Chinese Huangjiu Museum in 2016. Because of low alcoholicity and novel taste, more than 10,000 ice cream bars were sold in the first month of the launch. The ice cream bar can be seen everywhere in Shaoxing, a city famous for Huangjiu in eastern China. Other inventive recipes followed and gained popularity as well. For example, a local restaurant in Shaoxing innovated a pudding with Huangjiu two years ago. On average, about 60 puddings can be sold per day, a considerable quantity for the restaurant.

Pudding with Huangjiu. /Zang He Pudding with Huangjiu. /Zang He

The Huangjiu ice cream bar is the first among the dessert series. Its creator Ruan Shuai, deputy director of the marketing department of the Chinese Huangjiu Museum, was inspired by the ice cream bar of Palace Museum in the shape of representative cultural relics. Inspired by the popularity of the Palace Museum ice cream bar, an idea flashed into Ruan Shuai's mind to add Huangjiu to the ice cream bar. He said this new ice cream bar was not created to earn profit but to let more people know about Chinese Huangjiu and its culture. ""I consider this new kind of ice cream bar as a popular way to spread the culture of Chinese Huangjiu.""

Huangjiu is one of the world's oldest alcoholic drinks, along with beer and wine. The origin of Huangjiu dates back to the Hemudu period (about 5500 to 3300 B.C.). There are many assumptions about the origin. One of them says it might be invented by accident. Back then, the primitives hollowed out the mulberry tree to store leftover rice. Sometimes they forgot the rice and left it in the hollow for a long time. When they took it out, the rice was fermented into a mellow and sweet food, the Huangjiu. Now the commonest alcohol in China is Baijiu, a kind of distilled-liquor rather than fermented. But it was Huangjiu that had accompanied the Chinese people for the longest time. About 3,000 years ago, Chinese people began to make Huangjiu in large quantities. Now it is commonly associated with daily cooking.

In recent decades, the market shares of Huangjiu lag far behind its historical significance. According to statistics released by the China Alcoholic Drinks Association in April 2021, the revenue of Huangjiu in 2020 only accounts for 16.1 percent of the total revenue of alcoholic drinks in China. According to the Report on the Status and Development of Chinese Huangjiu Industry (2021-2027) released by China Industry Research Network, there is a regional imbalance in the consumption of Huangjiu with the sales in three eastern coastal regions (Jiangsu Province, Zhejiang Province and Shanghai) accounting for more than 70 percent of the total amount in China. Huangjiu has been innovated in some other ways. Many people consider Huangjiu as a low-alcohol drink. In fact, the alcoholicity of Huangjiu is 4 to 5 times more than that of beer. Besides, Huangjiu contains fusel and acetaldehyde, which make people get drunk easily. Gu Yue Long Shan, a Huangjiu company in Shaoxing, and Jiangnan University jointly established a laboratory to innovate Huangjiu. After more than three years of research, the laboratory launched a new product that reduces the amount of content in the product that makes consumers tipsy.

China unveils new major discoveries from Sanxingdui Ruins site,"Chinese archaeologists on Thursday unveiled new major discoveries at six newly found sacrificial pits at the Sanxingdui Ruins site in southwest China's Sichuan Province, mostly from pits No. 3, No.4, No. 7 and No. 8. After a period of on-site work, pits No. 7 and No. 8 have been excavated to the utensil layer, where a large amount of ivory fragments were uncovered. The process of excavation at the No. 3 pit has entered the final stage with a new bronze sacred tree unearthed at the pit earlier and most of the cultural relics being cleaned and restored currently.

The much anticipated archaeological excavation of the Sanxingdui Ruins site has been underway, with nearly 10,000 cultural relics dating back about 3,000 years unearthed so far, since the site announced the discovery of six more pits in March.

01:00

In 1986, archaeologists found two large-scale sacrificial pits with thousands of rare ancient treasures at the Sanxingdui Ruins site, which offers great historical evidence of the ancient Shu Kingdom from 5,000 years ago and is considered one of the most important ancient remains in the world.

Rare giant bronze vessels from No. 8 sacrificial pit

Some very rare and important large bronze vessels were uncovered from the No. 8 sacrificial pit during the recent excavation, among which there are likely to be new national treasures. The No. 8 sacrificial pit at the southwestern part of the archaeological site is the largest in size, measuring 5.1 meters in length and 3.8 meters in width. It covers an area of nearly 20 square meters ¨C five times that of pit No. 5. After the archaeological team cleaned up the upper soil-filled and ash layers, a significant number of ivory items were found at the utensil layer, covering almost the entire pit, with some large bronze vessels disclosed in some corners. According to the archaeologists at the site, it could be distinguished from the exposed parts that these bronze items are unique in shape and have never been seen before.

Lots of ivory and jade wares from No. 7 sacrificial pit

A large number of ivory relics were unearthed from the No. 7 sacrificial pit, but no bronze objects have been located underneath the ivory so far, according to archaeologists at the site, who found numerous jade artifacts instead. The archaeologists have discovered jade zhang (jade tablets) and jade zao (chisels), as well as many other types of jade artifacts that have never been seen before.

UK allays fears of campaigners seeking postponement of climate summit,"An influential climate alliance has demanded postponement of the UN Global Climate Change Summit (COP 26) in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic to ensure ""safe, inclusive and just"" negotiations.

Climate Action Network (CAN), an umbrella organization of 1,500 civil society groups spread over 130 countries, said a considerable number of developing countries are reeling under vaccine shortages and struggling to contain the transmission of COVID-19.

Under such circumstances, government officials, delegates, activists and campaigners from these countries may find it difficult to attend the summit, said CAN on Tuesday.

""Our concern is that those countries most deeply affected by the climate crisis and those countries suffering from the lack of support by rich nations in providing vaccines will be left out of the talks and conspicuous in their absence at COP 26,"" said Tasneem Essop, CAN's executive director.

Climate and vaccine equity

In partnership with Italy, the UK will host COP 26 ¨C already delayed by over a year ¨C in Glasgow, Scotland, from October 31 to November 12.

But the host country has placed more than 50 countries on the COVID-19 red list, requiring travelers from these countries to undergo a self-paid 10-day quarantine at a government-specified hotel.

The low-income countries face one of the worst impacts of climate crisis despite having low emissions levels. Now, they struggle to procure COVID-19 vaccines, said CAN.

The organization said the ongoing pandemic and access to vaccines have further deepened the injustice faced by these nations. The organization had demanded vaccine equity and protested the UK's failure to support a patent waiver for the vaccine at the G7 Summit in June.

While 57 percent of the European population is fully vaccinated, the African continent has only been able to vaccinate only three percent of its people, said Essop. ""Our fight for climate justice and our efforts to hold those in power accountable cannot be delinked from the root causes that continue to perpetuate such inequality and injustice.""

'COP 26 must go ahead'

With barely two months left for the climate negotiations to kick off, the UK government issued a statement in response to the demand to postpone the annual summit.

""We are working tirelessly with all our partners, including the Scottish Government and the UN, to ensure an inclusive, accessible and safe summit in Glasgow with a comprehensive set of COVID mitigation measures,"" said Alok Sharma, president-designate of COP 26 on Tuesday.

Sharma also assured campaigners that the government will also provide support for quarantine hotel stays for those attendees arriving from red list countries for the summit. The host will also vaccinate accredited delegates, he said.

""The recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report underlines why COP 26 must go ahead this November to allow world leaders to come together and set out decisive commitments to tackle climate change,"" Sharma said."

The National Museum of China has launched a special mooncake gift box, which can become a paper lantern, creating the perfect atmosphere while moon gazing. It's one of the museum's items created especially for the Mid-Autumn Festival this year, aiming to encourage people to come to the museum and learn more about Chinese culture.

Liao Fei, general manager of the National Museum of China Culinary Culture Ltd., which produced the gift box, told CGTN that the box's design was inspired by a lacquer plate from the Song Dynasty in the museum's collection, and this was then transformed into a six-layered paper lantern. ""Instead of a paper bag, the box was wrapped by a handkerchief on the outside, presented as a lunch box in ancient China style. Each box includes eight classic mooncakes in flavors including lotus and red bean paste. There are mooncakes shaped like a rabbit and persimmon, all with their own auspicious sign,"" he explained. In recent years, museums in China have engaged in market competition with mooncakes carrying unique cultural symbols. It's part of their strategy to revitalize their collection and reach out to younger audiences.

Statistics from Tmall.com, China's largest B2C shopping website, show that purchases by young consumers doubled this year compared to the same period last year, with culturally-inspired products in the lead. The platform said that mooncakes that feature cultural characteristics meet young customers' demand for self-expression. Qi Junsheng, general manager of Tmall Food & Fresh Division told CGTN: ""We see a lot of creativity going into the wrappings and gift boxes of the mooncakes. There's a gramophone where you can record greetings for your friends and family on this special occasion."" Museums overseas have also joined the race. This year, the Louvre Museum in Paris teamed up with H?agen-Dazs China to roll out ice-cream mooncakes themed after masterpieces from the museum's collection, including the Mona Lisa and Venus de Milo. James Chiu, president & managing director of H?agen-Dazs's parent company General Mills China, told CGTN: ""The gift box is not just for the mooncakes, it's a piece of art. Especially amid the lingering COVID-19 crisis, hopefully the mooncake box allows people to get a glimpse of the cultural gems of the Louvre.""



The list of mooncake designs and flavors is getting longer and fancier, but just remember: don't forget to count your calories!"
France withdraws from UK defense talks over Australia submarines row,"France's defense minister has cancelled a high-level meeting with her UK counterpart this week amid a growing diplomatic row after London signed a new security deal with the U.S. and Australia.

The so-called AUKUS deal will build nuclear-powered submarines for Australia. The move means Canberra has pulled out of an existing contract with France, which has angered officials in Paris.

Meanwhile, European Union foreign ministers will discuss the dispute on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly (UNGA) in New York on Monday.

Europe's new Indo-pacific strategy

Florence Parly, who is minister for the French armed forces, was due to meet UK Defense Secretary Ben Wallace in London for two days of talks aimed at strengthening post-Brexit military ties.

UK official Peter Ricketts, who was set to chair the meeting, told the BBC the talks were ""postponed to a later date.""

The announcement of the AUKUS deal last week has led to a strong rebuke from Paris, with President Emmanuel Macron taking the unprecedented step of recalling the country's ambassadors to Washington and Canberra.

France began doubting Australia's commitment to a $40 billion submarine order in June and Macron was only informed by Canberra of the deal's collapse in writing hours before it was announced, a French presidency official said.

The official said there had been no hint of the contract cancellation when Macron met Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison in Paris in mid-June, shortly after a meeting of G7 leaders in the UK.

James Cleverly, a minister at the UK foreign office, said the fallout was part of the ""ups and downs"" in ties between the nations.

""All bilateral relationships go through periods of tension. Ultimately, our relationship with France will endure,"" he told the BBC."
"Desert camel carvings dated to around 7,000 years ago","Life-sized carvings of camels and horses hewn into rock faces in Saudi Arabia could be around 7,000 years old, according to new research that suggests they are significantly older than previously thought.



The 21 reliefs, which were only recently discovered, are heavily eroded and were initially estimated in 2018 to be some 2,000 years old based on similarities with artworks found in Petra in Jordan.



But the new research by Saudi and European institutions used a variety of different methods, including analyzing tool marks and erosion patterns as well as x-ray technology, and suggests the reliefs are around 7,000 to 8,000 years old.



This would mean that the area of carvings, known as the Camel Site, ""is likely home to the oldest surviving large-scale (naturalistic) animal reliefs in the world,"" the study said.



In the era that it was created, the region would have looked very different from the arid landscape of today, with a savannah-like grassland dotted with lakes and trees, where wild camels roamed and were hunted.



""We can now link the Camel Site to a period in prehistory when the pastoral populations of northern Arabia created rock art and built large stone structures called mustatil,"" the authors said in a press release issued by the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History.



""The Camel Site is, therefore, part of a wider pattern of activity where groups frequently came together to establish and mark symbolic places."""

"China to hold culture, tourism expo in Wuhan","The first China (Wuhan) Culture and Tourism Expo will take place in Wuhan, central China's Hubei Province, in November, according to the State Council Information Office during a press briefing in Beijing on Saturday.



The expo will be hosted jointly by the Publicity Department of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, the Ministry of Culture and Tourism, and the Hubei provincial government. It will take place from November 5 to 7, said Guo Yiqiang, deputy secretary-general of the Publicity Department of the CPC Central Committee.



As a major step to drive the high-quality development of China's central region, the Wuhan expo is expected to boost the post-epidemic recovery of the tourism and cultural industry, Guo said.



The expo will feature four main events, including a city promotion event, a forum, a trade and investment conference, and a series of other activities.



China's culture and tourism industry has been recovering and picking up momentum since early this year, said Wang Xiaofeng, an official with the Ministry of Culture and Tourism.



Statistics show that the total revenue of 63,000 large cultural enterprises across the country reached 5.44 trillion yuan ($843 billion) in the first half of 2021, 22 percent higher than the same period in 2019, Wang said.



In the first six months this year, around 1.87 billion domestic trips were made, and the total revenue of the domestic tourism market exceeded 1.6 trillion yuan. Both numbers have gone back to about 60 percent of the level of the same period in 2019, he added."

UK eases international travel rules,"The UK government has announced major changes to its rules for international travel from October 4, opening up more destinations and relaxing testing requirements.

The traffic light system for travel has been simplified, with countries either on a red list, or free of restrictions. The amber list grouping has been scrapped.

Unvaccinated people arriving from amber destinations previously needed to quarantine at home for up to 10 days.

Another key change is that PCR tests will no longer be required for those entering the UK from non-red list countries who have been double-jabbed.

The PCR tests cost around $100 on average and were required on day two after arriving in the country. From October 4 they will be replaced with a simpler and cheaper lateral flow test, which many experts say are less accurate.

The changes will apply to England initially, with Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland setting their own rules on travel and tackling COVID-19.

Red list cut

Before the announcement, there were 62 countries on the red list, which represents the highest level of restrictions. But eight countries have now been moved off it ¨C Turkey, Pakistan, the Maldives, Egypt, Sri Lanka, Oman, Bangladesh and Kenya.

Those coming from countries still on the UK's red list have to go into a government-approved hotel quarantine for up to 11 nights, at a personal cost of $3,150.

Countries classified as red still include popular holiday destinations such as Brazil, South Africa and Thailand.

Friday's changes mean many locations now moving to the green list, where trips are permitted.

Business impact

Businesses in the travel and tourism sector have breathed a sigh of relief at the latest news, but say much more help is needed.

The industry has been battered by the pandemic. In July, the World Travel and Tourism Council told CGTN Europe that 62 million jobs were lost in the sector last year, with more still at risk.

In a further blow to the UK, London's Heathrow Airport has fallen from Europe's busiest before the pandemic to 10th place, as passenger numbers remain subdued.

August was the busiest month for Heathrow since the COVID-19 pandemic swept across the world last year, with 2.2 million travelers passing through it. But those numbers are still down around 70 percent on 2019 levels.

Heathrow CEO John Holland-Kaye said that without bolder action from the government, the country ""will fall further behind [European rivals] as trade and tourists will increasingly bypass the UK.""

Amsterdam's Schiphol was the busiest airport on the continent last month, with 33,590 flights handled there, according to data on its website.

A spokesperson for the UK Department for Transport previously said the UK's policies are ""guided by one overwhelming priority ¨C public health."""
A block of books has its trial phase in Beijing,"Thousands are gathering for the 28th Beijing International Book Fair. But that's not all. The festival is not only attracting readers, but the city is stepping up efforts to provide them with extra nourishment.

Located in the Chinese capital's historic commercial area of Qianmen, Page One is one of the most popular bookstores in Beijing. This massive bookstore stocks hundreds of English-language and art and design books and it's recently expanded to include more categories.

Mr Li, a customer, said of the bookstore: ""Sometimes when you sit here and read books or you look up and see the view of Qianmen, it feels like you are traveling through time. I feel serenity here and it's better to read at a bookstore instead of a coffee house.""

Just a block away at Nanxiaoshun Hutong is Hua Diehui, a bookstore tailored for women that offers weekly seminars and lectures. Xiao Shuying is a clothing bookstore where people can pick up a story about Chinese fashion. Another attraction is a teahouse-themed bookstore called Kungfu Pu'er Tea, where people can have a cup of tea while enjoying a good read.

Integrating bookstores with social life, clothing and tea culture, the ""book"" street is on the trial phase of operation, and the next phase is already under construction, aiming to create a living room full of books and vitality.

For privately operated bookstores, it's still challenging to make a living. Wu Yanping, the managing partner of the bookstore One Way Space, said the bookstore has struggled to stay afloat in a challenging economy and he decided to diversify to attract people.

From chain bookstores to creative 'book' street to traditional private bookstore, bookstore owners in Beijing are racking their brains to win back customers to the printed word."
'Worn Out' ¨C Dutch museum finds Van Gogh drawing of tired old man,"A Dutch museum on Thursday unveiled a previously unknown work by Vincent van Gogh ¨C a study for one of his best-known drawings, ""Worn Out"" ¨C in which an old man sits in a chair with his head in his hands. Van Gogh ""was really interested in the ordinary person, he was also looking to express emotion,"" said Van Gogh Museum Director Emilie Gordenker. ""I think we're all coming out of the COVID-19 period feeling like this and the amazing thing is that we can share this with our visitors. We're open, we're delighted to be open.""

Discoveries of works by the famously troubled artist, who died in 1890, are extremely rare. The drawing is owned by a private collector and had never been known of or displayed.

""So when (the owner) came to the museum it was a big surprise,"" said Senior Researcher Teio Meenendorp, adding that the piece was relatively easy to authenticate. The 50 x 30 cm (20 x 12 inch) work was done with Van Gogh's favorite drawing tool, a carpenter's pencil, in his distinctive style, on watermarked paper from 1877. It closely resembles the more famous ""Old Man"" drawing, but the perspective is at eye-level with the old man, rather than from above. The work can be dated with unusual precision to the last weeks of November 1882, Meenendorp said, because of two letters Van Gogh wrote on November 24 of that year. It was a period of relative stability for the artist while he was living with a woman in The Hague.

One letter was to his brother Theo, saying he had made two drawings of ""an old man with his elbows on his knees and his head in his hands"" and that he was thinking of making it into a lithograph.

""What a fine sight an old working man makes, in his patched bombazine suit with his bald head,"" Vincent wrote. The other letter was to a fellow artist, saying with confidence he planned to make a lithograph of the theme. Van Gogh did make the lithograph, titled ""At Eternity's Gate"", three days later, on November 27, 1882.

Meenendorp said Van Gogh had given the works English titles partly in hopes his drawings might be noticed and lead to a job for him as an illustrator for a magazine. That never happened. Van Gogh had little commercial success while he was alive, though he won great acclaim later. The Dutch artist was troubled by mental illness and considered himself a failure. He returned to the theme with an oil painting known as ""Sorrowing Old Man"", based on the lithograph, two months before his own death. Van Gogh died on July 29, 1890, of a self-inflicted gun wound.

""In Paris, Christo and Jeanne-Claude dreamed of packing the Arc de Triomphe. Today, this project is coming to life,"" said Hidalgo on Twitter.

Imagined in 1961 by the late Bulgarian-born artist Christo, ""L'Arc de Triomphe, Wrapped"" was finally brought to life by Christo's nephew, Vladimir Yavatchev, at a cost of about 14 million euros ($16.54 million).

Christo, whose full name was Christo Vladimirov Javacheff, was known for his larger-than-life installations. The renowned artist died of natural causes at his home in New York City in late May last year.

East China Sea 101: The bird with feathers that have metallic gloss,"A birdwatcher spotted a species with glossy feathers in a wetland park in Quanzhou City, southeast China's Fujian Province, on August 25, 2021, exciting many bird lovers on social media platforms. The bird was a glossy ibis, and this was only the second appearance this year for the species in the province.

The glossy ibis is a water bird with distinctive metallic glossy feathers. It inhabits wetlands, margins of lakes and rivers, and is also found in wet meadows, swamps and ponds. Though it is a ""Least Concern"" species on the IUCN Red List, due to wetland degradation and loss, the population is still declining in some areas.

In China, the bird is under first-class state protection. It has been spotted in places including Zhejiang, Yunnan, Guangdong and Fujian provinces, with only a small number of one or two. It was once considered to be extinct in China, but has reappeared since 2009 due to the improved environment.

South African Airways (SAA) is set to return to the skies on September 23, but the airline has expressed concern, indicating that it might be an uphill task to get stakeholders, including the passengers, to regain trust in the carrier.

The national carrier will resume flights after 16 months of being grounded due to viability challenges, despite repeated government bailouts and implementation of business rescue plan.

The operational failure of the SAA has allegedly been caused by corruption, and the inescapable impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Resumption of flights comes three months after the government ceded part of its airline stake to Takatso Consortium, who are now the majority shareholders with a 51 percent stake.

The airline's interim chief executive officer Thomas Kgokolo said that winning back the stakeholders' trust would ""take time.""

However, he expressed great optimism in the airline's team's ability to turn things around, saying that ""with the confidence and the enthusiasm our staff are showing ahead of our take off, I'm confident we will achieve the set goals quickly.""

Egypt on Tuesday reopened to tourists the 4,700-year-old southern tomb of King Djoser at the pyramid of Saqqara, south of Cairo, after a 15-year renovation.

Inscribed on UNESCO's World Heritage List, the tomb lies near the Third Dynasty pharaoh's famous Step Pyramid, Egypt's earliest large-scale stone structure, which itself was closed for restoration until March 2020.

The southern tomb, built between 2667 B.C. and 2648 B.C., is thought to have been built for symbolic reasons, or perhaps to hold Djoser's internal organs, said Mostafa Waziri, secretary-general of Egypt's Supreme Council of Antiquities."

Broadway celebrated the return of some of its biggest musicals on Tuesday after an 18-month COVID-19 shutdown, a landmark moment in New York's post-pandemic recovery. ""Hamilton,"" ""Wicked,"" ""The Lion King"" and ""Chicago"" were all resuming performances, to the delight, and relief, of the industry and theater lovers.

""Broadway is back and it's a fun thing for everybody,"" said Jenni Milanoski, who traveled with her daughter from Boston, hoping to see ""Hamilton.""

Broadway theaters have been gradually reopening throughout September but Tuesday heralds the collective return of some of its most popular shows. September 14 was the date former Governor Andrew Cuomo said Broadway would reopen back in May.

All audiences are required to be vaccinated, as are performers, backstage crew and theater staff, while spectators must also wear masks throughout the show. Theater fans said they felt safe returning to indoor performances knowing that everybody was vaccinated despite concerns about the highly infectious Delta variant.

Broadway generated around $33 million in sales per week across 31 shows before COVID-19 swept the Big Apple in March 2020, forcing the abrupt shutdown that left thousands in the industry suddenly without work. The pandemic has killed 34,000 people in New York City. The resumption of shows comes with the city still suffering a huge shortfall in tourists, which typically make up two-thirds of audiences. But officials and theaters are confident that New Yorkers, and those who can visit, are desperate to watch live theater again.

Citing this year's survey data from 8,313 overseas residents representing more than 160 nationalities and working in 175 destinations worldwide, the organization has found that the group comprises mostly well-educated people, of whom 80 percent are university graduates. Over half hold advanced degrees, while others are white-collar workers in mid- to senior-level positions.

According to InterNations, about a third of the respondents employed overseas earn an annual income ranging from $50,000 to $100,000, with the most common industries being education, IT and finance. Other sectors include manufacturing and engineering, healthcare, advertising, marketing and communications.

What changed during COVID-19?

Many people have had to change their plans during the pandemic, with disruptions to personal travel and social life being the biggest concerns for working expats, said Stephanie Anko-Hubik, the media spokesperson for InterNations.

""Personal concerns clearly outweigh economic or financial ones,"" Anko-Hubik told CGTN. However, she acknowledged that the figures might exclude people who have already moved home or are unemployed due to COVID-19.

About one in five of those who have returned home from a stay abroad said that they returned earlier than originally intended due to reasons related to COVID-19. Over 60 percent of the returnees cited personal reasons, including wanting to be closer to family and social isolation abroad. Meanwhile, 46 percent also planned to return to their life abroad within the year.

The survey also showed that an overwhelming 77 percent of local respondents who had to put their relocation plans on hold at this time said they still want to move abroad within the next two years."

Restored silk fabrics from Sanxingdui Ruins unveiled for first time,"02:11

Using modern technology, Chinese archaeologists and researchers have restored silk fabrics from the Sanxingdui Ruins site in southwest China's Sichuan Province and unveiled them for the first time. What appeared to be ash on the surfaces of gold masks, bronze wares and other artifacts uncovered at the site turned out to be silk, according to China's cultural authorities. This is the first time silk and textile residue has been unearthed at the Sanxingdui Ruins, and the discovery advances the origin of silk in the Sichuan Basin to over 3,000 years ago, according to the archaeologists. The new findings indicate the ancient Shu Kingdom was one of the important origins of silk in ancient China, shedding light on the unified yet diverse origins of Chinese civilization.

After over half a year of research, crew members from the China National Silk Museum and Sichuan Provincial Cultural Relics and Archaeology Research Institute found that there were mainly three types of fabric.

""We found three types of fabrics at the Sanxingdui Ruins site this time, namely Juan, Qi and braided fabric,"" said Long Bo, an associate research fellow at the China National Silk Museum.

Sacrificial objects with spiritual meaning

The researchers discovered the fabric found in the No. 8 pit was juan (tough silk) after restoring it on a computer, but the exact color is very hard to identify due to erosion. Researchers at the China National Silk Museum used white and black pieces of paper to better show the structure of juan, and even illustrated how to produce it on site.

Zhou Yang, a research fellow at the museum said that silk was first used in sacrificial objects, and it was later used in tombs, as well as in ordinary people's daily clothing. The silk fabrics found at the Sanxingdui Ruins recently are sacrificial objects.

""The silk found in this sacrificial burial pit bears even more spiritual meaning, because we know that that scenario is for connecting heaven and earth, and connecting human and god, which has a certain religious meaning. So the silk found here is obviously different from those discovered in tombs or ruins,"" said Zhou.

Shedding light on the origin of Shu brocade

The discovery of silk fabrics at the Sanxingdui Ruins is of great significance to the historical research of the Sichuan silk, one of China's most famous brocades also known as Shu brocade (Shujin), and of the silk of Central Plains, according to Zhou. ""This time, through more cutting-edge scientific cognition methods, we found the existence of silk, and filled the vacancy of silk in the Sichuan Basin with archaeological evidence,"" noted Zhou.

On the basis of the new findings, the history of silk in the Sichuan Basin can be dated back to the Sanxingdui period, about 3,000 years ago during the Shang Dynasty (1600-1100 B.C.).

No quarantine for vaccinated tourists traveling to Bangkok in October,"A Yaksha demon statue is seen wearing a face mask in the terminal at Suvarnabhumi Airport (BKK) in Bangkok, Thailand, September 5, 2021. /CFP A Yaksha demon statue is seen wearing a face mask in the terminal at Suvarnabhumi Airport (BKK) in Bangkok, Thailand, September 5, 2021. /CFP

Thailand plans to reopen Bangkok to fully vaccinated visitors in October, officials said on Friday, as the kingdom seeks to salvage a tourism industry hammered by the COVID-19 pandemic. Tourism made up a fifth of Thailand's national income in 2019 but severe travel curbs imposed to fight the virus saw the usual flood of foreign visitors dwindle to almost nothing, contributing to the economy's worst performance in over 20 years. The kingdom is pressing ahead with plans to reopen despite a deadly third wave of infections, driven by the Delta variant.

The Tourism Authority of Thailand said that from October 1, fully vaccinated foreign travellers will be able to visit Bangkok and four other provinces without undergoing two weeks' hotel quarantine. Instead, the five areas ¨C also including Chiang Mai, Chon Buri, Phetchaburi and Prachuap Khiri Khan provinces ¨C are expected to follow a ""sandbox"" model of the type piloted since July in the holiday island of Phuket. Under the Sandbox scheme, tourists have to stay within a certain area for seven days after arrival and take COVID-19 tests.

Later in October, 21 more destinations will be added to the list including Chiang Rai, Sukhothai and popular seaside getaway Rayong. But Thailand's third and deadliest COVID-19 wave has not yet fully subsided, and the tourism agency warned the plans could change. Thailand got through 2020 relatively unscathed by COVID-19, recording low numbers of infections, but since April, the Delta variant has taken hold and cases have soared to more than 1.3 million, with almost 14,000 deaths. More than 29,000 fully vaccinated international visitors hit the beach at Phuket under its Sandbox scheme (since July), generating nearly $50 million dollars in revenue according to government spokesman Thanakorn Wangboonkongchana. Three more Thai islands also reopened ¨C Samui, Tao and Phangan ¨C with slightly more onerous restrictions. One cloud hanging over Thailand's tourism revival plans is the travel advice of other countries discouraging would-be tourists from visiting. Britain and the United States have warned against travel to Thailand because of rising case numbers and low vaccination rates. About 16 percent of the Thai population have received two coronavirus vaccine doses, the government's COVID-19 task force said.

An axe-shaped gold ware is found at the No. 5 sacrificial pit of the Sanxingdui Ruins site in southwest China's Sichuan Province. /CMG

An axe-shaped piece of gold ware has been found at the No. 5 sacrificial pit of the Sanxingdui Ruins site in southwest China's Sichuan Province amid the ongoing excavation at the 3,000-year-old treasure house.

Among the six new sacrificial pits found in March, pit No. 5, though the smallest in size, contains the largest number of gold pieces.

The newfound item is likely to be the next most important gold artifact found from the pit after the half-face gold mask which was unearthed in March, according to Li Haichao, an archaeologist in charge of the pit.

Currently, 7 centimeters in length is exposed. Its shape resembles an axe with a curved blade in the front and three grooves on the surface. It has not yet been confirmed whether the piece is actually an axe or an ornament belonging to another artifact.

What has surprised the archaeologists is its thickness. Other gold artifacts found in the same pit are around 1 millimeter thick, but this one is about three millimeters thick."
East China Sea 101: The rare bird with special 'hairstyle' in Fujian,"This March, in the Jian'ou City of southeast China's Fujian Province, bird-watchers spotted a type of bird with a special ""hairstyle"", as the elongated feather on the back of the head looks like large peacock feathers on the headwear of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) officials.

The bird is called Chinese merganser. It is an endangered species on the IUCN Red List and a first-class state protected bird in China. According to experts, this is the first time Chinese mergansers are spotted in the area, marking the region's good environment.

The Chinese merganser is a migratory bird. It breeds in northern forests, and spends winter in southern areas including China, Japan and Thailand. Due to vegetation destruction, water pollution and habitat loss, the population of the bird declined rapidly in the 1960s and 70s.

As it has a high requirement for habitat environment, the bird's presence has become an indication of the ecological excellence of the local environment. Therefore, the news of spotting the birds resting in Jian'ou City excited many experts and birdlovers.

Large bronze mask unearthed at Sanxingdui ruins,"A large bronze mask was discovered from pit No. 3 of the Sanxingdui ruins in southwest China's Sichuan Province on Thursday, it's relatively well preserved, and more complete than other relics discovered so far in the ruins.

""It can be regarded as the largest bronze mask unearthed in Sanxingdui, and possibly the largest in the Shang (1600-1100 B.C.) and the Zhou dynasties (1100-221 B.C.),"" according to archaeologist Xu Feihong, who is the person-in-charge of the archaeological work in Sanxingdui's No.3 ritual pit.

""The widest part, from one tip of the ear to the other, is 136 centimeters and the height is roughly 75 centimeters,"" said Xu. It was unearthed from the central part of the No.3 pit, the mask is with complicated burial conditions.

Since six more pits were found in March, the widely anticipated archaeological excavation of the Sanxingdui Ruins site has been proceeding, yielding approximately 10,000 cultural relics dating back over 3,000 years, according to the Sichuan Provincial Cultural Relics and Archaeology Research Institute."

China issues directive to ensure efficient heritage protection systems,"New guidelines have been announced in China that call for efforts to build scientifically designed heritage protection systems in both urban and rural regions, according to the State Council.

The new rules state clearly that scientifically defined, well protected and efficiently managed systems for the preservation and inheritance of urban and rural history must be developed, Yang Baojun, chief economist at the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development, said during a state council press conference on Wednesday.



Different kinds of historical and cultural heritage need to be well protected, Yang said. Places like historical cities, old towns, traditional villages, time-honored blocks, immovable cultural relics, irrigation engineering heritage all need to be preserved as a whole. A management system for the protection and inheritance needs to be established, Yang added.



The State Council has announced a total of 137 national historical and cultural cities so far, said Huang Yan, the vice minister of housing and urban-rural development.

""Together with the State Administration of Cultural Heritage, we have announced 312 historical and cultural towns and 487 historical and cultural villages, and placed 6,819 villages on the list of traditional Chinese villages under protection, forming the world's largest heritage group of agricultural civilization,"" Huang said."

Performers, directors, viewers and visitors are descending on Wuzhen, an ancient water town in east China's Zhejiang Province, to exchange ideas, share inspirations and celebrate arts during the 10-day festival.

The event, one of the premier festivals in Asia, is in its eighth edition this year, offering a wider selection of shows for theater lovers and performing arts enthusiasts, with a total of 24 productions featuring 66 performances as well as a series of forums and workshops.

The appealing lineup includes award-winning playwright Stan Lai's new piece ""Ago,"" a remake of French classic ""Le Rouge et le Noir"" (""The Red and the Black"") by Meng Jinghui Theatre Studio, ""Reflection"" by Xiexin Dance Theater, as well as a Tibetan language version of ""Hamlet"" helmed by renowned veteran theatrical actor Pu Cunxin."
East China Sea 101: Vulnerable pink 'elves',"The East China Sea is home to many rare species, including the Chinese white dolphin, which is often referred to as the ""pink elf in the sea"" or the ""giant panda of the sea.""

Chinese white dolphin has pink skin because of overdeveloped blood vessels. It is listed as ""vulnerable"" on the IUCN Red List, as it has been threatened by problems including habitat loss, water pollution and overfishing. In China, the mammal is under first-class state protection, and due to marine protection efforts, it has been spotted more frequently in these years.

Fishermen in Fujian Province, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and Taiwan region honor the dolphin as Goddess Matsu's fish, therefore seeing them playing in water is considered lucky. From 2017, the mammal has been spotted in many parts of Fujian Province, including Quanzhou Bay, Ningde City, Xianmen City and Fuding City. An expert from the Peking University's School of Life Sciences said the Chinese white dolphins are sensitive to water quality, and an increase in their number is reflective of an improvement in marine environment.

Excavation work involving the ancient tomb cluster was conducted between June and July, during which 11 tombs and one building site were found in the area.

Based on the shape of the tombs, features of the unearthed objects and inscriptions on the bricks, archaeologists inferred that the tombs were built from the Han Dynasty (202 BC-220 AD) to the Tang Dynasty (618-907), and the building site was constructed in the Eastern Han Dynasty (25-220), according to Chen Bin, head of the archaeological project.

Egypt's Minister of Transportation Kamel al-Wazir said that the new train will transport passengers and goods by connecting Ain Sokhna at the Red Sea with Matrouh at the Mediterranean Sea, passing through the new administrative capital, Helwan, 6th of October City, Alexandria, Borg Al-Arab, and Alamein city.

The consortium would carry out all the project systems including signals, communications and electro-mechanics and design carriages and maintenance workshops, he added.

Noting that ""the contract would be enforced as of today,"" the minister said that Siemens company will provide continuous support for strengthening local workers' capabilities."

The UK has denied reports it pushed for a gate to be left open at Kabul Airport last week hours before a deadly suicide attack at the facility.

A report by Politico claims U.S. forces left the Abbey Gate open longer than they wanted to, to allow British personnel to speed up their evacuation efforts.

The gate was where a suicide bomber killed at least 170 civilians and 13 American troops last Thursday.

Special report: How conflict drives poverty

Speaking to Sky News, UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, who has faced strong criticism over his handling of the Afghanistan crisis, said it was ""just not true ... that we were pushing to leave the gate open.""

Prime Minister Boris Johnson's office put out a similar statement on Tuesday denying the reports as British officials seek to distance themselves from the claims.

UK nationals left behind

Like many Western nations involved in the 20-year Afghan war, the UK has been scrambling to evacuate thousands of its citizens and Afghan staff since mid-August.

Raab said more than 17,000 people had been taken out of Afghanistan but that some British nationals were left behind. He put the figure in the ""low hundreds,"" according to the BBC.

Many of those are understood to be larger families, or those without the correct documentation.

But there are fears about the fate of those still in the country as the U.S. withdrew its final soldiers late on Monday.

Taliban spokesman Suhail Shaheen tweeted to say Afghanistan had ""gained full independence"" following the departures.

But millions of people in the country and outside remain worried about what the future holds for a nation that has suffered more than four decades of conflict.

Many global powers are still weighing up how to deal with the Taliban, which after 20 years of war seems in a stronger position than it was before the U.S. invasion.

Johnson's spokesman said it was ""too early to dictate if and how we would work with the Taliban going forward.""

""A lot will depend on their actions from now,"" he added.

Aside from the political uncertainty, the United Nations has warned that Afghanistan is facing a humanitarian crisis and possible famine.

The events of the past few weeks have forced thousands to try to leave the country and severely damaged the Afghan economy, leading to long queues at banks and doubts about the Taliban's ability to access foreign reserves."

Tianti Mountain Grottoes are located in northwest China's Gansu Province and boast a history of 1,600 years. /CFP

The restoration of the feet of a 1,600-year-old stone Buddha in Tianti Mountain Grottoes has been completed.

The Buddha statue of the site's No.13 grotto in northwest China's Gansu Province was built on fragile red sandstone beside a reservoir. Years of water seepage and weathering damaged parts of the statue, including the feet.

The restoration project was launched in May 2020 by Dunhuang Academy, a national research institute established to protect the renowned UNESCO world heritage site of the Mogao Caves.

The most difficult part to repair was the feet, which had suffered severe water damage, Qiao Hai from the Dunhuang Academy said.

Workers drained water from the floor and rocks surrounding the stone Buddha, removed loose rock chunks, figured out the original size and features of the badly damaged feet, and brought it back to its former glory, according to Qiao.

The project can help protect the foundation of the historic statue and restore its overall integrity, Qiao said.

Some of China's oldest, the Tianti Mountain Grottoes are often referred to as the ""ancestor of grottoes"" in the Chinese academic world. The grottoes were first built in the Eastern Jin Dynasty (317-420) and are under state-level protection."

The United Arab Emirates (UAE) announced it will resume issuing visas to all fully vaccinated tourists from August 30, a month before Dubai hosts the delayed Expo 2020 trade fair.

The move comes amid a drop in COVID-19 cases in the oil-rich Gulf country, after it reported less than 1,000 cases per day last week for the first time in months.

According to a statement by UAE's National Authority for Emergency, Crisis and Disaster Management and the Federal Authority for Identity and Citizenship, the decision to open up visit visa applications for fully vaccinated tourists was ""in line with the UAE's strategy to strike a balance between the interests of public health and sustainable economic recovery.""

Those eligible would have to be fully inoculated with one of the COVID-19 vaccines approved by the World Health Organization, which include AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson, Moderna, Pfizer-BioNTech, Sinopharm and Sinovac.

""The decision applies to citizens of all countries, including those arriving from previously banned countries,"" the official WAM news agency said.

Vibrant Xinjiang: The desert vineyards of Turpan,"04:28

The city of Turpan in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region is also known by its Chinese nickname ""Huo Zhou,"" literally meaning ""a place as hot as fire,"" due to its reputation as the hottest city of China. The city is home to the fabled Flaming Mountains ¨C the barren red sandstone hills in the Tianshan Mountain range ¨C where the summer temperatures frequently reach 50¡ã Celsius and above. Surrounded by the Taklamakan Desert, Turpan is located about 150 kilometers southeast of Urumqi in a mountain basin, on the northern side of the Turpan Depression, that lies some 150 meters below sea level. The unique geographic and climatic conditions are perhaps the main reasons why Turpan has emerged as China's largest grape growing area and gradually making its way to becoming a key wine-producing hub. The lush green orchards and vineyards, enclosed within a rugged and arid desert terrain, are a sight to cherish. With Tianshan Mountains as the backdrop, the foreground of Turpan Basin is dotted with ""chunches,"" the Uygur word for the compact buildings where grapes are dried and made raisins. During a recent visit to the Grape Valley in Turpan, a team from CGTN Digital got a peek into Turpan's centuries-old vineyards and wine-making industry that have lately become a big draw for both domestic and international travelers. A 2,300-year-old wine history It is believed that Chinese official and diplomat by the name of Zhang Qian from the 2nd century BC was on a mission to the western regions, when he discovered that people in Turpan grew grapes and produced wine. ""We have been brewing wine in Turpan for at least 2,300 years. Presently, there are 67 large and small wineries in Turpan. Loulan Winery is quite famous and has an annual production worth over 100 million yuan,"" Zhang Mingming, deputy general manager of Xinjiang Cultural Tourism Company, Turpan Branch, told CGTN Digital.

The grapes from Turpan are relatively richer in sugar and therefore suitable for making sweet wine. While August is the main harvest season for grapes here, the early-ripening varieties of the fruit mature at the end of June and a few varieties grown in greenhouses mature even earlier, around March. ""However, the grapes used to make wine mature relatively late, usually from the end of September to October. We use a very ancient and primitive method to make wine,"" Zhang elucidated. Turpan grows over a dozen types of grapes, and the water needed to nourish the grape vines is brought via an ancient irrigation system called ""karez,"" meaning ""well"" in the Uygur language. BRI brings new opportunities With Xinjiang being developed as the gateway to China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), Turpan has witnessed transformative growth in recent years. It now takes less than an hour to cover the 150-kilometer distance between Turpan and capital Urumqi via the Lanzhou-Xinjiang High-Speed Railway that opened in 2014, connecting Xinjiang to neighboring Gansu Province. Zhang felt that the BRI brings new opportunities for the development of Turpan's wine industry. ""Turpan was an important township on the ancient Silk Road, an important node, our good wines can be sold abroad through the Belt and Road Initiative. At the same time, the advanced wine-making skills from abroad can be shared in Turpan as well."" Ethnic groups in wine industry Xinjiang is home to scores of diverse ethnic groups and according to the official the wine industry creates opportunities for all communities. ""Local ethnic groups are very open to making and selling wine. They are involved in the whole process of making and selling wine, and even as end consumers,"" Zhang said. He however conceded that ""while some people from the older generation of Muslims may have certain reservations about wine, the younger generation do not have such taboos. ""The younger generation, such as those born in 80s, 90s and 2000s, are very open. And these young consumers are from the Hui, Uygur and other local ethnic minorities. Wine tasting at Western Wine Castle

02:17

CGTN reporters were also offered wine tasting at the Western Wine Castle, which started operation in 2000 from a location inside the Grape Valley. It essentially produces home-brewed wines. ""Our wine cellar is dug inside the Flaming Mountains. It is the only one in the country to be located at such a place. Here we mainly produce whole-juice wine,"" Zhang said. Gulhasal Sattar, the lovely Uygur bartender, served from the wine collection that has developed its own reputation among the regular visitors. ""We produce three kinds of wines: whole juice (sweet red) wine, dry red wine and dry white wine, as well as some grape juice ... The most important feature of Turpan wine is its high sugar content. In particular, the quality of dry red wine is very high. Our root series is especially good because the vineyard is considered to be very pure,"" the official said. ""Our winery sells about 10,000 bottles of wine a year. Our winery currently employs 22 people in the scenic area,"" he informed. While the Western Wine Castle caters to domestic and international tourists arriving at Turpan's Grape Valley, it is still exploring the potential of exporting wines. Tourists can try our wine collection especially at our night bar, but we haven't yet exported to foreign wineries,"" Zhang said. ""The price for our wine ranges from 60 to 300 yuan per bottle,"" he added. Aided by the BRI vision, the wines from the desert vineyards of Turpan are slowly and gradually making inroads into the international market. However, for now, to get the most authentic feel, one needs to travel to China's hottest city to taste the ""coolest"" local wine.

Ruins of ancient Shu civilization excavated in China's Chengdu,"Chinese archaeologists have discovered ruins dating back to the Western Zhou Dynasty (1046-771 BC) and the Spring and Autumn Period (770-476 BC) in southwestern China.



The ruins site in Chengdu, capital of southwest China's Sichuan Province, was discovered during the refurbishment of a primary school, the Sichuan Provincial Cultural Relics and Archeology Research Institute said on Wednesday.



Over 80 tombs, 10 building sites and more than 60 ash pits from the Western Zhou Dynasty and the Spring and Autumn Period have been unearthed, with a large number of bronzes, jades and pieces of pottery among the artifacts, including willow-shaped swords and seals.



The cemetery was arranged in an orderly manner, indicating the site was carefully planned, the institute said.



The discovery is regarded as of great significance for the study of Shu funeral and etiquette systems on the Chengdu Plain.

The ruins site could be traced back to the transition from the early Shu culture represented by the Sanxingdui and Jinsha sites to later times. It provides important materials for archaeologists to explore the ancient Shu civilization, according to Xiong Qiaoqiao, director of the excavation site."
Genting Dream ¨C Hong Kong's first 'cruise to nowhere',"China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) has launched its first ever ""cruise to nowhere.""



The Genting Dream will sail out to sea past the Lei Yue Mun and Tathong channels before entering international waters and returning along the same route.



Each voyage will take 3 to 4 days, but unlike other typical cruise trips, this ship won't stop at any ports of call. That's just one of many health measures it's taken to keep any coronavirus outbreaks at bay.



All passengers and crew must be fully vaccinated and tested for the virus before departure.



Face masks are also required at all times on board the ship, aside from dining and water sports.



The cruise has further implemented its own contact tracing system, requiring passengers to carry a tracking device wherever they go. Anyone within 1.5 meters of an infected person for over 15 minutes counts is a close contact, so the device encourages social distancing.

And while cruises traditionally rely on mixing fresh air with recirculated air for indoor ventilation, rooms on the Genting Dream, including cabins, each have independent ventilation systems that provide 100 percent fresh air.



For example, for cabins, incoming fresh air gets filtered into the room from one vent and gets redirected out of the ship, through another vent in the bathroom, to avoid air recirculation between cabins.



This ship has always had this ventilation system, but other cruises have been working on improving theirs, following last year's spreader events on such ships as the Diamond Princess.



And in keeping with government regulations, the Genting Dream is now operating at half passenger capacity.

The Genting Dream's waterslide park offers six slides with different levels of ""difficulty."" /CGTN The Genting Dream's waterslide park offers six slides with different levels of ""difficulty."" /CGTN

""We spent a lot of effort on hygiene and sanitization. Of course, that costs more labor,"" said Christine Li, senior vice president and head of marketing at Dream Cruises. ""Now on this cruise, we have 1,100 crew, and we also have 1,500 passengers today, so it's almost 1 to 1. It used to be, I think, 1 to 2, so we increased the crew number.""



Meanwhile, isolated wards in the medical center and cabins can also be converted into quarantine rooms in case someone gets infected with the coronavirus.



""I'm not scared of the virus. I've been vaccinated and tested. If I still get infected, I can only say I'm unlucky. But I believe the government has done quite a good job on this so I trust the government,"" said one passenger.



With 19 decks and weighing over 150,000 tonnes, the Genting Dream has a wide range of outdoor attractions to offer, including a ropes course that has a 35-meter zipline. Other activities include rock climbing, outdoor yoga, and a waterslide park with six different slides. Otherwise, retail therapy is available for those looking to splurge, and there are 20 restaurants and bars for others to have their fill.



People were generally excited to be on board. One female passenger said she was looking forward to relaxing with her family and friends, while another guest expressed happiness over being able to travel again.

""Actually, for the summer holiday, [it] has been a robust month for us. The traditional low season is after school holiday[s] ¨C it's September and October, but we see a very good pickup in the low season as well,"" said Li, the passenger.



Li added that the cruise is looking forward to a wider variety of itineraries, especially involving south China's Greater Bay Area, when borders open up.



Cruises in the HKSAR have been suspended since last February, and Genting Cruise Lines is currently the only operator of such a voyage.



The SAR government says this ""cruise to nowhere"" is a good start for the city's struggling tourism sector and a step toward normalcy."

According to Tom Mehrmann, UBR's president and general manager, the resort's rides, entertainment facilities, and performances will run at a reduced capacity during the trial phase. ""So rides and shows may open and close based on what we are learning and hearing from guests, so we can make adjustments. That's what happens during internal pressure testing,"" noted Mehrmann. In addition, all invited visitors must upload their personal information in advance, and they must also have a temperature check and present a valid digital health code before entering the resort.

Saihanba: The 'green miracle' created by three generations in N China,"On August 24, 2021, Chinese President Xi Jinping inspected Saihanba Forest Farm in north China's Hebei Province. Saihanba is considered to be a miracle as it has been transformed from barren land to lush forest through the extraordinary efforts of three generations of Chinese people.

President Xi Jinping inspects Saihanba Forest Farm in north China's Hebei Province. /Screenshot from CCTV News President Xi Jinping inspects Saihanba Forest Farm in north China's Hebei Province. /Screenshot from CCTV News

Saihanba was previously been home to abundant forest resources and high biodiversity 400 years ago. With a cool summer and lush vegetation, the area was set to be a royal retreat. However, deforestation and constant wars turned the area into a desert by the end of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911). As the forest barrier was gone, sandstorms became more frequent. To stop sandstorms that kept threatening or event striking Beijing, Tianjin and other northern China cities, the Forestry Administration decided in 1962 to set the Saihanba Mechanical Forest Farm, and sent 369 foresters, mostly in their 20s, to the area for tree planting.

The first group of foresters in Saihanba faced many challenges, equipped with only the simplest tools amid extreme coldness and drought. As result, they were unable to ensure the survival of trees planted. However, after the joint efforts of three generations, Saihanba was restored and turned back into a green paradise with a forest coverage raised from 11.4 percent to 80 percent, which can conserve and purify 137 million cubic meters of water every year.

The miraculous planting story of foresters in Saihanba gives rise to the concept of the Saihanba Spirit, defined as working hard, advancing against difficulties, forging ahead, and innovating boldly. As one of the largest man-made plantations in the world, the Saihanba Afforestation Community won the honor of Champions of the Earth in 2017 due to the efforts to transform degraded land into a green paradise. Now, the lush Saihanba has become home to thousands of species of flora and fauna for its good environment, and also attracts numerous tourists.

Afghans in UK worry about nation's future after Taliban takeover,"As the world scrambles to react to the Taliban's takeover of Afghanistan, millions of Afghans outside the country are watching events closely.

One of the largest diaspora communities is in the UK, where many are worried about what comes next for a nation that has seen more than four decades of conflict.

Many Afghans still have family in their home country, including Qari Abdul Wakil.

Along with his family, he fled the Afghan Civil War in 1991 and went to Pakistan before making it to London in 1996. Today, he heads a mosque and community center in the suburb of Hounslow, one of a few areas in the UK capital with a large Afghan community.

""We don't want this war to continue any longer,"" he told me, inside the prayer room at the Islamic Integration Community Centre (IICC), which he founded in 2008.

Today, it's a hub for Afghans across the capital, where it hosts events that many still hold dear, like weekly Friday prayers and Islamic marriages and funerals.

""In my lifetime, I've witnessed 45 years of fighting in Afghanistan. Nobody is happy to leave their country. All this fighting has forced us to escape. But the love we feel for our country is in everyone's hearts. It's not like we've forgotten our nation,"" he adds.

It's not just older Afghans who are concerned about the latest developments.

24-year-old Yusuf Ibrahimi works at the IICC and has been receiving calls from worried residents seeking help in Afghanistan: ""I think all the Afghan community, especially the youth, are in a state of shock. Things have happened very quickly, very dramatically. We couldn't expect how quickly the Taliban could take over. But the first hope is that people are safe."""

The Panamanian-flagged and Japanese-owned ship Ever Given on Friday crossed the Suez Canal for the first time since it blocked the waterway for six days in March, the Suez Canal Authority (SCA) said in a statement.

""The 400-metre, 220,000-ton container ship that was docked at the UK port of Felixstowe, has returned to Port Said on Thursday night,"" the statement.

""Accompanied by two tug boats and most professional guides, all security measures were taken to ensure the safe crossing of the ship,"" the SCA said.

The ship ran aground in Egypt's Suez Canal and jammed global shipping traffic for nearly a week until it was refloated on March 29 by a fleet of Egyptian tugboats and diggers.

The ship was seized for more than three months until the SAC and ship owner reached a deal in July allowing the vessel to leave Egyptian waters."

China held a meeting to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the peaceful liberation of Tibet in Lhasa, capital of southwest China's Tibet Autonomous Region, on Thursday. Wang Yang, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, delivered a speech and introduced Tibet's progress in economy, travel, education and cultural protection over past years.

Tourism development

Tibet is a popular tourist destination with a rich ethnic culture, natural resources and beautiful scenery. The region has 116 tourist areas with a continuously developing tourist industry and improving tourist facilities. According to Wang, during the 13th Five-Year Plan period (2016 ¨C 2020), Tibet hosted close to 160 million tourists visits. The autonomous region now has a well-connected infrastructure, with Fuxing bullet trains travelling past snow-capped mountains.

Also, the Lhasa-Nyingchi Railway has begun operations since the end of June. It runs through southeast Tibet, allowing travelers to explore the magnificent hinterland. The 435-kilometer railway shortens the journey between Lhasa and Nyingchi by 3.5 hours. More than 106,000 passenger trips were recorded in the first month of operation with a daily average of 3,500 trips, according to a China State Railway Group statement released last week. Every administrative village is also linked by roads, and 140 flights connect Tibet with the rest of the country and other parts of the world, Wang added.

Cultural treasures

Besides the beautiful scenes, Tibet has been known of precious deposits of cultural treasures, which, after decades of exploration, are regaining glitz. The central government has invested a lot of manpower, resources and funding to preserve and develop Tibet's fine traditional culture. The Tibetan language is used extensively. Precious classics such as ""Epic of King Gesar"" were saved and collected, Wang said. Close to 800 projects, including thangka, Tibetan Opera and Tibetan medicine have been placed on the List of Intangible Cultural Heritage. In 2018, Tibetan medical bathing was listed in the World Intangible Cultural Heritage of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), bringing the land and the wisdom of its residents to the world once again.

Besides the ancient therapy, two other cultural items from Tibet have also been listed ¨C Tibetan Opera and the ""Epic of King Gesar."" They are only a small piece of the cultural treasures on the plateau. Since Tibet launched its project on protecting the intangible cultural heritage in 2006, at least 300 million yuan (about $46.2 million) has been invested in the project, 195 million yuan of which from the central government. To preserve Tibet's cultural relics in the area, starting in 2016, the autonomous region's government built the Museum for Intangible Cultural Heritage, which was completed on May 18, 2018. As a region where religion plays a critical role, the rise and prosperity of the cultural resources could also be owed to the pervasiveness of Lamaism and the harmonious environment which breeds it.

According to a Xinhua report in 2018, Tibet has about 1,780 temples or sites where religious activities are conducted regularly, as well as more than 46,000 registered monks and nuns. Alongside Lamaism, other religions exist in the region, including Islam and Catholicism. The Potala Palace, the Jokhang Temple, and other temples and sites have been renovated and are under protection. Also, large-scale religious activities, such as Kora around holy mountains and rivers, Saga Dawa Festival, Shoton Festival, and Shining the Buddha, are all practiced, protected, and inherited, adding charm to the roof of the world. ""Today's Tibet enjoys freedom of religious belief, social harmony and ethnic amity,"" said Wang, ""We should protect and keep alive the fine traditional culture in Tibet and promote its creative evolution and development.""

Education and welfare

In addition to tourism development and the protection of cultural treasures, people's life in the region have improved over the past 70 years, which is reflected in education and medical care. Wang indicated that in old Tibet, over 90 percent of Tibetans struggled for subsistence, and up to 95 percent were illiterate. Today, hunger and poverty are a thing of the past for people of all ethnic groups in Tibet, and per capita living space in Tibet is close to 40 square meters. Also, the 15-year public-funded education is granted across the region, ending the long-standing issue of school dropouts, Wang said. Students attending public schools in Tibet can enjoy exemption of a list of fees, including tuition, accommodation, textbooks, meals, transportation and other miscellaneous costs, from preschool to senior high school. Parents who were once reluctant to send their children to school for fear of fees are now free from pressure.

Traditionally, Tibet's education was centered in and almost completely gripped by monasteries, except for a few old-style private schools. Back in that time, monks were teachers, lections were textbooks and praying halls were classrooms. There was no organized educational system nor an institution to take charge. The study of modern sciences, like math, physics and chemistry, was virtually nonexistent. Things began to change following the peaceful liberation in 1951 when the central government of the People's Republic of China and the local government of Tibet signed a 17-article agreement, in which they agreed ""school education of the Tibetan nationality shall be developed step by step.""

Tibet's modern education was virtually built from scratch. From the first Qamdo Primary School to a group of new primary schools in Xigaze, Chagyab, Bome, Nyingchi, Ngari and Lhasa that emerged afterward, Tibet's modern education system gradually came into being. Tibet now boasts an all-level education system that covers kindergarten, elementary, higher education, vocational education, adult education and special education."
Tibet achieves great success in ecological protection,"As one of China's most important ecological security barriers, Tibet Autonomous Region in southwest China has made huge achievements in ecological protection.

Having the second largest wetland area in the country, Tibet has so far designated 70 percent of its wetlands as parks and conservation areas, with wetland protection becoming a part of locals' daily lives.

""If the wetland is not clean, it's like our home is not clean. We have to protect ecology, passing down the good environment from generation to generation,"" said Sonam Wangchen, a volunteer at Mirui Wetland Park."
China sees significant progress in safeguarding cultural relics,"China has made remarkable improvement in the excavation, utilization and protection of cultural relics since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China in 2012, according to a report submitted on Wednesday for deliberations to the ongoing session of the Standing Committee of the 13th National People's Congress.

The country is home to 766,700 unmovable cultural relics, 108 million pieces (sets) of state-owned movable cultural relics and 56 UNESCO World Heritage sites, such as Liangzhu Archaeological Site and the ancient port of Quanzhou, the Emporium of the World in Song-Yuan China, according to the report from the State Council.

China has also made significant achievements in numerous archaeological projects, and strengthened archaeological work by approving the implementation of over 7,000 archaeological excavation projects, says the report.

Steady progress has been made in underwater archaeology, notes the report. For instance, over 180,000 pieces (sets) of cultural relics were excavated from Nanhai (South China Sea) No. 1, a cargo ship from the Song Dynasty (960-1279) salvaged in the South China Sea in 2007."

Lawmakers in the UK have been debating the situation in Afghanistan, with many venting their anger at Prime Minister Boris Johnson over the speed at which the Afghan government collapsed.

Parliament was recalled early from its summer break to debate the emergency session, which went on for more than seven hours.

Former Prime Minister Theresa May said it was ""incomprehensible"" the UK did not help sustain the government in Afghanistan, given its military involvement in the country.

""Was our intelligence really so poor? Was our understanding of the Afghan government so weak? Was our knowledge of the position on the ground so inadequate or did we really believe this? Or did we just feel that we had to follow the United States and hope that, on a wing and a prayer, it would be alright on the night?"" she said.

Despite the criticism, Johnson defended the UK's role in the 20-year conflict, saying it had achieved its goals.

""The United Kingdom, among others, joined America in going into Afghanistan on a mission to extirpate al-Qaeda in that country and to do whatever we could to stabilize Afghanistan, in spite of all the difficulties and challenges we knew we would face. And we succeeded in that core mission,"" he said.

The UK, like most Western nations involved in Afghanistan, has been scrambling to get its citizens and staff out of the country.

Many lawmakers also called for more help for Afghan refugees, especially those who have helped serve with British forces and diplomatic missions.

On Tuesday, the government in Westminster announced it would be accepting 20,000 more refugees from Afghanistan over the coming years, with 5,000 in the first year of the scheme.

Afghans watch and worry

As politicians debated the withdrawal and future situation, thousands of Afghans living in the UK are watching events closely, many of them worried about family and loved ones back home.

Zemar Sakha fled Afghanistan during the Soviet invasion in the 1980s and is saddened the country is still suffering conflict several decades later.

""I was an army officer, I left Afghanistan 36 years ago. We never, ever guessed one day it will be like this. We can imagine any kind of situation but not a worse situation like now. This is something unimaginable for our people.""

Another Afghan living in London, Hussein Amiri, said he had made contact with relatives in Kabul and that ""they were currently staying indoors and that the streets of the city felt much quieter.""

For much of Afghanistan's diaspora, war has been a constant theme of their lives. The United Nations and the international community ¨C including the UK ¨C have raised concerns about a possible humanitarian crisis arising from the latest violence.

Once a refugee himself, Sakha hopes Western nations do not turn their backs on the Afghan people.

""They have to support us any way they can because they are part of the problem, all the West is involved in this problem, all of the West,"" he said."
"Bosten lake, a paradise for waterfowls in NW China","Located in Bayingolin Mongol Autonomous Prefecture, northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, Bosten Lake is a paradise for waterfowls.

It is the largest inland freshwater lake in the country, thus it was called ""West Sea"" in ancient times. Rich in fishes, the lake is now the largest fishery base in Xinjiang and it attracts numerous waterfowls.

Shanghai's largest ecological sponge park opens to public,"Shanghai's largest ecological sponge park opened to the public on Monday.

The park covers 54 hectares, is the largest sponge park in Shanghai, and is equipped to retain and purify water. The facility can absorb and collect water when it rains for use when necessary, as the whole park is like a gaint ""sponge.""

The concept of an ecological sponge park is based on the need to create a space that is environmentally sound and can absorb, purify and discharge stormwater, which is practical for a rainy city like Shanghai.

The park has an exhibition area that displays how water collection, purification and release process from its sedimentation tanks back to the river. The giant ""sponge"" is of great significance to the ecological protection of the region.

As it is connected with the Shanghai Astronomy Museum, the world's largest astronomy museum, the park is also full of astronomical elements.



It boasts eight well-designed structures and is divided into different functional areas, including a leisure star-gazing area and an astronomical experience area.



""One of the structures in the park is like a planet. We've named it 'the weightless planet,' in which visitors may experience the feeling of weightlessness in space,"" said Fan Jinlong, vice president of the China Construction Science and Technology Group Co., Ltd.



Visitors can also observe the stars at night at the park, according to Zhu Jian, director of the investment attraction department of Lingang business travel company.



""We will also organize various tent camps and astronomical activities outside the astronomy museum. Catering service with different contents and themes will also be set up in each of the eight supporting structures,"" said Zhu.

After the trial operation, various commercial, cultural and tourism projects will be gradually introduced into the park that will be built into a support facility of Shanghai Astronomy Museum."

Old wine in new bottle: Ancient Chinese wine attracts millennials,"02:12

The yellow rice wine, also known as ""huangjiu"" in Chinese, is regarded as one of the world's three major ancient alcoholic drinks ¨C together with beer and wine. Widely known all over China, the grain-fermented drink is a staple of Shaoxing, a city in east China's Zhejiang Province. While sticking to its classic uses, over the years, people in Shaoxing have explored various new recipes for the yellow rice wine.

Head chef Chen Long, a 24-year-old man hailing from Shaoxing, cooks with yellow rice wine daily. ""Crabs or shrimps pickled with yellow rice wine are often on traditional Chinese menus. We also have more innovative recipes like chicken steamed with yellow rice wine,"" Chen said.

Crayfish pickled with yellow rice wine. /Li Xiquan Crayfish pickled with yellow rice wine. /Li Xiquan

Yellow rice wine is often used for seasoning. Its alchohol content is low, ranging from 14 to 20 percent. Once sealed in clay jars, it has a decades-long shelf life, mellowing with age. The brewcraft of the yellow rice wine has been passed down for more than 2,500 years. Its ancient craft is designated as one of China's national intangible cultural heritage. In the past, people used to unseal aged yellow rice wine on their children's coming-of-age day ceremonies. Like a time capsule, the wine carries people's best wishes for life.

For today's millennials, however, this centuries-old heritage is nothing more than an old-fashioned drink. For many, beer or grape wine are the more popular drink of choice. Attempting to revive yellow rice wine, winemakers are reshaping its image. Yellow rice wine-flavored popsicles, yogurt, or even milk tea, are the new trend among young adults in Shaoxing.

""The milk tea has a flavor of Shaoxing. It is very distinctive,"" one of the customers said. Ruan Shuai, deputy director of marketing at Yellow Wine Museum of China, said, ""We have introduced fashionable packaging and positioning to provide a new product image of yellow rice wine to consumers.""

To rejuvenate the treasured drink, Shaoxing Yellow Rice Wine Association holds an annual yellow rice wine carnival, catering to millennials. It also adopts new marketing strategies, such as engineered photo opportunities made for social media and live performances with rock bands. Now public perception is gradually changing.

""To Shaoxing people, yellow rice wine can be a sustenance with an emotional attachment to it and a lifestyle. We want to give it a new meaning, passing it down from generation to generation,"" Ruan said."

"China displays 2,000-year-old relics unearthed in Guangzhou","An exhibition opened at the National Museum of China on August 10, highlighting archaeological findings of ancient China's Qin (221--207 BC) and Han (202 BC--AD 220) dynasties excavated in Guangzhou, capital of south China's Guangdong Province. The exhibition opened with the display of 332 items of cultural relics of the Qin and Han dynasties, and will last until November 9. Among the items on display, some representative remains mark the identity, class and status of the top aristocrats of the Nanyue Kingdom. The architectural components, coins and wooden slips from the Nanyue Palace show the specifications of the high-level palaces and the luxurious life of the aristocrats at that time.

""The relics can reflect the major achievements of archaeological work in Guangzhou in recent years and show the historical and cultural features of the Lingnan area dating back to more than 2,000 years ago,"" said Zhai Shengli, the curator of the exhibition department at the museum. The gold dragon button seal unearthed at the Nanyue King tomb has attracted a lot of attention for its design, a legendary dragon-like tiger, and its material, which broke the rule that all imperial seals were made of white jade.

The gold seal was found between the chest and abdomen of the tomb owner, marking the most reliable evidence of the identity of the owner.



""The gold seal of the king of Nanyue, Zhao Mo, unearthed at the Nanyue King tomb is the largest gold seal excavated so far. It is also the only gold dragon button seal, which reflects the identity and status of the Nanyue rulers, and a series of historical facts recorded in the literature at that time,"" according to Zhai.



Jade burial suits were used by emperors and senior aristocrats in the Han Dynasty.



The corpse of Zhao and his jade burial suit, which is on display, were so decayed that the pieces of jade scattered on the ground after excavation. It took more than three years for the experts to restore the suit.



""The jade burial suit unearthed at the Nanyue King tomb is a relatively ancient suit in our archaeological findings. It is about a decade earlier than the jade clothes sewn with gold wire unearthed at the Han tombs of Mancheng. Besides, this jade burial suit is not sewn with gold, silver or copper wires as recorded in the literature, but sewn with silk threads,"" said Zhai.



The exhibits include 38 first-class cultural relics, 43 second-class ones and 53 at the third-class level, as well as exquisite items that have not been rated."

Shanghai Acrobatic Troupe director speaks about modern acrobats,"03:26

Shanghai Acrobatic Troupe, a major Chinese acrobatic troupe, has opened the second season of its highly popular resident show ""Era ¨C Intersection of Time."" This updated version of ""Era"" centers on a young man's encounter with a girl who lends him an umbrella on a rainy day. It follows his adventurous search for the mysterious young woman in Shanghai, which culminates when the two are reunited for a romantic dance on a giant iron ring. For the troupe's director Yu Yigang, it was all about making ""Era 2"" more relatable to the audiences, and this meant exploring new possibilities in traditional acrobatics. ""Acrobatics were often shown as individual acts with little or no coherence between the acts. Now as people's aesthetics grow, we're also exploring new possibilities of the art form with the 'Era' series, going back to its roots,"" Yu told CGTN.

Yu added that broadly speaking, zaji, or acrobatics, encompassed various performance skills that originated from daily life, as well as physical feats and martial arts. For instance, the tableware used in performances involving spinning plates and juggling jugs as well as the chairs stacked up for the balancing acts all come from dining rooms. ""In a sense, acrobatics is an art form that expresses people's energetic life forces from daily lives. And that's how we were able to make the acts more relatable to the audience, with the help of visual projections and new technologies,"" Yu said. Since the premiere of ""Era 1"" in 2005, the world of live entertainment has seen major changes, such as shows having more theatrical elements, according to Yu.

Today, acrobats need to be more than just agile athletes; they need to be entertainers and performers on stage, Yu told CGTN. ""In the past, acrobats only had to think about accomplishing their acts flawlessly, but now they have to engage with the audience in their performances to play a convincing role. That way their performance can truly reach the audience and resonate with them,"" he explained. It's equally important for modern shows to have a cultural identity.

Revisiting the past and present of the Shoton Festival in Tibet,"The annual Shoton Festival runs from late in the sixth month on the Tibetan calendar and lasts until the beginning of the seventh month. In the solar calendar, it takes place from August 8 to 14 this year.



The centuries-old festival is one of the most renowned banquets in Lhasa, the capital of southwest China's Tibet Autonomous Region, during summer. It usually kicks off with the Thangka unfolding ceremony, a Tibetan Opera performance and other celebrations.

A time-honored festival

Originally a religious observance from the 11th century, the Shoton Festival was inscribed among China's first batch of entries to the National List of Intangible Cultural Heritage on May 20, 2006. The festival has become a grand feast with many activities since the 17th century.

""Sho"" means ""yogurt"" in the Tibetan language, ""ton"" means ""banquet"" or ""eating."" Thus, Shoton Festival can be translated as ""a festival for eating yogurt."" After years of development, it has evolved into one of the largest cultural tourism events in Lhasa.

Tibetan Opera has been one of the most popular activities during the weeklong gala. Last year, troupes from Qinghai, Sichuan, Gansu and Yunnan provinces went to Lhasa to join the Tibetan Opera performances. The festival is also called Tibetan Opera festival.



""Tibetan Opera mainly tells folktales and legends. It was once only favored by older audiences, but now more young people are interested,"" the head of Deashue Tibetan Opera Troupe told CGTN during an interview.

2021 marks the 70th anniversary of the peaceful liberation of Tibet, which is one of the themes of this year's Shoton Festival. The 100th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China (CPC) was also celebrated at this year's Shoton Festival, highlighting the enormous changes that have occurred in the autonomous region."

""I think that for the dragon boat performance at Tokyo Olympics this time, we have taken a solid step forward for the dragon boat to enter the Olympic Games,"" said Yang Guang, head of the Chinese dragon boat performance team for Tokyo Olympics.

""According to the plans of the International Canoe Federation (ICF), this sport will be promoted in many countries. We hope we can see the dragon boat racing as an official Olympic sport at the Olympic arenas soon.""



Thomas Bach, president of the International Olympic Committee, also attended the showcase. He had a conversation with Chinese paddlers Liu Hao and Zheng Pengfei, who took the silver medal in the men's canoe double 1,000m competition on Tuesday. When the event drew to a conclusion, the China Canoe Association presented Bach with a model of the dragon boat used in the show as a gift.



As a representative of Chinese culture, the dragon boat race is known as a traditional practice of the Dragon Boat Festival to commemorate the death of patriotic poet Qu Yuan (340 BC-278 BC) during the Warring States period of ancient China. The traditional festival falls on the fifth day of the fifth month of the lunar Chinese calendar."

NW China's Xinjiang successful in expanding 'green wall',"An afforestation project aimed to build a great ""green wall"" in Aksu Prefecture of northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region has been transforming the vast desert into an oasis.

The Kekeya Green Project is aimed to prevent further desertification and reduce the impacts of sand and dust storms on nearby residents.

Launched in Kekeya in 1986, the project was completed in 2015. In Uygur, ""kekeya"" refers to gullies, meaning trenches through which water often runs after it rains. But in Kekeya, rainfall was scarce.

Located at the northwestern edge of the Taklamakan, the largest desert in China, Kekeya was notorious for its erratic weather and constant sandstorms.

""We have built a shelter forest on the edge of the city. The aim is mainly to prevent the invasion of wind and sand,"" said Zhang Zhijun, senior engineer of Aksu Forestry Bureau.

Song Jianjiang, a forest ranger of the Green Project, has lived in Kekeya since the tree-planting project began over three decades ago. ""The project has brought earth-shaking changes to Aksu's environment,"" Song said. ""Now, we see trees grow day after day, [with] blue skies and white clouds. The air quality is also very good. We are very proud and happy to see all this.""

Local officials said forests now cover at least 80,000 hectares of Kekeya's land, and dust storms are less frequent. The area now sees about 120 millimeters of rainfall per year.

The project has turned the desert into an oasis, attracting throngs of tourists to observe the beauty of the unique landscape."
China's tourism hit hard as COVID-19 cases surge during summer holiday,"China's summer tourism has taken a big hit as local authorities ask people to avoid inter-provincial traveling. Following the latest wave of COVID-19 cases, the government has imposed restrictions on travel and shut down tourist spots in cities with medium and high-risk areas.

The country's tourism industry was hoping for a big recovery at this summer holiday, but the spreading Delta variant of the coronavirus has put an end to those hopes. Many travel agencies have lost almost all their bookings for the travel season.

""Ninety percent of our recent orders are gone. We're dealing with a large amount of refunds,"" said Zhen Hao, president of travel agency Easytour. ""Before the (virus) outbreak, we were very confident about the summer season and ready to recover our losses. But now, it's all gone.""

Official data shows the first half of 2021 saw only a 60 percent recovery in the number of domestic tourists for the same period in 2019. After a stricken 2020, tourism operators saw this summer holiday as a long-awaited opportunity.

Han Jie, vice president of CYTS AOYOU, one of the major travel agencies in China, told CGTN that summer holidays are normally the longest and most profitable time for the industry.

""Summer holidays are prime time for family travels. And it is the longest travel season for the whole year,"" Han added, ""We've developed so many family tour packages for the summer. Bookings were very hot, especially for places like Tibet, Xinjiang and Hainan.¡±"

The UK government has issued the latest tweaks to its international COVID-19 travel policies in a boost to overseas summer holidays. Seven countries have been added to its Green List, meaning no quarantines are required upon arrival. However the travel sector and opposition politicians say there is still too much confusion and uncertainty.

From 4 a.m. on Sunday, fully vaccinated travelers arriving into the UK from France ¨C many of them on Eurostar trains coming into the terminal at London's St. Pancras International station ¨C will no longer have to quarantine at home for 10 days.

That's because France has been taken off the government's Amber-Plus List for international travel.

Another holiday hotspot Spain has been kept on the Amber List, despite concern over the Beta strain of COVID-19.

Moved onto Amber off the Red List ¨C those countries from which require special hotel quarantine for 10 days ¨C include India, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. Mexico has been put on Red.

Seven countries are now on the Green List ¨C Germany, Austria, Norway and Romania among them.

The lists won't be reviewed for another three weeks which the transport secretary says balances caution with a level of relaxation that holiday makers can enjoy for the rest of August.

""You can never say zero chance with coronavirus,"" said Britain's Transportation Secretary Grant Shapps."

Locals are concerned over the recent outbreaks of COVID-19 cases in 15 Chinese provinces, which have been reported to be linked to cases from different overseas sources. In this context, what is the outlook for the upcoming back-to-school season? Can holiday travel continue unhindered? The Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism of the State Council of China held a press conference on Thursday to respond to these concerns and briefed the media about the further strengthening of COVID-19 containment measures.

""Judging from the overall current situation of the epidemic, one can say that it should be controllable,"" said He Qinghua, an inspector at the Bureau of Disease Control and Prevention of the National Health Commission. He said the current outbreak has a wide range and involves cases from different overseas sources, posing a challenge for containment efforts. However, as long as all prevention and control measures are strictly implemented, the epidemic can be controlled within two to three incubation periods, or four to six weeks if the latency period is calculated at 14 days, he said.

Back-to-school: Different schools, different policies

Liu Peijun, deputy director of the Ministry of Education's physical education, health and art department, also addressed parents' concerns at the press conference. The autumn back-to-school arrangement should be arranged according to local conditions to ensure the orderly start of the fall semester, he said. Liu said study stages as well as local conditions and situation of COVID-19 outbreaks are different in various provinces and regions. Therefore, the autumn semester this year should be arranged in accordance with the country's overall epidemic containment decisions as well as local actualities and policy arrangements. Considering its own situation and the realities of different schools, each province and city should decide on the specific arrangements for reopening schools, epidemic containment measures and teaching and educational activities, he explained. However, he said schools in medium-high risk areas should suspend in-person teaching activities and postpone the new semester. In fact, many provincial and municipal education departments have issued a variety of local policies. For example, Beijing requires students of its primary and secondary schools and kindergartens to return to Beijing 14 days before the start of the new semester and monitor their health situation daily, while Jiangxi, Henan, Hunan, Fujian and Heilongjiang provinces are speeding up the vaccination of minors.

Canada's Quebec province to introduce vaccine passport,"Quebec announced Thursday it will introduce a vaccine passport, the first in Canada, to counter a fourth wave of the COVID-19 and the spread of the Delta variant.

""The principle behind the vaccine passport is that people who have made the effort to get their two doses should be able to live a semi-normal life,"" provincial prime minister Francois Legault told a press conference.

He added that the specific terms of the passport will be revealed in the coming days, but mentioned access to non-essential activities such as going to a restaurant.

Legault did not specify what date the pass will go into force in the province, where 83 percent of people over age 12 have received at least one vaccine shot, and 67 percent both.

""We will give certain privileges to those who have agreed to make the effort to get their two shots,"" Legault said.

As of Wednesday, Quebec had recorded 305 new cases in 24 hours, up from about 100 per day in recent days.

This increase is ""still much lower than what we see in the United States, in most of the countries in Europe, but it remains that we can already talk about the beginning of a fourth wave,"" Legault warned.

He ruled out the possibility of another lockdown in the province, however.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau backed the move, saying: ""I fully support the initiative of Mr Legault and the Quebec government.""

Trudeau also said he was considering the possibility of making vaccination mandatory for all federal employees."

Ongoing uncertainty

It's welcome news for the beleaguered travel industry, but industry figures say there is still too much uncertainty around the way the government makes its decisions.

""There is progress here and it's to be welcomed that some countries are opening up further. But it's still a complicated traffic light system,"" Paul Charles, CEO of travel consultancy The PC Agency, told CGTN, criticizing the latest reshuffle.

""It doesn't go far enough in widening the list of green countries. There are many countries eligible to be green. And it doesn't address one of the key issues that consumers have, which is which is around the lack of notice before a country changes color.

""If I make a booking as a consumer, I want to make sure that I'm not going to be charged more if I have to change my booking at the last minute,"" said Charles. ""And the government is not guaranteeing that it won¡¯t change countries at short notice.""

Origin of the dragon boat race As a representative of Chinese culture, the dragon boat race is best known and long believed as a traditional practice of the Dragon Boat Festival to commemorate the patriotic poet Qu Yuan (340 B.C.-278 B.C.) during the Warring States period of ancient China. But according to the book ""Yuanling Millennium Dragon Boat,"" the dragon boat originated in what is now Yuanling County, central China's Hunan Province, 5,000 years ago, which is much earlier than the living time of Qu.

Turpan City in China's Xinjiang leverages thermal energy for tourism,"Turpan City in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region is leveraging its rich thermal energy capability under a new economic growth model to boost its travel industry.

Surrounded by deserts and mountains, Turpan is well-known for its immense summertime heat energy, which has provided favorable resources for developing sectors of thermal therapy, healthcare service, eco-tourism and sand-heating cure, among a host of other applications in light of its geographical and climate conditions.

According to the local meteorological bureau, the Flaming Mountain scenic area, a tourist attraction known for its fire-like sandstone, has recently seen its temperature surge to the highest in a year, with the maximum daytime temperature of around 45 degrees Celsius.

Readings from a giant thermometer standing in the scenic spot show surface temperature can reach some 70 degrees Celsius every day between 3 p.m. and 4 p.m.

Many tourists flock to the Flaming Mountain during the summer holiday season.

Local vendors are ready to impress people traveling from other places with eggs cooked in hot sand. It takes about an hour to cook the eggs in a sandpit, but the unique cooking method, the ""egg hill,"" has attracted many travelers and shutterbugs.

The sand serves not only as an oven but also as a bath tube.

The city has built numerous ""sand therapy"" places for people to bury themselves in the sand in the sun.

Long-term studies show that sand therapy helps treat diseases like arthritis and sciatica, thanks to the combination of heat, arid conditions, the sun's rays and minerals from the sand."

The restrictions began to lift at the end of spring, based on the number of first dose vaccines.

Istvan Szelei, from Budapest-based travel operator Multigo Tours, explained that people are much more willing to bet on a holiday here this year.

""They think 'Okay, we are vaccinated, we've done our stuff within the country, but we don't know what other countries have done ¨C so let's stay here for another year, and next year we will go outside,"" he said.

Variants and administration

Around Balaton festivals like the annual Jazz Picnic draw in close to 20,000 people over a weekend, the numbers back on track after last year's event was canceled.

Many of those traveling to the festival told CGTN they had come from Budapest and would usually spend their holidays overseas. One couple explained many Hungarians won't travel abroad as they're concerned about virus variants and the ongoing administration involved with overseas trips.

Tourism experts say 80 percent of Hungarian holidaymakers have opted to stay in the country because of the pandemic. The younger age groups are the most likely to head overseas, with those in their twenties particularly taking advantage of increased flights to Greece, where the tourism industry reopened months before other countries.

While Hungarians are hesitant to go overseas, the number of tourists coming into Hungary is also seriously affected. Inbound tourism providers are holding on for next year, while the domestic tourism industry begins to recover.

Winery owner Szabolcs Homola explained that luckily for the Balaton region, its recovery is slightly ahead. ""The tourism sector in the whole country will need at least two more years to get back,"" he said, ""but here in Lake Balaton next year we will get to the old numbers, where we were before.""

While any recovery is good news, there's still a long way to go and any recovery won't make up for the losses during the pandemic. For now, the focus for tourism providers at Balaton is to encourage overseas guests by growing cultural programs outside of the peak summer season."

The United Kingdom's decision to maintain restrictions only for French travelers is a ""discriminatory"" move, French Minister of State for European Affairs Clement Beaune said on Thursday, calling on Britain to review it ""as soon as possible.""

""It's excessive, it's frankly incomprehensible on health grounds and discriminatory towards the French,"" Beaune told LCI television.

""It's not based on science. There is no justification for this decision, I hope that it will be reviewed as soon as possible,"" he said.

Starting from Aug. 2, vaccinated visitors from the United States and the European Union will no longer need to quarantine on arrival in England, the British government announced on Wednesday.

Meanwhile, London maintained the quarantine for French travelers, citing the presence of the Beta variant, first detected in South Africa, in France.

France was not planning reciprocity measures ""for now,"" he added. ""We base our decisions on health criteria."""

Travelers who are fully vaccinated in the United States and European Union, except France will be allowed entry in England without having to quarantine on arrival, the UK government announced on Wednesday.

""We're helping reunite people living in the US and European countries with their family and friends,"" Transport Secretary Grant Shapps tweeted.

The policy will come into force from 4:00 am (0300 GMT) on August 2.

Travelers fully jabbed with a vaccine approved by the US Food and Drug Administration or the European Medicines Agency will be able to travel from any country on the British government's ""amber"" traffic light list without having to self-isolate at home for 10 days.

They will still need to do a pre-departure test and take another test on day two after arriving in England.

Separate rules will continue to apply for those arriving from France due to the government's concern over the ""persistent presence"" of the Beta variant, which is believed to be more resistant to vaccines.""

Those traveling from an amber list country, which includes most of Europe and the US, who are not fully vaccinated will still have to quarantine on arrival.

""By reopening quarantine-free travel for travelers who have been fully vaccinated in European countries and the U.S., we're taking another step on the road to normality which will reunite friends and families and give UK businesses a boost,"" Health Secretary Sajid Javid said.

The government also confirmed the restart of international cruises.

""This is progress we can all enjoy,"" wrote Shapps.

Britain is in the midst of another wave of the virus due to the Delta variant, although case numbers have dropped over the past week, while its vaccine drive has seen more than 70 percent of adults fully jabbed.

The devolved governments of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland set their own health policies, and decide their own foreign travel rules, but are consulting with London over a UK-wide policy."

Battered by the wind and swell for 400 years and nicknamed the ""king of lighthouses,"" France's Cordouan beacon is the last of its kind in France and only the second after Spain's La Coruna to win the plaudit from the world heritage governing body.



Cordouan was built at the very end of the 16th century and stands in the Atlantic Ocean at the mouth of the Gironde estuary in southwestern France in a ""highly exposed and hostile environment,"" according to the UNESCO World Heritage Committee, which announced its decision at the committee's annual meeting in Fuzhou, southeast China's Fujian Province on Saturday.



The lighthouse was designed by engineer Louis de Foix and was later remodeled by engineer Joseph Teulere in the late 18th century.



Describing it as a ""masterpiece of maritime signaling,"" the committee said, ""Cordouan's monumental tower is decorated with pilasters, columns, modillions and gargoyles.""



""It embodies the great stages of the architectural and technological history of lighthouses and was built with the ambition of continuing the tradition of famous beacons of antiquity, illustrating the art of building lighthouses in a period of renewed navigation, when beacons played an important role as territorial markers and as instruments of safety.""



The increase in its height in the late 18th century and changes to its light chamber at the same time were also noteworthy, the committee said.



They ""attest to the progress of science and technology of the period. Its architectural forms drew inspiration from ancient models, Renaissance Mannerism and the specific architectural language of France's engineering school Ecole des Ponts et Chaussees.""

It was built between 1573 and 1620 and its residents are mostly members of the Buyi ethnic group. In 2000, an ecomuseum was sponsored by Norway to preserve the Buyi culture."
Buddha head stolen from Tianlongshan Grottoes returns to N China,"The stolen Buddha head from Tianlongshan Grottoes returns to its home in Taiyuan City, north China's Shanxi Province, July 24, 2021. /CFP The stolen Buddha head from Tianlongshan Grottoes returns to its home in Taiyuan City, north China's Shanxi Province, July 24, 2021. /CFP

A Buddha head from the Tianlongshan Grottoes was returned to its home in Taiyuan City, north China's Shanxi Province, on Saturday, marking the first time in nearly a century that a relic has returned to China from Japan.

The head belongs to a Buddha statue in one of the caves at Tianlongshan Grottoes. It was illegally shipped out of the country in 1924, and was only retrieved in December 2020. The sculpture shows a Buddha with a round face, pursing his lips in a smile. Its carvings have the distinctive features of the late Northern Dynasty (386-581) to the early Sui Dynasty (581-619). The head is 33.7 centimeters long, 30.4 centimeters wide, and 44.5 centimeters high. It weighs 55.5 kilograms.

The Buddha head, which was brought back from Japan on December 12, 2020, is the 100th relic retrieved by China from overseas in 2020, according to the National Cultural Heritage Administration (NCHA).

As the core exhibit of the ""Return of National Treasures"" theme exhibition, the head of the Buddha appeared in the Tianlongshan Grottoes Museum. The exhibition comprehensively tells the history of the loss and return of the relics of the Tianlongshan Grottoes through the use of precious cultural relics, historical pictures, digital restoration, and 3D printing of the grottoes.

Yu Hao, curator of the Tianlongshan Grottoes Museum, explained why the head of the Buddha was not put back in its original location. He said that the cave wall where the head of the Buddha was originally located was close to the cliff body, which was badly cracked. If the head of the Buddha was placed in its original position, it would be difficult to avoid some degree of weathering. So the Buddha head will be preserved and permanently displayed in the museum. Specially designed lighting and display cases in the exhibition hall will be able to protect the Buddha head to a greater extent.

Zhang Rong, an overseas Chinese living in Japan and the donor of the Buddha head, said, ""The donation of the Buddha head is a milestone in my life. At least I have done what I should do. I have brought the Buddha head, which has been separated from its body for a hundred years, to return to my motherland.""

In addition, Zhang has decided to donate the 300,000 yuan (about $46,286) awarded by the government to support the recovery of cultural relics, so that more national treasures can be returned to the motherland in the future."

An updated World Heritage List is to be unveiled this month, as the World Heritage Committee (WHC) of UNESCO holds its extended 44th session from July 16 to 31 in Fuzhou, southeast China's Fujian Province. Since the session was postponed due to the COVID-19 last year, a total of 45 nominations were examined this time, including 26 for the year 2020 and 19 for 2021.

First online session Organized by UNESCO in cooperation with the host country China, the annual session is for the first time being held online. The WHC has 21 State Parties. To coordinate the time difference, the daily plenary sessions of the Committee lasts only four hours, usually from 17:30 to 21:30 Beijing time. How to effectively conduct the deliberations within limited time serves as a reference for the session's future online-offline work in the post-pandemic era. A series of side events include the World Heritage Young Professionals Forum, the World Heritage Site Managers' Forum, and eight side meetings hosted solely by China.

Categories of World Heritage The World Heritage refers to the unique and irreplaceable cultural and natural heritage considered to be of ""Outstanding Universal Value"" to humanity irrespective of the territory on which they are located. The representatives are China's Great Wall and the Forbidden City, Egypt's Great Pyramids and Brazil's Central Amazon Conservation Complex. World Heritages are divided into three categories: the natural, the mixed, and the cultural. When a property is recognized as the World Heritage, it usually gets increased worldwide attention and sometimes the financial support such as the World Heritage Fund, and its tourism is promoted, bringing in rich economic benefits. As a part of a nation's soft power, it can also enhance its self-confidence, pride and international recognition. As of June 2021, there are 1,121 monuments in 167 State Parties listed as World Heritage Sites, including 39 mixed, 213 natural and 869 cultural properties. China and Italy boasts 55 World Heritage Sites each, leading the world.

Great Barrier Reef and others in the spotlight Before the opening of each session, WHC's advisory bodies ¨C the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and the International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS) ¨C give their recommendations on the property to be inscribed on the list. Besides nominations, there are also 258 properties on the list to be examined for their state of conservation this year. Much attention has been drawn to some properties recommended to be listed as endangered or be deleted from the list. In recent years, marine ecosystems of the Great Barrier Reef have deteriorated at an unprecedented rate and scale. Despite Australia's efforts to implement its Reef 2050 Long-Term Sustainability Plan, the impacts of climate change, including a series of coral bleaching events in 2016, 2017, and 2020, have already taken a significant toll on the property. Also, the worsening water quality is reducing the reef's resiliency. Previously, the IUCN has recommended it inscribed on the List of World Heritage in Danger to urge strengthened global efforts to protect the Great Barrier Reef. On Friday, the Committee agreed not to place the property on the ""danger list,"" but asked Australia to submit a progress report by February 2022. Other properties on the spotlight include Liverpool ¨C Maritime Mercantile City (the UK), which was removed from the World Heritage List on Wednesday, and Venice and its Lagoon (Italy) and Budapest (Hungary) narrowly escaped from being designated as endangered World Heritage Sites on Thursday.

A heritage map of Quanzhou: Emporium of the World in Song¨CYuan China,"The ancient port of Quanzhou is seeking, for the second time, World Heritage status. The proposal, ""Quanzhou: Emporium of the World in Song¨CYuan China,"" to get the coveted tag will be evaluated by the World Heritage Committee during its 44th session held in southeast China's Fuzhou and online.

Quanzhou, on the southeastern coast of China, was one of the world's largest and busiest ports during the Song (960-1279) and Yuan (1271-1368) dynasties and is believed to be the starting point of the ancient Maritime Silk Road and a vital exchange hub for different civilizations and religions.

Today, the city, known as Zayton overseas, is home to more than eight million people as well as a significant number of cultural relics and religious sites, such as Qingjing Mosque, one of the oldest mosques in the country, and the Twin Stone Pagodas at Kaiyuan Temple, which are the highest pair of stone pagodas in China.

It is the second time that Quanzhou has applied for inclusion on the World Heritage List. The previous proposal for ""Historic Monuments and Sites of Ancient Quanzhou (Zayton),"" which includes 16 component sites, was ""deferred"" by the committee at the 42nd session in 2018."

The name of the mountain, Sanqing, means ""Three Pure Ones"" in Chinese as it has three main summits: Yujing, Yushui and Yuhua, representing Taoism's three most important deities. Due to faults, weathering and erosion, the rocks and peaks in the area are intricately shaped. Apart from the magnificent landform, delicate forest cover, ever-shifting weather patterns as well as high biodiversity are also the features of this area.

In 2008, UNESCO inscribed Mount Sanqingshan as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. According to UNESCO, Mount Sanqingshan National Park displays a unique array of forested, fantastically shaped granite pillars and peaks concentrated in a relatively small area. The looming, intricate rock formations intermixed with delicate forest cover and ever-shifting weather patterns create a landscape of arresting beauty.

About Treasure of Nature

'Pingdemic': What is it and why is it threatening the UK food supply?,"Across the UK, businesses face a staff shortage as hundreds of thousands of people are self-isolating after being contacted by an official health app telling them to do so.

That is because they have come into contact with someone testing positive for COVID-19. In the second week of July, almost 619,000 people were ""pinged"" (alerted) by the app ¨C a record number.

The result has been the closure of some supermarkets, hospitality venues struggling to get workers and, according to the Road and Haulage Association, a shortfall of around 100,000 lorry drivers to transport critical goods.

The impact on supply chains and staff is focused in ""specific places where case numbers are particularly high,"" according to Helen Dickinson, CEO of the British Retail Consortium.

The fact that self-isolation is not required by law has added to the confusion for many businesses and individuals. Earlier this week, one government minister said people could make an ""informed decision"" on whether or not to quarantine. Later that same day, Downing Street announced it was ""crucial"" people did to avoid the spread of the virus.

George Eustice, the UK's environment secretary, reiterated that message on Friday. He told Sky News that most businesses would have to follow the rules to ""dampen the pace and velocity"" of new infections.

Exemptions for critical workers

Following mounting pressure this week, the government has now brought some exemptions for key parts of the economy.

Around 10,000 workers involved in producing and supplying food will no longer need to quarantine if pinged and, with a negative test, can go back to work.

Eustice said it was ""very obvious"" why food was a priority. Adding: ""We will never take risks with our food supply.""

It follows a partial relaxation of rules across 16 other sectors, including essential transport, medical and emergency services and the energy industry.

But, those rules will be tighter. Only those who are explicitly named in letters from the government and who are double-vaccinated will be exempt.

Other sectors will miss out though ¨C such as hospitality, which is already facing a staff shortage due to the impact of the pandemic."

The Philippines will ban inbound travelers from Malaysia and Thailand from July 25 to 31 to prevent the spread of the highly infectious coronavirus Delta variant, presidential spokesperson Harry Roque said on Friday.

Roque said travelers coming directly from the two Southeast Asian countries or with a history of travel to any of the two countries within the last 14 days would be barred from entering.

""This action is undertaken to prevent the further spread and community transmission of COVID-19 variants in the Philippines,"" Roque said in a statement.

Malaysia and Thailand are experiencing a surge believed to be driven by the Delta variant cases.

Roque said that returning overseas Filipino workers under the government repatriation program are exempted from the ban but will be isolated for 14 days upon arrival.

The inclusion of Malaysia and Thailand brings to 10 the list of countries banned by the Philippines. Travelers from Indonesia, India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Oman and the United Arab Emirates are not allowed to enter the country until July 31.

The Philippines has detected 47 Delta cases in the country so far. The Department of Health confirmed the local transmission of the Delta variant first detected in India.

Aside from the Delta variant, the Philippines has also detected three other coronavirus variants of concern.

The Philippines has reported a total of 1,530,266 confirmed COVID-19 cases as of Friday, including 26,891 deaths."
Graphics: What makes China's Changsha a creative city?,"Changsha City, capital of central China's Hunan Province, was ranked among the top 10 most popular tourist destinations in the country during the five-day Labor Day holiday from May 1 to 5 and was rated one of the cities with the best nightlife. Hundreds of thousands of tourists flocked to the city by high-speed railway or air ¨C many just for a cup of milk tea or a plate of crayfish, even if it meant queuing up for hours.



So, what's behind Changsha's popularity?

Economic prowess Since 2017, Changsha has secured a place among cities having a GDP of over 1 trillion yuan (about $145 billion per 2020 average exchange rate). In 2020, there were 23 cities in the 1-trillion-yuan club.

'Capital of construction machinery' What many may not know is that Changsha, apart from being an ""online celebrity,"" is also the ""capital of construction machinery."" In 2020, Changsha's construction machinery industry posted a total output value of 250 billion yuan (about $36 billion), ranking first in China in terms of scale for 10 consecutive years and accounting for about 27.5 percent of the national total and 7.2 percent of the global total.

With an increasing contribution from the tertiary sector, Changsha's industrial structure is continuing to be optimized.

A lucrative cultural sector Moreover, Changsha's cultural sector is a pillar of its economy. The sector's share in the local economy is greater than the ones in most capital cities, with the added value accounting for 9 percent of the local GDP and a gross output of 300 billion yuan (about $43.5 billion), Mayor Zheng Jianxin said in November 2020. The fireworks industry accounted for over 30 percent of Changsha's cultural sector. Tourists on Orange Island, a popular destination in Changsha, enjoy a visual feast of fireworks during major public holidays.

Reporter's Diary in Xinjiang: Of legendary myths and experiences,"CGTN reporter Chuck Tinte poses on top of the Banlange grasslands overlooking the Kunlun Mountains. Yu Chuan/CGTN CGTN reporter Chuck Tinte poses on top of the Banlange grasslands overlooking the Kunlun Mountains. Yu Chuan/CGTN

There's something about legends of mythical kingdoms and beasts that fascinate me. Hotan ¨C an oasis town in southern Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region ¨C has multitudes of such stories, most significantly that of the Kunlun Mountains. According to ancient Chinese mythology, Kunlun was a dwelling place of gods and goddesses. It's also home to majestic animals that are white as snow and trees that bear jewelry like pearl and jade.

Stoned for the gods

One of our first stops in Hotan was in Moyu County. There we met Ahmattohti Tohtiniyaz, a Uygur man who sells Hotan jade. Major deposits of these precious and rare gemstones are said to be tucked away deep in the Kunlun Mountains. And the Chinese people consider them as ""the essence of heaven and earth.""

Precious jade sold by Uygur businessman Ahmattohti Tohtiniyaz. Chuck Tinte/CGTN Precious jade sold by Uygur businessman Ahmattohti Tohtiniyaz. Chuck Tinte/CGTN

To be honest, I never really knew how valuable jade was. I'm only most familiar of it because of jade rollers, a beauty tool used for face massage. They could cost at least 10 yuan or a little over a dollar at a popular shopping street in Beijing. You can only imagine my reaction when Ahmattohti told me how much real jade costs! One stone the size of your thumb had been priced up to 100,000 yuan ($15,625). I was shook! He said he'd been trading and selling jade for about 11 years now. He's ventured into live-streaming to expand his business.

Divine and elegant

When I think of myths and legends, I imagine warriors and deities wearing lavish attires. At Hotan's famous food market I was treated to such elegance. Nightly performances there showcase not just graceful moves, but also performers wearing traditional ethnic clothing.

Performers are seen on stage at Hotan night market. Yu Chuan/CGTN Performers are seen on stage at Hotan night market. Yu Chuan/CGTN

I repeated one word over and over as performers came out one after the other: fab! Bustling with people every night, southern Xinjiang's famous night market not only features mouth-watering eats but also sophistication through dance and music.

Sound of Music-ing

Think Julie Andrews on top of the hill, singing her lungs out. My feeling on top of Qira county's Banlange grasslands was, well, very that. We were over 3,000 meters above sea level overlooking the Kunlun Mountains.

00:23

It was magical. There we met a local family having a picnic. They were dancing to Uygur folk music when we decided to crash the party. And while I wouldn't normally twirl and pirouette in front of strangers sober, I happily agreed to their invitation to join them.

Grilled lamb and naan, a traditional Uygur meal. Chuck Tinte/CGTN Grilled lamb and naan, a traditional Uygur meal. Chuck Tinte/CGTN

After about five minutes of working my two no-so-left feet, it was time to eat. They were gracious enough to share their meal ¨C grilled lamb placed on top of a huge naan which was quite possibly the best one I've ever had. It was soft and fluffy in the center and had an incredibly crunchy crust. Food for the gods, I thought.

Then I saw a guitar, to which I asked if I can borrow. I silently played a random Filipino song, until suddenly I noticed people listening in. I shifted to an English song which I knew some people could sing along to. Until Matsen, one of our guides (and now, friend) asked if I can play a famous Chinese song entitled ""peng you"" which means friend in English. I knew the chords were pretty basic as I remember winging it once at a pub in Beijing. So I agreed.

UK wants new EU deal on Northern Ireland Protocol,"The UK says it urgently wants a new deal with the European Union to govern trade in Northern Ireland.

The current rules ¨C which were agreed between the two sides last year ¨C have led to tensions.

They include food shortages in Northern Ireland, increased checks on goods going into Northern Ireland, lengthy queues and backlogs at ports and even the re-emergence of sectarian violence on the streets.

""We cannot go on as we are,"" Brexit Minister David Frost told parliament as he announced the UK government's proposals.

""We see an opportunity to proceed differently, to find a new path to seek to agree with the EU through negotiations, a new balance in our arrangements covering Northern Ireland, to the benefit of all.""

What is the Northern Ireland Protocol?

The protocol is part of the international treaty signed between the UK and the EU last year outlining their relationship after Brexit. It is an insurance policy to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland (part of the UK) and the Republic of Ireland (part of the EU).

In order to avoid any checks on goods along the land border, the two sides agreed to initiate a trade border in the Irish Sea. That meant Northern Ireland would in effect remain in the EU's single market for goods, while England, Scotland and Wales would not.

The protocol was also designed to protect the peace process in Northern Ireland and the Good Friday Agreement, which brought an end to around three decades of sectarian conflict known as The Troubles.

The implementation of the protocol has proved onerous for businesses on both sides and has angered unionist politicians in Northern Ireland, who back closer ties with the UK.

Frost outlined key changes the UK wants to see to the protocol including keeping an open border on the island of Ireland, an extension of current grace periods to allow goods to keep moving freely across borders and, crucially, no longer having EU institutions and the European Court of Justice governing the protocol.

The latest move is unlikely to go down well with Brussels, which has insisted the deal in place must be respected.

Speaking to the BBC, Ireland's Minister for European Affairs Thomas Byrne said the protocol ""obviously has complications"" but that it cannot be redrawn.

""We're clear there can be no renegotiation of the Protocol. It's been agreed by the British government and the EU. We have to work within the confines of that agreement,"" he said.

Triggering Article 16?

Article 16 of the protocol allows either the UK or the EU to unilaterally break the terms of the deal in extreme circumstances. Frost said London would not trigger the clause even though it had the right to.

""It is clear that the circumstances exist to justify the use of Article 16. Nevertheless ... we have concluded it is not the right moment to do so,"" he said.

U.S. President Joe Biden has also previously weighed in on the issue. His administration has said the Good Friday Agreement ¨C which one of his predecessors, Bill Clinton, helped broker ¨C ""must be protected."""

China's National Cultural Heritage Administration has enhanced efforts to protect cultural relics against floods as heavy rainfall has lashed many parts of China, reported Xinhua News Agency.

Department and institutions responsible for protecting ancient relics and cultural sites across the country should pay close attention to weather forecasts and geological disasters warnings and take effective measures, according to a notice.

Cultural relics institutions and museums should formulate plans for responding to major floods and natural disasters in response to risks such as the destruction of ancient bridges, the collapse of ancient city walls, ancient buildings, and ancient trees, said the administration.

Also, the relevant departments should report damage suffered by historical sites during disasters, the administration added. Furthermore, emergency plans should be launched immediately, appropriate and effective measures should be taken to organize rescue and relief work, and follow-up protection work should be done properly, including collecting and preserving cultural relics' components, organizing the repairment and restoration of cultural relics, and minimizing the damage.

The heaviest spell of rain on Tuesday in central China's Henan Province caused severe damage to Zhengzhou City and Luoyang City, where cultural relics are concentrated.

As a result, water has seeped into a few museums and archaeological sites. For example, in Zhengzhou Shang City archaeological site, Longmen Grottoes, Shaolin Temple, and other places, the protective soil layer of the buildings and sites collapsed a little, but the cultural relics themselves are temporarily safe.

In response, cultural relics departments across Henan Province are making all-out efforts to ensure cultural relics and personnel safety."
A look at influential figures around historical city of Changsha,"Changsha, capital of central China's Hunan Province, and its surrounding areas together make up a piece of legendary land that has nurtured many influential figures throughout history. From late Chinese leader Mao Zedong, one of the founders of the People's Republic of China, to today's super social platform WeChat's creator Zhang Xiaolong, prominent figures from different generations, who were born or lived in this city, demonstrate the depth of this city's history and talented people. To know this city, we have to know these great personalities.

Mao Zedong

Mao, one of the most influential Chinese figures in the 20th century, was born in Shaoshan, a county-level city in Hunan Province. However, another Hunan city should not be neglected in his life: Changsha, where he spent over five years studying and working at Hunan First Normal University. The university is regarded as the cradle of the New Culture Movement (1915-1923) in Hunan, according to the official website of Hunan First Normal University.

Many notable intellectuals and historical leaders have studied or taught pupils here from 1912 to 1949. The institution not only shaped China's normal education, but it also possesses a high place in Chinese culture and revolution history. The former site of the university was opened to the public in 1963 and has received over 20 million visitors from home and abroad ever since. In 1925, Mao, in his early 30s, penned the well-known poem ""Changsha: To the tune of Chin Yuan Chun"" on the Orange Island in the city to describe his lofty goals. The poem is regarded as one of Mao's best, and as a result, it has become Changsha's regional identity. A huge statue of Mao has been set up on Orange Island to honor him and the red history of this city.

Zeng Guofan

Zeng was a Chinese statesman, military leader, and Confucian scholar of the Late Qing Dynasty (1840-1912). He formed the Xiang Army, also known as the Hunan Army, from Hunan Province's local village militia forces. The local force was reputed for its combat power, and became the backbone of the new Qing military structure and has far-reaching implications for the rest of the country.

Zeng was one of the forward-looking officials with the dying Qing government. He spearheaded the country's new wave to usher the technological advancement of the Western world and tried to learn from the Western powers in building up a modern army and military manufacturing industry.



Zeng was also a great advocate of Confucius philosophies, trying to apply the traditional thinking to his life and politics. In addition to his military significance, he perfectly combined the essence of Confucianism, legalism and Taoism, and his philosophy is still influencing people today.

Tan Sitong

Tan Sitong is a well-known late Qing Dynasty reformist, politician, and thinker who were born in Changsha. He was one of the six founders of the Hundred Days' Reform, a 103-day reform effort with the emperor in 1898 that was aimed at introducing Western political and social systems to revive the aging dynasty. But the program ended tragically. Tan was executed at the age of 33.

When he was advised to flee after the reform failed, he refused and said he would sacrifice himself to awaken more people. In the face of death, his calm, steadfast, and awe-inspiring spirit continues to inspire Chinese people.

Lei Feng

Lei Feng has been an iconic figure in China for his selfless, unwavering loyalty and devotion to the country. He has become a symbol of Good Samaritan and is still taught at schools and kindergartens as a role model to help others selflessly. The nation on March 5 celebrates the day as ""Learn from Lei Feng Day"" to remember his virtues. Lei was born in Changsha in 1940, and joined the Communist Party of China (CPC) in 1954. He died at the age of 22, from an accident, in which he was hit by a telephone pole.

Hunan Leifeng Memorial Hall in Changsha is one of the must-visit spots in the city, which receives over 2.1 million tourists annually, according to the official website of the memorial hall. There are Leifeng Subdistrict and Changsha Leifeng School which are also named after the hero in the city.

Ouyang Yuqian

Ouyang Yuqian is the founding president of the Central Academy of Drama, the first higher educational institution of drama in the country. He was born in Liuyang City of Hunan Province, performed in Changsha after graduation and began to gain fame. Ouyang has many titles: playwright, Peking Opera actor and writer, film screenwriter and director, and drama educator.

To honor his artistic achievements, the local government raised fund to build the Ouyang Yuqian Grand Theater in Liuyang City, which was opened in 2002.

Tan Dun

Born in Changsha in 1957, Chinese-American musician Tan Dun received the 73rd Academy Awards for Best Original Score and the 44th Grammy Award for Best Score Soundtrack Album for his work on the award-winning film ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon."" He is considered as a contemporary classical composer, performer, and conductor.

He is a master of traditional Chinese music and has also studied Western music. His diverse upbringing gave him the ability to create works that bridge the divide between traditional and non-classical art, as well as East and West.

Zhang Xiaolong

Zhang Xiaolong, also known as Allen Zhang, is dubbed the ""father of WeChat,"" the Chinese multi-purpose messaging app that has over 1.24 billion monthly active users in the first quarter of 2021, according to statista.com.

About 50 pieces of Yonghe Temple style thangkas on display in Beijing,"01:26

An exhibition titled ""The Collection of Thangka: Masterpieces of Yonghe Lamasery Style,"" aiming to spread thangka's aesthetics and skills to the public, kicked off on Sunday at Poly Art Museum in Beijing. The exhibition showcases more than 50 works of Yonghe Temple thangkas from the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911), displaying the function of these thangkas both for worshipping and decoration.

Thangka is a Lamaist scroll painting on cotton or silk with mineral and organic pigments derived from coral, agate, sapphire, pearl, gold, and others that help preserve the colors for centuries.

The thangka paintings date back to the 7th century and typically depict Buddhist deities. A thangka can be seen in every monastery and family shrine in Tibet Autonomous Region. In 2006, China listed thangka as a national cultural heritage. UNESCO inscribed thangka as an Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity in 2009.

Thangka is an indispensable form in Lamaism. In the Qing Dynasty, the Yonghe Temple, also known as Yonghe Lamasery, became the imperial Tibetan Buddhist temple in Beijing. Based on its important religious status and influence, the thangka art of the Yonghe Temple was greatly developed and formed a unique artistic style.

There is a variety of thangkas preserved in the Yonghe Temple, totaling more than 2,000. These thangkas are appreciated together with the Buddha statues by visitors, and they also serve to decorate the hall.

Compared with the Mongolian and palace styles, Yonghe Temple thangka has its unique consideration of color and theme. They are highlighted by the multi-layered color from the sky to the ground and the rich and diverse landscape to render the background, according to Luo Wenhua, researcher with the Palace Museum. Also, Yonghe Temple thangkas are very decorative, adding solemnness to the temple.

In addition, this kind of thangka is brightly colored. In the process of the paintings, the painter likes to use orange-yellow and bright green, and the use of green is also different from the traditional green in the Tibetan-style thangka. ""This may be related to the use of pigments imported from the West,"" Luo added.

Thangka themes at this exhibition cover almost all categories of the Lamaism and are very widely represented in the expression of Buddhist content. According to Huang Chunhe, researcher from the Capital Museum, the exhibition shows the artistic style and painting features of Yonghe Temple thangkas in a comprehensive way.

The thangkas on display were mainly provided by the descendants of Xu Yingkui (1830-1903), who were in charge of the military and civilian affairs in today's Fujian and Zhejiang provinces between 1898 and 1903. During his tenure in the imperial court, he often accompanied Empress Dowager Cixi (1835-1908) to the Buddhist Hall in the palace or Yonghe Temple in the capital to burn incense and worship Buddha. After the death of Xu, the collections were handed over to his family and have been well preserved to this day. It's for the first time that Xu's collections are displayed publicly.

The exhibition runs until July 30.

Xinjiang Muslims start celebrating Corban Festival,"Muslims in China have started celebrating the annual Corban Festival, also known as Eid al-Adha or the feast of the sacrifice.



Local Muslims usually start preparing for this important festival half a month in advance, cleaning their houses, preparing special food and purchasing new clothes for the celebrations.



""Before sunrise on Corban Festival, we will take a shower and dress ourselves in new clothes. We will visit the tombs of our loved ones. Then we will go to mosques to take part in special rituals. People will also dance to music in celebration,"" said Yakupjan Yalkun, a resident from Kashgar, northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.

Other Muslims also shared their stories of festivities at a press conference in the region's capital Urumqi on Tuesday.

Abduxukur Rahmatulla, an imam of a mosque, showed a video of local Muslims attending morning rituals, saying some Western media's accusations about religious freedom restrictions are groundless.



""In Xinjiang, every citizen has the freedom to believe or not to believe in religion. Believers and non-believers respect each other. Religious venues are open to the public, and believers can go there freely,"" said Abduxukur Rahmatulla. ""In order to make the venues more comfortable, the government has invested a lot, and they've been equipped with air conditioners, water fountains, televisions and other things.""



Watching the Corban Festival Gala with family is also a local tradition. The gala's director Mihray Ebrayim said she hopes the audience can enjoy this year's performances, as much effort has been put into the event.



""This year's gala has various performances, including pieces of Uygur music, Tajik dances, acrobatics, sketch comedies and more. The stage is also very beautiful. I hope the audience will have a blast,"" said Mihray Ebrayim.



Elijan Anayat, a spokesperson for the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, said during the three-day holiday, the local government will guarantee ample food and necessities for residents, with shopping malls and markets bringing out all kinds of treats for the festival."

"Reporter's Diary: Speaking to two families in Hotan, Xinjiang","CGTN reporter Wei Lynn Tang with Mamattohti Nazar's lovely family at their home in Hotan, northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. /CGTN CGTN reporter Wei Lynn Tang with Mamattohti Nazar's lovely family at their home in Hotan, northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. /CGTN

It's about the simple things in life¡­ the little things. This is what I have come to find after speaking to locals in Xinjiang. I had the chance to sit down with two families in Hotan, a town in the southwestern part of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. Let's begin with family number one We were welcomed with a local herbal tea (said to be good for digestion after devouring those meat kebabs), plates and plates of fruits (but of course), walnuts, pistachios, and more flat-baked bread ""naan""¡­ A feast not just for one's stomach but also one's eyes. But what really struck me when stepping foot into Mamattohti Nazar's tastefully done-up home (he's an architect) was how warm, open, and just accepting his family was to a bunch of strangers. I spent over an hour observing how his family interacts with one another, how they truly enjoy playing with their four dogs (bred for fighting purposes), while in between slotting in some questions for him and his children. They plant their own vegetables and rear chickens, which laid the eggs that were set out in the living room. Self-sufficiency. ""I feel contented and blessed. There is nothing for me to complain about,"" Mamattohti, 39, earnestly told me, pointing to his wife and kids.

His eldest son, Yakup Mamattohti, turns 16 this year. A very shy chap, as I was told he doesn't very often meet foreigners. But when I started asking him about his hobbies, of which basketball ranks top, his face lights up. Yakup's idol? Kobe Bryant. ""He has Kobe's posters plastered all over his room,"" his dad teased. I asked Yakup why he likes Kobe. ""His three-pointers,"" he said, adding that he was very sad when Kobe passed away. I proceeded to ask Yakup what was his ambition. ""I want to be a policeman,"" he said, adding, ""I want to catch bad people."" He was inspired by watching Hong Kong dramas when he was little. Each of Nazar's children has their own hobbies and talents. His 13-year-old daughter, Nursiman Mamattohti, wants to be a singer when she grows up. ""Is that okay with you?"" I asked her father. He said it is, knowing full well that his daughter has the looks to boot with her voice. On my second request, Nursiman sang me a beautiful Chinese song in full.

The family speaks Uygur at home, but among the siblings, they speak a mixture of Uygur and Mandarin. It's now the summer holidays and all four children are at home. Family number two: Now a happy jade livestreamer Ahmattohti Tohtiniyaz, 30, was very excited as he welcomed us to his lovely home with his wife and two children. He livestreams every night from 8:30 p.m. until midnight, selling jade he procured from the local market to consumers and businesses all around China, online. He has been doing this for over a year. ""I can speak good Mandarin now and this has been so important. In the past, I would make losses because I didn't really understand the language and was at a disadvantage when it came to negotiating, and I would get mixed up with the prices we agreed on,"" he told us.

Ahmattohti Tohtiniyaz speaks good Mandarin, which has been helpful to his livestream business. Wei Lynn Tang/CGTN Ahmattohti Tohtiniyaz speaks good Mandarin, which has been helpful to his livestream business. Wei Lynn Tang/CGTN

Ahmattohti shared that he only fully learned Mandarin during his nine-month stint in a vocational education and training center, which lasted from September 2018 to May 2019. ""I used to hang out with some friends who sell jade. From them, I was influenced with extreme religious ideas. They said we can't sell jade to atheists, and that we can't interact with them. At that point, my business dropped, and I would quarrel with my wife when I went home every day,"" he told me later. ""Once my mother found out about my strange behavior, she mentioned that the government had opened a school and it's free of charge. She advised me to head there to study for a bit, to eliminate these 'religious extremism' thoughts of mine."" Ahmattohti said he then volunteered to go to the vocational education and training center. ""There, I studied law, Mandarin and skills. As you can see, I am now very happy. So it's a good thing I attended the center at that point, else I would not be as happy as I am now,"" he said.

Ahmattohti said he now makes 20,000 yuan ($3,000) a month. ""I have 5,000-6,000 followers on Douyin (the Chinese version of TikTok),"" Ahmattohti proudly said. Dancing and singing on the Banlange grasslands One of my favorite moments in this work trip has got to be: dancing and singing with a local family we met randomly on the Banlange grasslands in Qira County, Hotan. I am usually very shy when it comes to dancing. But the moment just simply called for it, and I joined the mother to dance to local Uygur folk music playing in the background. At an altitude of about 3,500 meters above sea level on grasslands facing the Kunlun Mountains, it was a moment so beautiful I almost had a tear.

And when I politely declined their offer to have some of their food, the mother took it upon her own to feed me grilled lamb. But what also caught my eye was the patriarch of the family. When I told Tohetikuerpan Mamati I couldn't believe he was 81 years old, he showed me his identification card to prove his age ¨C it was a cute moment. He looks 20 years younger than he really is! Previously a road maintenance worker, his advice to me was to get moving every day to keep healthy.

World's largest planetarium opens in Shanghai,"00:36

The Shanghai Astronomy Museum, the world's largest planetarium, officially opened on Saturday and will welcome the public starting Sunday. Covering approximately 58,600 square meters, the museum is located in the China (Shanghai) Pilot Free Trade Zone Lingang Special Area. It is a branch of the Shanghai Science and Technology Museum (SSTM). The museum features innovative architecture, exhibition areas with various themes, immersive technologies, and precious collections.

Architectural feature Viewed from the air, the museum's main building looks like a super bowl of astronomical instruments with a circular skylight, an inverted spherical dome, and a dome theater. Like the mechanism of sundials, a light spot on the ground changes as sunlight shines through the circular skylight and will be a perfect circle on the noon of the Summer Solstice, the day with the longest hours of daylight in the Northern Hemisphere. Xihe Tower and Wangshu Tower, named after the symbols of the sun and the moon in ancient Chinese mythology, respectively, stand like satellites of the main building. During the daytime, visitors can observe the sun through the educational adaptive-optics solar telescope in the Xihe Tower and see high-definition images of sunspots and solar flares. At night, a double-focus, one-meter telescope, the largest in China in terms of aperture, allows visitors to in the Wangshu Tower to enjoy views of the moon, planets, and celestial bodies in deep space.

Immersive and interactive The opening of the Shanghai Astronomy Museum is a milestone for the efforts to promote science, as Shanghai now owns museums on nature, modern technology, and astronomy, said Wang Lianhua, in charge of the SSTM. Touring in the main building, visitors can gain a thorough understanding of the universe through three themed exhibitions, including Home, Cosmos, and Odyssey. Many other facilities focus on topics such as the history of Chinese research on astronomy, the exploration of Mars, and science popularization for children. An 8K-resolution spherical projection system, with an advanced laser performance system and a stage performance system, is installed in the dome theater, where visitors can enjoy shows about the latest developments in astronomy. The museum's exhibits include approximately 70 meteorites, covering those from the moon, Mars, and Vesta, as well as over 120 collections of artifacts such as the works of Isaac Newton, Galileo Galilei, and Johannes Kepler. Among the over 300 exhibits in the museum, interactive exhibits account for more than 50 percent. Technologies such as data visualization, augmented reality, virtual reality, and biometrics technologies help visitors gain astronomical and scientific knowledge through interaction.

Inspiration for the future ""China has made fruitful explorations in deep space in the 21st century,"" said Ye Shuhua, an astronomer and member of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Ye has made efforts over the decades to help establish the Shanghai Astronomy Museum. It is significant to build a planetarium to popularize astronomical science knowledge and support the education of young people in the field, she said. China has witnessed a fever for science fiction and astronomy. In 2019, the total output value of China's science fiction industry was 65.87 billion yuan ($10.17 billion), up by 44.3 percent year on year. The box office of domestic science fiction films has doubled from 2018. Sixty-nine percent of young Chinese people surveyed recently by the China Youth Daily felt the spirit and achievements made during China's manned exploration of space were encouraging and inspiring. ""I feel like following the path of space explorations of generations of Chinese people. We are witnessing China embarking on a new space journey,"" said Wang Lu, a visitor from Shanghai, after watching replica models of China's Chang'e-5 probe, the Mars rover Zhurong, and the space station core module Tianhe. ""I was privileged to be part of the early stage of the museum project, and wish all the success in inspiring future generations with stories about us and the universe,"" said Thomas Kraupe, director of Planetarium Hamburg and former president of the International Planetarium Society.

Reporter's Diary in Xinjiang: Fruits for days!,"Two words: Sore throat. Yes, two days into my first trip to Xinjiang and the little devil is already acting up. And if I were to play the blame game I'd pin it on the fruits I've been consuming. Glucose, sucrose, fructose ¡­ sugar overload! But I know that there's only one to blame here, and that is me. I just couldn't resist trying all the fresh fruits produced here in China's northwest. Aksu Prefecture ¨C our first stop ¨C offered a wide variety of fruits, as it is one of the country's major fruit production centers.

A fruit shop in Aksu, Xinjiang sells different sorts of domestic and imported produce. Chuck Tinte/CGTN A fruit shop in Aksu, Xinjiang sells different sorts of domestic and imported produce. Chuck Tinte/CGTN

Aksu's fertile soil, long sunlight hours (yes, the sun is up until 9 p.m.), and large temperature differences between day and night all contribute to the accumulation of sugar in fruits, making them sweeter and juicier. After checking in at Aksu State Guest Hotel, my team and I wandered around. We saw and tried all sorts. Well, not all of course ¡­ just those in season and some that are available all-year round: Hotan jujube, Xinjiang fig, apricot, flat peach, watermelon, the seedless Turpan grape and the famed Hami gua or melon.

Fruits are served by a fruits company in Wensu County, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, China. Yu Chuan/CGTN Fruits are served by a fruits company in Wensu County, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, China. Yu Chuan/CGTN

But it's not the variety of fruits that fascinate me, to be honest. It's how much of a melting pot of cultures Xinjiang is. I've been living in China for over five years now. But it's only now that I've actually seen and experienced a multi-ethnic China.

The region is inhabited by over 50 ethnic groups. From signs in Mandarin and Uygur language to a stretch of food stalls selling Hui and Kazakh dishes: it's fascinating to see them live alongside each other. There's a certain warmth you feel around them as well. At least with the few interactions I've had with locals ¨C they're all very welcoming.

In Wensu County, a major fruit producer, we were given a slice of the sweet, fruity life ¨C yes lots of fruits ¨C and shown a sense of community. Our first stop there was at the Kekeya Green Project. It's dubbed China's great green wall. It's located at the northwestern edge of the country's largest desert, the Taklimakan. It was established back in 1986, aimed at tackling harsh weather conditions, most especially frequent sandstorms.

And the initiative has been successful in protecting the area against desertification. Officials give credit not only to the project's forest rangers, but the residents' efforts in helping plant trees and turn the desert into an oasis.

We also visited an apple farm. There I met Zhou Fengxia. She was busy that day, though. We caught her and her husband speaking in front of multiple phones. They were live-streaming. They promoted their produce, which were up for pre-orders three months before harvest season.

When I got the chance to talk to her, she told me that her efforts on digital platforms were not just for her own benefit. She said she takes advantage of the platform to help promote other growers' produce as well. Known as Xinjiang girl on Taobao, she's become a pro at live-streaming and is now helping train her fellow growers.

Learning more about Aksu and its locals made me miss my home, the Philippines. Filipinos exemplify, to the best of our abilities, what we call bayanihan. It's a term derived from the word bayan, which means nation, town or community, and bayanihan which literally means to be in a bayan. The whole concept refers to the spirit of communal or civic unity to achieve a common goal.

Growing up in a rural area myself, I saw firsthand how bayanihan worked. You'd see neighbors help plough one's farm, or even carry a person's hut and relocate it from one place to another. I guess this is a quality that I felt beaming from the locals here. Their hospitality and generosity made me feel quite at home ¨C homey enough that when they learned I was reeling from a sore throat, they were quick to teach me the antidote: the watermelon.

"Season's greetings: Sunflower, for whom you emit fragrance","You are a sunflower, With golden pistils and stamens, For whom you emit fragrance, For whom you bend not. The beautiful song sung by the late pop queen Teresa Teng depicts people's affection for the sunflower. Native to South America, sunflower was introduced to China in the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644), originally for ornamental use. With tall figure, big flower and bright yellow color, the flower always give people a strong impression on its beauty. It is recorded that in the middle of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912), sunflower had been widely planted in eastern and northwestern China. But it was no longer just for appreciation then, but for more of its functions.

At the time, Chinese people believe more children bring more blessings. Since sunflower has many seeds, people liked to plant a few sunflowers in the courtyard in front of or in the backyard of their house, in a good wish that the flower could bring more children to the family. The sunflower has also been treated as oil crop and planted in larger areas since then. Used for daily cook, sunflower seed oil can supplement the essential vitamins and beta carotenes of human body. And since the early 20th century, the fried sunflower seeds have even been replaced pumpkin seeds and watermelon seeds to become one of the most popular snacks nationwide.

Quanzhou's application on the agenda

During this year's session, the ancient port city of Quanzhou, about 180 kilometers from Fuzhou, will be assessed for World Heritage status, as China proposed the item of ""Quanzhou: Emporium of the World in Song-Yuan China"" to the Committee earlier in 2019. Quanzhou, also known as Zayton overseas, was one of the world's largest and busiest ports during the Song (960-1279) and Yuan (1271-1368) dynasties, and now is home to more than eight million inhabitants, as well as numerous cultural relics and religious sites, such as Qingjing Mosque, one of the oldest mosques in the country, and the Twin Stone Pagodas at Kaiyuan Temple, which are the highest pair among China's stone pagodas. Located in the south of Fujian Province, the ancient city is believed to be the starting point of ancient Maritime Silk Road route in China and an important exchange hub for different civilizations.

The application features a total of 22 sites in Quanzhou, including temples, port ruins, ancient bridges and a porcelain kiln. ""We've remained cautiously optimistic about the prospects of the application,"" said Zhang Lei, head of the World Cultural Heritage Bureau under the National Cultural Heritage Administration. It is the second time Quanzhou has applied for inclusion on the World Heritage List. At the 42nd session in 2018, the Committee ""deferred"" the application of ""Historic Monuments and Sites of Ancient Quanzhou (Zayton)"" and requested more comprehensive and supplementary information about the sites.

Reporter's Diary: Overdose of fruits and my favorite Aksu person,"CGTN's reporter Wei Lynn Tang at Awat County, Aksu Prefecture, northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. /CGTN CGTN's reporter Wei Lynn Tang at Awat County, Aksu Prefecture, northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. /CGTN

Ever felt like you might have an overdose of fruits?



I think I might be experiencing just that ¨C into Day 5 of our trip in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. Fruits alone do keep you very full. Speaking to locals, I understand this is why they also have their local staple naan (baked flat bread) to balance out this heavy-fiber diet. I've heard a lot about how watermelons in Xinjiang are huge and tasty; but I gotta say, I am thus far mostly fascinated by the taste of peaches here ¨C they are naturally sweet and absolutely succulent.



One really nice spontaneous moment I had: plucking a ripe flat peach (that looks like a donut, mind you) from a tree and consuming it right away. Some may ask if it's okay to eat the peaches without first washing them¡­ Well, I did, and so far my stomach feels a-okay. This was in Garden Town in Shihezi City, a two-hour drive from Urumqi, the capital of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.



Guo Hongzhong, the local Party secretary told me there are two ways to know if peaches are ready for picking: firstly, if they are red enough in color and secondly, if they feel soft enough. These peach trees pollinate in April and their fruits are harvested in August.

Then there's those famous Aksu apples.



A couple was selling fruits of all sorts via livestreaming when we arrived at Longkou Village in Kekeya Town, Wensu County, Aksu. I was told Aksu apples will only ripen in October, so buyers are currently locking in pre-orders.



The husband hails from Anhui Province, while the wife is from Xinjiang. They have been livestreaming on Taobao, one of China's biggest e-commerce platforms, for five to six years now.



When I asked about the future of this industry, Zhou Fengxia, the husband, said: ""The way forward for livestreams will be to allow our audience to tune into the entire production process ¨C from planting up until harvesting of the fruits ¨C they can monitor the steps anytime.""



And when I asked his wife, Li Jing, what the main changes she's found in the industry over the years, she said: ""The demands and requirements of the future and younger generation are higher. They are more discerning. If, say, they find our fruits to be not of quality, they will complain or leave a comment on social media. This has pushed us to keep up with standards.""



Both Zhou and Li have their own fruit farm, but they also help other farms sell their products via livestreaming, and earn a share from the profits made.

Meet 76-year-old Imam Mamat

But this post isn't going to be just about fruits. I also want to write about some of the people I've met so far.



Let me begin with 76-year-old Imam Mamat, who served as the very first station director of the mega Aksu Desert Greening Project. The project started in 1986, and he joined in March 1987. Throughout the years, he watched and guided workers as they transformed the barren land of the Gobi Desert ¨C all 1.2 million mu or about 198,000 acres of it ¨C to what it is today: a land suitable for vegetation greening.



According to information obtained from locals, before the 1980s, Aksu City and Wensu County were surrounded by the Gobi Desert, which was only 6 kilometers away from the nearest urban area.



""Back then, there wasn't a single grass here at all. There was sandstorm, it was super windy, we can't even see each other properly,"" Imam Mamat told us.



""The height above sea level in this part of the forest is higher than that of the city center, so if we can build greeneries here, it can block the sandstorm from reaching the city.""

Imam Mamat said his son and daughter both work at the local forestry institute in different roles, and hopes his grandchildren will be able to work here too. ""Everything in the world comes from oxygen, and oxygen comes from trees. People, animals, we all can't live without oxygen.""



Even though he's retired, he still has strong feelings towards the forest. ""It's like my child, I still come back often.""



On the sidelines, I just had to ask him for some life advice for our younger generation. (Trust our conversation to turn into something life-related!)



Imam Mamat said, firstly, we need to take care of our health. ""Having a good and optimistic mindset is important. Don't get angry, stay happy everyday. It's also important to exercise and adjust your diet accordingly.""



""Respect is first gained by giving another respect. It's also considered a form of self-respect,"" he added.



(He was speaking mostly in the Uygur language, so thank you Akpar for translating them into Mandarin Chinese for me.)

Tourism industry criticizes UK travel list changes,"02:35

Large parts of the travel industry have criticized the UK government's latest changes to its traffic-light system for travel. Only two destinations have been added to its green list, which requires no quarantine on arrival in the UK ¨C Bulgaria and Hong Kong. UK travelers are currently banned from entering Hong Kong over fears they may bring in the Delta variant. In other changes, tourist hotspot the Balearic Islands ¨C which include Ibiza, Majorca and Menorca ¨C will move back onto the tougher amber list, which currently means 10 days of self-isolation at home on return to the UK. Four other nations ¨C Cuba, Indonesia, Myanmar and Sierra Leone ¨C will be classified as red.

All of the above changes come into effect from 3 a.m. GMT on Monday July 19. Virginia Messina, managing director of the World Travel and Tourism Council said the constant changes were putting people off booking trips. ""I think the challenge we have is all these changing rules, because that is what is really undermining consumer confidence. We are really at a peak season when it comes to travel, particularly in regions like Europe and the UK, so the next six weeks are really significant."" Many in the travel sector want to see more places added to the green list, particularly given that many locations have lower infection rates than the UK. On Wednesday, there were more than 42,000 cases recorded in the country, the highest figure since mid-January and the numbers are expected to continue rising sharply. The UK government predicts there will be 100,000 cases a day later in the summer."
"Toxic gas, new rivers of molten lava endanger Spanish island","As a new volcanic vent blew open and unstoppable rivers of molten rock flowed toward the sea, authorities on a Spanish island warned Tuesday that more dangers lie ahead for residents, including earthquakes, lava flows, toxic gases, volcanic ash and acid rain. Several small earthquakes shook the island of La Palma in the Atlantic Ocean off northwest Africa on Tuesday, keeping nerves on edge after a volcanic eruption on Sunday. The island, with a population of 85,000, is part of the Canary Islands archipelago, a key tourist destination for Europeans.

Authorities said the new fissure demonstrated that the area was unstable and unsafe and kept people at least 2 kilometers away. The rivers of lava, up to six meters high, rolled down hillsides, burning and crushing everything in their path as they gradually closed in on the island's more densely populated coast. One was bearing down on Todoque, where more than 1,000 people live and where emergency services were preparing evacuations. So far, the eruption has destroyed around 190 houses and forced the evacuation of 6,000 people. ""The truth is that it's a tragedy to see people losing their properties,"" said municipal worker Fernando D¨ªaz in the town of El Paso.

The lava's advance has slowed to about 120 meters an hour, according to the head of the Canary Island Volcanic Emergency Plan, Miguel ?ngel Morcuende, and wasn't expected to reach the Atlantic Ocean before Wednesday. Canary Islands government chief ?ngel V¨ªctor Torres said ""when (the lava) reaches the sea, it will be a critical moment."" The meeting of the lava, whose temperature exceeds 1,000 degrees Celsius, with a body of water could cause explosions and produce clouds of toxic gas. Torres asked locals to remember the island's last eruption in 1971, when one person died after inhaling the gas emitted as lava met the water. A change in the wind direction blew the ashes from the volcano across a vast area on the western side of the island, with the black particles blanketing everything. Volcanic ash is an irritant for the eyes and lungs. The volcano has also been spewing out between 8,000 and 10,500 tonnes of sulfur dioxide ¨C which also affects the lungs ¨C every day, the Volcanology Institute said. Adding to the dangers, the emergence of new cracks in the earth spewing lava cannot be ruled out, said Nemesio P¨¦rez, head of the Canary Islands Volcanology Institute, who noted there is ""important superficial seismic activity in the area.""

The new fissure that appeared Monday night is 900 meters north of the Cumbre Vieja ridge, where the volcano first erupted Sunday after a week of thousands of small earthquakes. That earthquake swarm warned authorities that an eruption was likely and allowed many people to be evacuated, avoiding casualties. The new fissure opened after what the Canary Islands Volcanology Institute said was a magnitude-3.8 quake. Scientists say the lava flows could last for weeks or months. Torres described the lava-hit region as a ""catastrophe zone"" and said he would request money to rebuild roads, water pipes and create temporary accommodations for families who have lost their homes and farmland. Spain's King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia are to visit the area on Thursday.

Critically endangered baby Siamese crocodiles seen in Cambodia,"Eight baby Siamese crocodiles, one of the world's rarest crocodile species, have been found in a wildlife sanctuary in eastern Cambodia. Cambodia's environment ministry said the discovery could become a milestone as it could be used to reverse biodiversity loss and aid in the restoration of globally significant wildlife.

Siamese Crocodile (Crocodylus siamensis) has been listed as ""critically endangered"" on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species. It was once a common species across Southeast Asia but suddenly disappeared during the early 1990s. According to IUCN, global populations have been severely reduced, almost certainly by over 80 percent in the past 75 years, principally due to hunting."

FILE PIC: The Horn of Africa region could experience widespread hunger and malnutrition in the last quarter of this year amid a prolonged dry spell, the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) said on Tuesday. /AFP

The Horn of Africa region could experience widespread hunger and malnutrition in the last quarter of this year amid a prolonged dry spell, the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) said on Tuesday.

According to IGAD's latest analysis on the escalating food insecurity in the region, about 36.7 to 37.2 million people will likely grapple with acute hunger in the near future due to shocks linked to conflicts, extreme weather events, and the COVID-19 pandemic.

Workneh Geneyehu, executive secretary of IGAD said the Horn of Africa region comprises 20 percent of the highly food insecure global population, hence the need for urgent interventions to avert a humanitarian crisis.

""There is a need for us to initiate a paradigm shift to a longer-term view that inspires us to come up with coherent, coordinated, and cost-effective development investments that target the root causes of food crises in our region,"" Geneyehu said in a statement issued in Nairobi.

He noted that the latest weather forecast in the region points to a drier than usual October to December season, leading to crop failure, water stress and competition for pasture among herders.

Three countries in the Horn of Africa region including Sudan, Ethiopia and South Sudan are currently among the ten worst global food insecurity hotspots, according to IGAD analysis.

In addition, nearly 79 percent of IGAD region's population facing severe hunger crisis is from the three countries, with Sudan, Ethiopia and South Sudan accounting for 9.6 million, 8.6 million and 6.5 million respectively.

David Phiri, Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) sub regional coordinator for Eastern Africa said that governments should invest in climate-resilient farming systems, extension services, peacebuilding and early warning to limit the impact of recurrent droughts on livelihoods.

""Market access, anticipatory and emergency humanitarian response to crises must remain at the core of our collective response to build and protect farmer's resilience to shocks,"" said Phiri.

Michael Dunford, World Food Program Regional Director for Eastern Africa said there was an urgency to extend support to vulnerable communities affected by food and water scarcity."

Bees kill dozens of endangered penguins in South Africa,"A swarm of bees has killed 63 endangered African penguins on a beach outside Cape Town, the Southern African Foundation for the Conservation of Coastal Birds said on Sunday.

African penguins, which inhabit the coast and islands of southern Africa, are on the International Union for Conservation of Nature's red list, meaning they face a high risk of extinction.

The death of these penguins is a very rare occurrence. ""After tests, we found bee stings around the penguins' eyes,"" said the foundation's David Roberts, a clinical veterinarian. And dead bees were also found on the scene.

The protected birds, found on Friday, were from a colony at Simonstown, a small town near Cape Town. The area is a national park, and the Cape honey bees are part of the ecosystem. ""The penguins ... must not die just like that as they are already in danger of extinction. They are a protected species,"" said Roberts.

The South African National Parks said the birds were taken to the foundation for post-mortems and samples sent for disease and toxicology testing. ""There were no external physical injuries found on any of the birds,"" a park statement said. The post-mortems showed all the penguins had multiple bee stings.

Technology helps reveal more about Tibetan antelopes,"A Chinese expedition team members have found four new breeding areas of Tibetan antelopes, each holding 2,000 to 4,000 antelopes, in northwest China's Tibet Autonomous Region with the help of an intelligent video surveillance system.

Tibetan antelopes is a species under first-class state protection in China and mostly found in Tibet Autonomous Region, Qinghai Province and Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.

The scientists, from the Shaanxi Institute of Zoology, have been monitoring the migration of the species by using the BeiDou Navigation Satellite System and the 4G wireless transmission technology in the Qiangtang National Nature Reserve in Tibet's Xainza County since May.

After field research, they installed monitor devices in the core calving area, which extended six to seven kilometers wide and 20 kilometers long to conduct regular observation.

According to their observation, the calving area hosted more than 4,000 pregnant antelopes in June and the lambing period lasted between 15 to 20 days, said Wu Xiaomin, a researcher from the Shaanxi Provincial Institute of Zoology.

""The area where we are right now is very flat. There are snow mountains around the breeding grounds, so they are rich in water resources. For Tibetan antelopes, the main natural enemy in this area is wolves. If a wolf comes to this area to attack the Tibetan antelopes, this flat area is relatively easy for them to escape. Even if they cannot escape, there will not be too many casualties,"" he said.

The antelope population was calculated using the system's data-processing software, said Wu. The software divided the ground into grids and counted the antelopes with the help of infrared camera recognition and then sent the data to the mobile and laptop terminals for further investigation.

""We will conduct a systematic monitoring to figure out how many antelopes give births here, how long they stay here, and in which direction they will go for return,"" he said.

The scientists have found that the Tibetan antelopes living in the area have kept close contacts with local herdsmen and their livestock. Therefore, they have developed some new characteristics that are rarely seen on other Tibetan antelope population. For example, some Tibetan antelopes gave birth to their babies in front of or even in the crowd of the livestock.

And after the baby antelopes were born, the mother would keep close to them, which is a very unusual behavior for Tibetan antelopes, Wu said.

""This phenomenon is somewhat different from the calving process of Tibetan antelopes we observed in the past. In the past, we saw in other breeding area that the mothers would leave the babies after they gave birth. Probably due to the impact of their natural enemies, the antelopes were very sensitive to the surrounding environment. They would leave their newborns on the ground, and the babies' fur is a natural camouflage. In addition, the newborns can stand up and run very fast within two hours,"" he said."
The Great Herbs: Female ginseng,"Legend has it that in ancient times there was a young man named Wang Fu who lived with his mother and made a living by farming and collecting medicine. Hundreds of kilometers away from home, there was a huge mountain, said to grow many magical herbs, but few people dared to go there because of the rough roads, poisonous snakes and wild animals. Fu wanted to go up the mountain to find the magic medicine, but his mother advised him to go after marriage. Fu followed his mother's wishes. One day after his marriage, his neighbors talked about him behind his back, saying that he was too timid to go to the mountain. When the word reached Fu's ears, he made up his mind to explore the mountain. Fu said to his wife, ""If I don't return after three years, you can marry another man."" The next day, he went up the mountain.

Three years passed, and Fu hadn't come home. The mother thought he must be dead and advised her daughter-in-law to remarry another man at her son's request. However, less than half a month after the remarriage, he came back with a full load of rare medicinal herbs. After hearing about his wife's remarriage, he was deeply distressed and regretful and gave all the herbs to his wife. From then on, the wife was so sad that she became sick with melancholy and had irregular periods. She was so distressed that she tried to eat the herbs all in an attempt to poison herself to death. Unexpectedly, instead of dying, her periods became regular. The herb Wang Fu picked is called Dong quai (also known as Female ginseng).

In ancient times, Dong quai has the meaning of ""thinking of husband"" since its Chinese name ""Danggui"" is short for ""Ying Dang Gui Lai"" (""should return""), according to ""Compendium of Materia Medica.""

As Li Shizhen wrote in ""Compendium of Materia Medica,"" (Ben Cao Gang Mu) , Dong quai mainly cures headaches, heart and abdominal pain, ulcers, and it has the effect of discharging pus and relieving pain, and replenishing blood. According to the ""Chinese Pharmacy Dictionary,"" it's clinically used in the treatment of diseases such as muscle, joint pain and neuralgia, chronic tracheitis, chronic pelvic inflammatory, menopathy and hypertension."
Volcano erupts on Spanish island of La Palma,"A volcano erupted on the Spanish Canary Island of La Palma on Sunday, the islands' government said.

A huge column of smoke rose up after the eruption at 3:15 p.m. local time (1415 GMT) in the Cumbre Vieja national park in the south of the island, according the Canary Islands government.

Just before the eruption, authorities had evacuated about 40 people with mobility problems and farm animals from the villages around the volcano.

Soldiers were deployed to help with the evacuation, the defense ministry said, and it is expected that more residents will be evacuated from surrounding towns.

Ahead of the eruption, scientists had recorded a series of earthquakes reaching 3.8 magnitude in the national park, according to the Spanish National Geographical Institute (ING).

The earliest recorded volcanic eruption in La Palma took place in 1430, according to the ING.

In the last eruption in 1971, one man was killed when he took photographs near the lava flows but no property was damaged."
Better environment benefits both wildlife and humans in Sichuan,"The growth of the wild giant panda population in Ya'an, southwest China's Sichuan Province indicates their living conditions have been improved and China's efforts to protect their habitats have paid off.



There are more than 50 giant pandas in the Ya'an Bifeng Canyon Panda Base and 1,864 wild pandas, and the numbers continue to grow, according to Huang Zhi, deputy head of Administrative Office, China Conservation and Research Center for Giant Panda.

The population growth is attributed to the efforts to protect giant pandas' habitats.

Since 2019, nine coal mines were closed in Ya'an, phasing out 1.11 million tonnes of coal production capacity. With the improvements in the local ecology, the population of wild giant pandas is also on the rise.

The improved ecology has not only provided local villagers with a better living environment, but also created opportunities to earn more money.

In Ya'an's Zhougongshan Township, towering green stalks form a vast stretch of bamboo sea with an area of nearly 3,300 hectares, purifying the air, conserving the water and soil, and serving as an industry for local villagers to make extra money without leaving home to look for jobs."

Let's take a look at these photos of Yunnan snub-nosed monkeys taken in Baima Snow Mountain Nature Reserve to learn more about the daily life of these lovely creatures."
International Red Panda Day: Protect our cute fluffy friends,"Do you know that red pandas were given the name ""panda"" about 50 years earlier than giant pandas?

Like their black-and-white counterparts, red pandas love bamboo, but they also eat fruit, flowers and eggs. It is said that the name panda comes from the Nepali word ""ponya,"" which means bamboo or plant eating animal.

There are now two distinct red panda species: the Chinese red panda and the Himalayan red panda. They look almost the same. However, Chinese red pandas have redder fur and striped tail rings, while Himalayan pandas have whiter faces. In China, red pandas mostly inhabit the southwestern provinces of Sichuan and Yunnan.

International Red Panda Day is celebrated on the third Saturday of September each year. Classified as endangered on the IUCN Red List, there are fewer than 10,000 red pandas living in the wild with the largest threats listed as poaching and loss of habitat. They are now under second-class state protection in China."

Peppers boost incomes for farmers in NW China's Shaanxi Province,"Growing Sichuan peppers has spiced up the income for farmers in Luanmake Village, which locates in Yan'an City in northwest China's Shaanxi Province over the years.

Sichuan pepper is a popular spice over the country. It is indigenous to Sichuan Province but is also planted in Shaanxi. It is used in authentic Sichuan cuisine in almost every dish from hotpot and soups, to stir-fries and dipping sauces.

Recently, farmers of the village have been busy harvesting the pepper.

""This year, the peppers have good quality. I have hired more than 10 people to harvest the peppers. This year's income is estimated to be 120,000 yuan (about $18,650),"" said Xue Haiwang, a Sichuan pepper farmer.

The village has organized locals to grow the spice because the area happens to have favorable soil and climate conditions for the peppers. In addition, the plant can yield a handsome return at a low cost, according to a local official.

At present, the village has planted over 60 hectares of peppers, which is expected to yield 12,000 kilograms this year."
An Amur tiger undergoes an X-ray on his spine,"Staff at Yorkshire Wildlife Park were relieved when a 12-year-old tiger Vladimir woke up from a risky medical procedure. The big cat has a curve in its spine that causes him discomfort, so to check the problem, he has to be under anaesthetic.

As the procedure could cause the tiger to hallucinate or even stop breathing, the team leader described the process as a ""heart-in-the-throat situation"". The tiger is recovering well from the anaesthetic, and has to undergo a check once a year to make sure his condition has not progressed.

The Amur tiger is one of the word's most endangered animals, and is mainly distributed in the forests of eastern Russia and northeast China. A pilot Northeast China Tiger and Leopard National Park has been built to help bring back the precious feline.

African environment ministers renew support for green recovery,"Environment ministers from the African continent on Thursday pledged mobilization of additional resources to accelerate a post-pandemic recovery that is green and inclusive.

Speaking at the 18th session of the African Ministerial Conference on Environment (AMCEN) that took place virtually, the ministers said that supportive policies, adequate financing and political goodwill is key to place the continent on a green and sustainable recovery pathway.

Barbara Creecy, South African Minister of Environment, Forestry and Fisheries and outgoing president of AMCEN, said that enhanced protection of habitats and climate financing will revitalize Africa's quest for green pandemic recovery.

""We can use environmental sustainability as a vehicle for post COVID-19 recovery in Africa. The continent should adopt green stimulus packages to support its journey towards low carbon growth pathways,"" said Creecy.

The meeting of African environment ministers held under the theme of ""Securing people's well-being and ensuring environmental sustainability in Africa"", was also attended by representatives of multilateral organizations and continental blocs.

Inger Andersen, executive director of UN Environment Program (UNEP) that has served as the secretariat of AMCEN since its inception in 1985, stressed that Africa's ability to overcome pandemic shocks hinges on green investments.

According to Andersen, the continent should enact progressive legislation and policies, promote investments in clean technologies and harness nature-based solutions to accelerate recovery from pandemic-linked economic downturn.

She said that Africa has a chance to rebuild its economies, strengthen climate resilience of communities if governments explore innovative financing toward renewable energy, pollution control and ecosystems restoration.

Abdou Karim Sall, Minister for Environment and Sustainable Development of Senegal and incoming president of AMCEN underscored the critical role of regional cooperation, sharing of best practices and policy harmonization to promote green recovery and restore degraded ecosystems in Africa.

Josefa Leonel Corriea Sacko, commissioner for Agriculture, Rural Development, Blue Economy and Sustainable Environment at the African Union Commission, said that investments in green recovery will unleash multiple benefits including food security, improved health outcomes and greater access to clean energy.

According to Sacko, a green recovery master plan for the continent once implemented fully will boost war against poverty, create new jobs, reduce negative impact of climatic shocks to livelihoods, improve peace and stability.

She said continental blocs have rallied behind green financing to help restore livelihoods devastated by the pandemic and promote climate-resilient development.

Step up climate action by learning from ozone layer protection,"UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Thursday asked the world to step up climate action by learning from the success story of protecting the ozone layer.

""The Montreal Protocol began life as a mechanism to protect and heal the ozone layer. It has done its job well over the past three decades,"" writes Ant¨®nio Guterres in his 2021 message on the UN website. He said that the cooperation we have seen under the Montreal Protocol is exactly what is needed now to take on climate change, an equally existential threat to our societies.

The Montreal Protocol is more than just an example of how multilateralism can and should work, it is an active tool to help meet the global vision for sustainable development, he said in a message for the International Day for the Preservation of the Ozone Layer, which falls on September 16.

Under the Kigali Amendment to the protocol, nations have committed to phasing down hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), powerful greenhouse gases used as coolants. When fully implemented, the Kigali Amendment could prevent 0.4 degrees Celsius of global warming this century, he said.

Furthermore, the Kigali Amendment can also help increase food security. By reducing HFCs, increasing energy efficiency and creating more ozone- and climate-friendly technologies, the Kigali Amendment can bring sustainable access to vital cooling services to millions of people. Such services would reduce food loss in developing countries, where food often spoils before it can reach markets. Getting produce from farmers to consumers would help reduce hunger, poverty and the environmental impact of the agricultural sector, he said.

Another important benefit of expanding cooling is the storage of medicines and vaccines, such as COVID-19 vaccines, he added.

""The Montreal Protocol and the Kigali Amendment show us that by acting together, anything is possible. So let us act now to slow climate change, feed the world's hungry and protect the planet that we all depend on,"" said Guterres.

The world in 2021 was missing the mark of building back sustainably from the COVID-19 crisis and ""not going in the right direction,"" Taalas said.

""There was some thinking that the COVID-19 lockdowns would have had a positive impact on the¡­ atmosphere, which is not the case,"" WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas said at a news briefing.

The virus-related economic downturn caused only a temporary reduction in CO2 emissions and it was not enough to reverse rising levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, according to UN agency the World Meteorological Organization (WMO).

The pace of climate change has not been slowed by the global COVID-19 pandemic and the world remains behind in its battle to cut carbon emissions, the United Nations said on Thursday.

Reduction targets for emissions are not being met and there is a rising likelihood the world will miss its Paris Agreement aim of reducing global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, the WMO said in its United in Science 2021 report.

""This is a critical year for climate action,"" U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in a statement, and the results were an ""alarming appraisal of just how far off course we are.""

""This year has seen fossil fuel emissions bounce back, greenhouse gas concentrations continuing to rise and severe human-enhanced weather events that have affected health, lives and livelihoods on every continent,"" he said.

'Immediate reductions needed'

Concentrations in the atmosphere of the major greenhouse gases - CO2, methane and nitrous oxide - continued to increase in 2020 and the first half of 2021, the UN said.

The average global temperature for the past five years was among the highest on record, estimated at 1.06 degrees Celsius to 1.26 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.

There is now a 40 percent chance that the average global temperature in one of the next five years will be at least 1.5 degrees Celsius warmer than pre-industrial levels, the report said.

""Unless there are immediate, rapid and large-scale reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius will be impossible, with catastrophic consequences for people and the planet on which we depend,"" Guterres said.

The report comes a week after a study by University College London experts, published in Nature, warned that the vast majority of the world's fossil fuel reserves would have to be left in the ground to maintain even a 50/50 chance of hitting the Paris target."

The medium-sized, pale-colored owl has long wings and a short, squarish tail. Females are slightly larger in size than males.

It's also called a monkey-faced owl because of its big round face.

The nocturnal bird can see in daylight, but their pupils don't contract like human eyes, so to block out the extra light, they often close their eyes halfway or more. They might look sleepy or even half asleep, when in fact they are wide awake and alert.

China's National Games aim to achieve carbon neutrality,"China's 14th National Games, which opened on Wednesday night, are expected to achieve the goal of carbon neutrality throughout the 13-day schedule of events, its organizers said.

For the first time in National Games history, China has proposed the goal of carbon neutrality in sports as it advocates green development.

An estimated 200,000 tonnes of carbon emissions will be produced during this year's National Games, scheduled for September 15-27, which will be neutralized through emission reduction, carbon sink and the purchase of Chinese Certified Emission Reductions.

A total of 8,198 industrial sources, 5,207 dust sources, 43,600 mobile sources and 45,000 food and catering sources will be included in the list for air quality control during the Games.

China aims to reach a carbon peak by 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality nationwide by 2060.

""Carbon neutrality"" means using afforestation, energy conservation and emission reduction to offset greenhouse gas emissions, realizing a relative ""zero emission."""
Dolphins slaughtered near Denmark in annual hunt,"More than 1,400 dolphins were killed on Sunday as whalers from the Faroe Islands in Denmark held the Gridadrap hunt, a century-old tradition of hunting whales and dolphins and killing them for meat and blubber.

The observatory issued a yellow alert for the typhoon, which is the third-most hazardous level.

Chanthu was observed on the sea about 225 kilometers east of Shanghai at around 9 a.m. on Tuesday. It is expected to swirl in the northwestern part of the East China Sea from Tuesday afternoon to Wednesday night, with little change in intensity. Then it is expected to move northeast from Thursday, passing through the Korean Strait and approaching the northern coast of Japan. The intensity will gradually weaken in the process."
Look up! Ozone layer is protecting our planet like an umbrella,"Thursday marks the International Day for the Preservation of the Ozone Layer, a day dedicated to raising awareness about protecting the fragile shield of gas around the Earth.

The Ozone umbrella shields Earth from most of the sun's harmful ultraviolet radiation, making life on the planet possible.

The discovery of Ozone ""holes"" in the 1980s triggered a ban in 1987 on ozone-depleting substances, such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) which were commonly used in refrigerators before the ban.

A new study published in August in the journal Nature shows that the ban has prevented the planet from an additional 0.85 degrees Celsius of warming, highlighting another role of the ozone layer as a terrestrial carbon sink.

Let's take a look at the sky and remind ourselves again how important the ozone layer is."
"Farm subsidies have failed to curb hunger, emissions, says UN","Nearly 90 percent of subsidies provided to the agriculture sector worldwide harm the environment, distort the pricing of produce and fail to curb hunger, a new report revealed on Tuesday.

More than $470 million out of $540 billion subsidies provided to the sector are invested in manufacturing unhealthy products, like sugar and emission-intensive commodities, such as beef, milk and rice, said a report by the United Nations .

While high and middle-income countries consume milk and meat in bulk, leaving behind a significant carbon footprint, farmers in developing countries struggle to get minimal incentives to grow nutritious food.

Without reforms, the report calculated, the subsidies could triple to $1.75 trillion annually by 2030, exacerbating pollution, intensifying food insecurity and widening the gender disparity further.

""Governments have an opportunity now to transform agriculture into a major driver of human well-being, and into a solution for the imminent threats of climate change, nature loss, and pollution,"" said Inger Andersen, executive director of the UN Environment Program.

As agriculture contributes nearly a quarter of the total global greenhouse gas emissions, environmentalists advocate for the effective utilization of the subsidy. They discourage support for the export of produce, which benefits a handful of producers and leads to price disparity in the domestic market.

Despite lucrative subsidies doled out to the sector, countries have failed to supply enough food to eradicate hunger. As a result, more than 800 million people worldwide faced chronic hunger last year, and 2.37 billion people could not get enough food throughout the year.

Reconfiguring agricultural produce support, rather than eliminating it, will help end poverty, eradicate hunger, achieve food security, improve nutrition, promote sustainable agriculture, foster sustainable consumption and production, mitigate the climate crisis, restore nature, limit pollution, and reduce inequalities, the report said.

The report comes as governments prepare for negotiations at the 2021 Food Systems Summit in September, COP15 on biodiversity in October and COP26 on climate change in November.

Qu Dongyu, director-general of the Food and Agriculture Organization, said: ""This report, released on the eve of the UN Food Systems Summit, is a wake-up call for governments around the world to rethink agricultural support schemes to make them fit for purpose to transform our agri-food systems and contribute to the Four Betters: Better nutrition, better production, better environment and a better life.""

But a few countries have already taken action to deal with the issue. For example, the report highlighted China's reform of agricultural policies in 2006 to reduce mineral fertilizers and chemical pesticides. The rampant use of chemicals in farming causes soil pollution, and run-off water pollutes the local water bodies.

Researchers pointed out a ""one-size-fits-all approach"" cannot be applied to farm subsidies. They recommended a six-pronged approach to deal with the issue. They encouraged governments to measure the support provided, understand its positive and negative impacts, and identify repurposing options.

Forecasting the impacts of subsidies, refining the proposed strategy, detailing its implementation plan, and monitoring the implemented strategy have also been strongly encouraged.

East China Sea 101: Precious and rare invertebrate,"A strange species inhabits the East China Sea: ""Wenchang fish,"" which is not really a fish, but a precious and rare marine invertebrate.

The creature is called lancelet, an invertebrate with a notochord instead of a backbone. In China, it could be found in the sea near Hong Kong, Shandong Province and Xiamen City of southeast China's Fujian Province. As it carries the characteristics of both vertebrates and invertebrates, it serves as a model organism for studying evolution.

Lancelet used to be widely distributed in East China Sea. Due to excessive fishing and habitat loss, large amount of lancelets died in the past decades. To protect the species, Xiamen City established ecological reserves to protect the animal. It is also listed as second-class state protected animal in China.

Heartbreaking video: Mother dolphin refuses to let dead calf go,"A grieving mother dolphin just would not let go of its dead baby.

A heartbreaking video taken on September 3 near Zhanjiang City of south China's Guangdong Province shows a Chinese white dolphin using its beak to keep her lifeless calf's body above water while she swims. When the carcass sinks underwater, she dives down to rescue it without hesitation.

Li Min, a dolphin expert with South China Sea Fisheries Research Institute who took the video, said the mourning mother could carry the carcass for days.

Li said the cause of the calf's death remains unknown without an autopsy.

""The cause could be congenital health problems, an inexperienced mother or environment pollution, such as noise or water pollution. It could also be a result of infanticide, which means that it was killed by a male because of intraspecific bullying,"" the dolphin expert said.

Dolphins are highly intelligent mammals that share many emotional similarities with human beings. Mother dolphins and their babies share a strong maternal bond, and the calves usually stay several years close to their mother until going on their own.

Chinese white dolphin, or Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin, is rated as ""vulnerable"" on the list of threatened species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). It's under first-class state protection in China.

"Why do Xinjiang herdsmen transfer 300,000 livestock in autumn?","When the seasons change, herdsmen in Xinjiang's Altay Prefecture start to fulfill their promise to nature, relocating their herds to autumn pastures. The view of more than 300,000 livestock transferring with their keepers is as stunning as Africa's Great Migration.

As most of the nomads live in mountainous areas, their seasonal move is mainly driven by the vertical distribution of climate. They use different routes, ranging from dozens to hundreds of kilometers. During the spring, they stay in the warm dry grasslands where sunlight abounds. When June arrives, they move toward higher altitudes, where the summer pastures have forests and meadows. The temperature here is cooler and food is abundant, providing an ideal environment for the livestock to gain weight.

When autumn arrives, the temperature drops very quickly and even brings snowfall in the high altitude. The herdsmen begin their massive migration from the end of September to the beginning of October to the lower valleys and plains, where they will stay until next spring.

Their transfer of livestock is not only a way to comply with the laws of nature, but also to avoid overgrazing. As every stage of the herd transfer is a ""great migration"" in itself, they must overcome many challenges from nature and diseases. To ensure the safety of both locals and livestock, police are dispatched to help the herdsmen by checking roads and weather, setting up camps and guiding the sheep and cows.

18 of 20 gorillas at Atlanta's zoo have contracted COVID,"At least 18 of the 20 gorillas at Atlanta's zoo have now tested positive for COVID-19, an outbreak that began just days before the zoo had hoped to obtain a veterinary vaccine for the primates, officials said Tuesday.

Zoo Atlanta had announced the first positive tests among the western lowland gorillas on Friday after employees noticed the gorillas had been coughing, had runny noses and showed changes in appetite. A veterinary lab at the University of Georgia returned positive tests for the respiratory illness.

Zoo Atlanta says the National Veterinary Services Laboratories in Ames, Iowa, confirms that at least four of the samples from the gorillas so far have tested positive for the delta variant of the virus.

The zoo says it is using monoclonal antibodies to treat the gorillas at risk of developing complications from the virus.

Officials say there's no evidence that the gorillas can pass the virus back to humans and visitors are too far away to be infected by gorillas.

Because the gorillas live close together in four troops, zoo officials say it's impossible to keep infected animals isolated.

Zoo officials say they believe an asymptomatic employee who cares for the gorillas passed on the virus. The employee had been fully vaccinated and was wearing protective equipment such as a mask and gloves.

""According to our guidelines for animal care staff, if they have the slightest symptoms of a cold they are to stay home,"" said Dr. Sam Rivera, the zoo's senior director of animal health. ""It so happens that the animal care team member, the following day she developed signs that she suspected might be consistent with COVID and was tested and was positive.""

Senior Director of Animal Health at Zoo Atlanta Sam Rivera said the zoo will vaccinate the gorillas with a veterinary vaccine that it had been on the waiting list for prior to the gorillas' positive tests.

Eight gorillas at the San Diego Zoo Safari Park were treated for the virus in January. One San Diego silverback received an experimental antibody regimen, and all recovered.

Researchers toilet train cows to protect the environment,"This Holstein cow is going to the toilet.

As part of a research project, behavioral scientists successfully toilet-trained 11 out of 16 cows.

Even more surprising, the training was easy, according to the study senior author.

""The thing that's really surprising here is how quickly the cows learnt relative to children,"" says Lindsay Matthew, study senior author and animal behavioral scientist at the University of Auckland in New Zealand.

""So with very, very intensive training, some children can learn in a matter of a day or so. But most children, as you'll be aware, take quite some time and some days, weeks or months. And so we only had 15 training sessions with these animals and we had about, on average, 20-25 urinations, and they were fully trained.""

In just 15 days, researchers used the reward and touch of punishment system to get cows to push through a designated gate, go into an astroturf-covered pen nicknamed a ""MooLoo,"" and then urinate, not defecate.

Once their business was done, they were rewarded with a super sweet liquid of mostly molasses.

And if the cow urinated outside the MooLoo, they got a squirt of cold water.

Because of the limited time frame of the experiment, researchers gave diuretics to the cattle to get them to urinate more.

If this experiment originated from a half-joking question on a New Zealand radio talk show, the motive behind the study is very serious.

Massive amounts of urine waste pose an important environmental issue, especially in Europe, according to the researcher.

And cows do pee a lot.

A single cow can produce about eight gallons (30 liters) of urine a day, Matthews says.

When the cattle live indoors, the urine and feces often get mixed together, which produces ammonia, a gas that contributes to acid rain showers.

If the cows live outdoors, it poses another problem.

""When you have animals outdoors, the urea can get converted into nitrates in the soil and then go and pollute the waterways, cause all sorts of problems in the waterways. And also, if the nitrate concentrations are too high, you get blue babies and all that sort of thing. So, that's the direct nitrate problem in the soil. And then the nitrates get converted to nitrous oxide, which is 300 times more potent than carbon dioxide,"" says Matthew.

In 2019, nitrous oxide comprised 7% of all the U.S. greenhouse gases, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.

But the biggest environmental problem for livestock is the methane they emit in belches and flatulence, a significant source of global warming.

The experiment both shows how easy it is to toilet train other animals and how smart cows are, Matthews says.

He thinks the same techniques could be used for sheep, pigs and other livestock.

Although powerful typhoons are nothing new in summer, such a strong one in autumn has caught many by surprise. Meteorological statistics show that in the past 72 years, summer was the most active season for typhoons, with 833 formed during that time, but autumn was a close second with 821 typhoons. And between 1949 and 2020, super typhoons accounted for 27.9 percent of typhoons generated in autumn, compared to 18 percent in summer.

Sea surface temperatures are usually the highest from August to September and this provides good conditions for the generation of typhoons. At the same time, from the end of August to the beginning of September, cold air becomes active, the pressure gradient increases and wind speeds near the center of the typhoon increases, which is also conducive to enhancing a typhoon's intensity. Therefore, in autumn, the probability of a strong typhoon or super typhoon is higher.

Animal-based food generates nearly twice the emissions as plants,"Animal farming accounts for twice as many greenhouse gas emissions as plants grown for consumption, according to a study published Monday that mapped agricultural activities worldwide. From transportation and deforestation to cold storage and the digestive systems of cattle, what humans eat accounts for a major chunk of the emissions behind climate change.

Researchers looked at carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide released by food production and consumption from farming on land. And they found that from 2007 to 2013, the emissions amounted to 35 percent of all human-caused emissions, or 17.318 billion metric tonnes of CO2 equivalent greenhouse gases per year.

The study noted the growing demand for food worldwide and the industry's potential to exacerbate global warming. Plants grown for human consumption generated 29 percent of food emissions, the study published in Nature Food found, and the rest was attributed to other commodities like cotton and rubber. It did not include emissions from fisheries.

Plant-based diets are widely thought to be better for the planet. But lead researcher Atul Jain of the University of Illinois said he wanted to know exactly how much, admitting he had a personal reason for wanting to dig deeper into the issue.

""I've been a vegetarian since my childhood,"" he said. ""I wanted to estimate what my carbon footprint was.""

To come up with a consistent model for so many different products, Jain's team set to work from the ground up, breaking down the globe's farmland into some 60,000 grid squares.""Once we identify the crop area in a grid cell, we determine what percentage of the area is allocated to the crop, to the forest and to the grasses, and so on,"" he said.

Jain said his next research challenge was to include more granular data on consumption trends across the world to build a tool to allow people to calculate their own food-based carbon footprint.

""You can go to your location, identify what you eat, how much you eat and calculate your own carbon footprint,"" he said.

Autumn brings vibrant colors across China,"Leaves in most parts of China have begun to change color from various shades of green to shades of golden yellow, orange, red and brown as autumn unfolds. The grasslands in north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region are embracing peak foliage time, while southern China, such as Hunan Province, is seeing its harvest season as paddy fields are covered with golden yellow."
Climate change could force 216 million people out of their homes,"Reduced agricultural production, water scarcity, rising sea levels and other adverse effects of climate change could cause up to 216 million people to leave their homes and migrate within their own countries by 2050, the World Bank has warned.

The estimate from the Washington-based development lender released Monday updates a 2018 report with new figures from Eastern Europe and Central Asia, North Africa and East Asia and the Pacific to provide a more complete overview of the potential toll from rising global temperatures. And the true toll could be far higher, as the data does not include countries such as those in Europe or North America, nor the Middle East and small island nations.

""Climate change is an increasingly potent driver of migration,"" the report said. Shortages of food and water along with rising seas highlight ""the urgency for action as livelihoods and human well-being are placed under increasing strain."" Juergen Voegele, the World Bank's vice president for sustainable development, said the data give a ""global estimate"" of the scale of potential migration.

Breaking the data down by region, internal migrants due to climate change could hit 86 million in sub-Saharan Africa by 2050, 49 million in East Asia and the Pacific, 40 million in South Asia, 19 million in North Africa, 17 million in Latin America and 5 million in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, according to the bank."

Sustainability offers win-win solution for fishing industry in Fujian,"Fishing farms in a coastal city of east China's Fujian Province have upgraded their facilities to improve the quality of yellow croaker breeding and achieve sustainable development with financial support from the city.

The city of Ningde, located on the northeastern coast of Fujian, is home to one of China's most popular fish species -- the yellow croaker.

Decades of conservation and mariculture farming have helped revive the fish population, which was once nearly extinct due to overfishing. Fish farms in Ningde raise more than 7,000 tons of yellow croaker annually.

About three years ago, the local government began offering subsidies to upgrade the fishing farms, which helps to improve the quality of fish.

The cages can reach deeper, which offers more space for the fish to move; consequently, the overall output and taste of the fish are better.

Yet, the country's largest yellow croaker exporter still faces surging shipping fees and other uncertainties due to the COVID-19 pandemic and economic challenges."
Alien fungi: The medicinal 'swirling clouds',"Have you ever seen ""swirling clouds"" on dead trees? Of course, they are no real clouds, but a kind of mushroom named ""cloud mushroom"" or Yun Zhi (ÔÆÖ¥) in Chinese. Due to their resemblance to the tail of a strutting turkey, they are also known as turkey tail mushrooms.

Turkey tail mushrooms have even more scientific names. If you come across names like Trametes versicolor, Coriolus versicolor and Polyporus versicolor, don't be confused, they all refer to the same mushroom. The Latin word ""versicolor"" means ""of several colors,"" which vividly depicts their wide range of color variations. Although shades of brown are the most commonly seen, you may find them with stunning bands of blue, red, orange or green.

Despite their colorful upper surface, the underside is white and covered in tiny shallow pores. They can be found throughout the year, but they are at their best in autumn and winter when they release spores. The mushrooms usually grow on dead trunks of deciduous trees like oak, beech, maple and birch. They are not only fodder for animals like squirrels, but also colorful shelters for insects.

The Great Herbs: The malaria buster,"A mosquito bites you when you're not paying attention. Over the next 10 to 15 days, you begin to experience fever, headaches and chills. However, you think it's just a common cold, and you don't take it seriously. In the following days, the illness becomes more and more serious, even life-threatening. You have no idea what's going on until the doctor tells you that you have malaria, a disease caused by parasites transmitted to people through the bites of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes. Children with severe malaria frequently develop one or more of the following symptoms: severe anemia, respiratory distress in relation to metabolic acidosis, or cerebral malaria. In adults, multi-organ failure is also frequent. According to the World Health Organization, there were an estimated 229 million malaria cases worldwide, and the estimated number of malaria deaths stood at 409,000 in 2019. The African continent carries a disproportionately high share of the global malaria burden. In that same year, the continent was home to 94 percent of malaria cases and deaths.

The human species has suffered from malaria for thousands of years, but humankind has never surrendered to the disease. In 1820, French chemists Pelletier and Caventou isolated quinine, the active ingredient against malaria, from cinchona bark. However, traditional anti-malarial drugs are not as effective as they used to be because the parasite has developed resistance. In the 1970s, Chinese scientist Tu Youyou's team successfully extracted artemisinin from the Sweet sagebrush (Artemesia annua) plant, which won her the 2015 Nobel Prize in Physiology of Medicine. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends artemisinin-based combination therapy to treat uncomplicated malaria due to Plasmodium falciparum.

Artemisinin is extracted from the Sweet sagebrush plant, which is called ""Huanghuahao"" in Chinese. Because Artemisinin (""Qinghaosu"" in Chinese) and Celery Sagebrush (""Qinghao"" in Chinese) have similar Chinese names, it's often mistakenly believed to be extracted from Celery Sagebrush. At the most critical moment of research and development, Tu Youyou was inspired by ancient Chinese medicine literature. Tu Youyou and other scholars determined that the plant ""Qinghao"" recorded in ancient books refers to Sweet sagebrush rather than Celery Sagebrush through textual research of ancient medical literature, comparison of original plants, chemical composition, pharmacological action and curative effect, etc.

""Qinghao"" mainly treats tuberculosis, malaria, chills and fever, swollen and painful gums, diarrhea and so on, according to ""Compendium of Materia Medica."" According to ""Chinese pharmacopeia,"" ""Qinghao,"" which has a bitter taste and a cool nature, is the dry aboveground part of the Sweet sagebrush plant. It grows in wilderness, hillside, roadside and river banks. It is found in most parts of the country."

The overwhelming majority of fossil-fuel reserves must stay in the ground or the planet's climate crisis will accelerate, according to a new study by researchers at University College London.

Analysis suggests that even to stand a 50-50 chance of keeping global heating below 1.5 degrees Celsius ¨C the growth-figure target enshrined in the Paris Agreement ¨C countries and companies would need to leave 90 percent of coal reserves and 60 percent of oil and gas untouched.

To increase the chances of avoiding climate catastrophe, reductions would need to be even steeper, leaving trillions of dollars of mineral wealth untapped ¨C with inevitable economic effects on companies and countries invested in fossil-fuel extraction.

"Nature congress calls for protecting 30% of Earth, 80% of Amazon","The world's most influential conservation congress passed resolutions Friday calling for 80 percent of the Amazon and 30 percent of Earth's surface, land and sea, to be designated ""protected areas"" to halt and reverse the loss of wildlife. The International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), which is meeting in Marseille, does not set global policy, but its recommendations have in the past served as the backbone for UN treaties and conventions. They will help set the agenda for upcoming UN summits on food systems, biodiversity and climate change.

Saving the Amazon An emergency motion calling for four-fifths of the Amazon basin to be declared a protected area by 2025, submitted by COICA, an umbrella group representing more than two million indigenous peoples across nine South American nations, passed with overwhelming support. ""Indigenous Peoples have come to defend our home and, in doing so, defend the planet. This motion is a first step,"" said Jose Gregorio Diaz Mirabal, general coordinator of COICA and a leader of the Curripaco people in Venezuela. Over the last two decades, the Amazon has lost roughly 10,000 square kilometers every year to deforestation, much of it through fires set deliberately to clear land for commercial agriculture or cattle grazing. This destruction combined with climate change, scientists have warned, could push the world's largest tropical forest irretrievably past a ""tipping point"" into a savannah-like landscape.

'30% by 2030' Another hotly debated measure that was accepted in a vote of IUCN members, government agencies, NGOs and indigenous people's organizations, says that 30 percent of the planet's land and ocean area should have protected status within a decade. The zones selected must include ""biodiversity hotspots"" teaming with animal and plant life, and be backed up by rigorous monitoring and enforcement, the resolution says. Many scientists and conservationists advocated for an even more ambitious ""half-Earth"" target. ""Passage of this motion sends a clear signal to world leaders that the '30 by 30' target, and respect for indigenous and local community rights, must be agreed to at COP15,"" said Campaign for Nature director Brian O'Donnell, referring to a UN biodiversity summit tasked with delivering a treaty next May to protect nature. The pace at which animal and plant species are going extinct is 100 to 1,000 times the normal ""background"" rate, a widely accepted threshold for the kind of mass-extinction event that has only occurred five times in the last half-billion years.

Deep-sea mining The IUCN's 1,400 members overwhelmingly approved a resolution recommending a moratorium on deep sea mining and reform of the International Seabed Authority (ISA), an intergovernmental regulatory body. Industry argued that the unattached rocks on the ocean floor some five kilometers below the waves are a greener source of minerals, manganese, cobalt, nickel, needed to build electric vehicle batteries. But scientists counter that seabed ecosystems at that depth are fragile, and could take decades or longer to heal once disrupted. The measure passed with more than 80 percent of votes from government agencies, and 90 percent support from NGOs and civil society groups. ""The resounding Yes in support for a global freeze on deep seabed mining is a clear signal that there is no social licensee to open the deep seafloor to mining,"" said Jessica Battle, lead of WWF's Deep Sea Mining Initiative.

Climate change commission? The major drivers of species decline and extinction are habitat loss, hunting for food, poaching for animal parts, invasive species and environmental pollution. But climate change is starting to loom large as a threat to wildlife, leading members to vote in a motion for the creation of a climate change commission within the IUCN. The aim is to ""bring together the world's experts on climate change to help shape the agenda around species,"" said Craig Hilton-Taylor, head of the IUCN's Red List Unit. ""The climate and biodiversity emergencies are not distinct, but two aspects of one crisis,"" a draft version of the congress's final manifesto said.

Programmed extinction On Friday, following intense and prolonged debate, the congress endorsed a motion on ""synthetic biology"", an umbrella term for genetic engineering, that tilts towards those in favor of more research and experimentation. One technology in particular that causes local extinction of a species, called gene drive, has divided conservationists. Proponents say it is the best tool available to fight invasive species of rodents, snakes and mosquitos that have already wiped out dozens of species of birds and other vertebrates on island habitats. Opponents fear genetically modified animals could find their way to other continents, or share mutated genes with other species. ""There are obvious ecological risks and concerns regarding genetic modification of wild species"", said Ricarda Steinbrecher, a geneticist working with the NGO Pro Natura. (Cover image via CFP.)

The Great Herbs: From natural dye to herbal medicine,"Written by Li Shizhen (1518-1593), a famous Chinese doctor and pharmacist during the Ming Dynasty, ""Compendium of Materia Medica (Ben Cao Gang Mu)"" records a story about using herbs to treat spider bites. During the Tang Dynasty (618-907), Zhang Jian served as a subordinate to Zhang Yanshang. One day, Zhang Jian was bitten on the neck by a spider. After two nights, his head swelled as big as a bowl, and his stomach was also gradually getting bigger. Zhang Yanshang had always thought highly of Zhang Jian. Zhang Yanshang offered large sums of money to recruit doctors who could treat him. There was a person who claimed that he could cure Jian and he took a bowl of blue juice and sprinkled it on the spider bites. As expected, Jian healed in two days. In the bowl of blue juice was a herb called indigo naturalis.

China rolls out pilot scheme for green power trading,"China rolled out a pilot scheme for green power trading on Tuesday, making strides towards the goals of peaking carbon emissions before 2030 and achieving carbon neutrality by 2060.

Enterprises can trade power with qualified photovoltaic and wind power generation companies. The cost is slightly higher than traditional sources at this stage because the green power also takes into account the environmental cost.



""The high price reflects the rights and interests of renewable energy power generation enterprises, further speeding up the development of renewable energy,"" said Tang Honghai, an employee of Beijing Power Exchange Center.



China General Nuclear Power Corporation (CGN) New Energy Holdings was one of the main green power producers in the Tuesday trading with more than 10 power plants in Jiangsu, Jilin and Anhui provinces participating.



""Over 1 billion kWh of our electricity was traded, generating over 35 million yuan in revenue for our new-energy producing companies,"" said Liu Jiapei, director of marketing center under the electricity marketing department of CGN New Energy Holdings.



Although the price is slightly higher for the electricity-consuming companies, it helps them accelerate green transformation and achieve low-carbon or even zero-emission development.



""The intention of green power trading reached nearly 20 billion kWh, which is about four times the trading scale of this time, indicating that the demand of our power users for green trading is very strong,"" said Tang.



Schneider Electric purchased over 17 million kWh of green power for its five factories in Shanghai, meeting 88 percent of their current round of demand, hoping to realize the relative ""zero emission"" in some factories in advance before 2022.



""We will do a lot of work, for example, the upgrading of green packaging, reducing carbon emission during transportation, photovoltaic power generation and wastewater reclamation. But these measures are not enough. To reach the goal of 100 percent relative zero emission, we must have green power,"" said Zhang Kaipeng, senior vice president of Schneider Electric.



The pilot scheme for green power trading uses blockchain technology. The whole trading process can be traced, tracked and certified, ensuring the traceability from production, trading and consumption, and improving the authority of green power consumption.



""We guide the consumption of green power in a market-oriented way, reflecting the environmental value of green electricity including wind power and photovoltaic power. The successful organization of the green power trading also marks a new step in the establishment of an electricity market system that adapts to the new power system,"" said Zhang Mianrong, chairman of the board of Guangzhou Power Exchange Center.

China adds 268 plants to state protection list,"China announced its amended national list of protected wild plants on Wednesday. There are 455 species of wild plants on the new list, including 54 first-class and 401 second-class protected plants, according to National Forestry and Grassland Administration and Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs.

The new list has three major differences compared with the list published in 1999.

Firstly, the protection level of 18 wild plants has been changed. Vatica guangxiensis and four other plants have been upgraded to first-class protected plants, while 13 first-class protected plants have been downgraded to second-class.

Secondly, 268 wild plants have been added to the new list, such as most types of Venus slippers and some wild plants in genera Tulipa, Cymbidium and Oryza.

Thirdly, 35 wild plants have been removed from the list due to their broad distribution, large population and stable conditions.

China is home to over 36,000 embryophyte, and nearly 50 percent of them are endemic species. The amended list aims to better save endangered wild plants and preserve biodiversity in China.

World in a drop of water: DNA tool transforms nature tracking,"In their search for pink river dolphins, researchers in the Peruvian Amazon scooped up river water containing genetic material they hoped could be useful in tracing the elusive creature. They found what they were looking for, and more.

The environmental DNA collected yielded information on 675 species, including dozens of land-based mammals like deer, jaguar, giant anteaters and monkeys as well as 25 species of bat.

""It's kind of mind blowing,"" said Kat Bruce, founder of the eDNA firm NatureMetrics, which carried out the study for the wildlife charity WWF.

The technology is increasingly used to track rare species.

Bruce hopes eDNA will help revolutionize the way the world measures and monitors nature.

It is at the heart of a $15-million project with the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) that aims to collect and analyze 30,000 freshwater samples over three years from major river systems, including the Amazon, Ganges and Mekong Delta.

With species in precipitous decline and growing calls for international targets on biodiversity protection, organizers say this ""eBioAtlas"" can help inform policy and focus scarce conservation resources.

""What the eBioAtlas will do in the middle of this mass extinction is hopefully start to fill those gaps in in a way that is scalable,"" said Mike Morris, who heads the project for NatureMetrics, at an event showcasing the project at the IUCN conference in Marseille this week.

The IUCN plans to feed the information into conservation tools like its Red List of Threatened Species.

It offers a ""simple and, I would say, precise way to tell us where species are,"" said Paola Geremicca, who leads IUCN's corporate engagement."
Animals 'shape-shifting' as climate warms: study,"Some animals are ""shape-shifting"" and have developed bigger tails, beaks and ears to regulate their body temperatures as the planet warms, according to a new study.

From Australian parrots to European rabbits, researchers found evidence that a host of warm-blooded animals have evolved bigger body parts, which could allow them to lose body heat more effectively.

Climate change is heaping ""a whole lot of pressure"" on animals, said Sara Ryding of Deakin University in Australia, who led the study, in a press release.

""It's high time we recognized that animals also have to adapt to these changes, but this is occurring over a far shorter timescale than would have occurred through most of evolutionary time,"" she said.

The study, published on Tuesday in the journal Trends in Ecology and Evolution, reviewed previous research ""where climatic warming is a potential hidden explanatory variable for the occurrence of shape-shifting"" and found trends particularly noticeable in birds."

Kenya's President Uhuru Kenyatta has on Wednesday, 8th September 2021, declared the drought affecting parts of the country a national disaster.

Consequently, the President has instructed The National Treasury and the Ministry of Interior and Coordination of National Government to spearhead Government efforts to assist affected households including water and relief food distribution as well as livestock uptake.

The decision follows Wednesday's meeting between the Head of State and 85 leaders from Kenya's Arid and Semi Arid Lands (ASAL) led by Treasury Cabinet Secretary Ukur Yatani.

More details of the Government's comprehensive drought mitigation measures will be unveiled in due course.

Last month the report by the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) outlined an emergency action plan to mitigate the situation.

Scanty rainfall during October-December 2020 and March-May 2021 led to prevailing drought conditions, said IFRC.

In June 2021, most arid and semi-arid land (ASAL) areas received less than 50 per cent of the average rainfall, causing a decline in the health of vegetation compared to the preceding month. Those in the northeastern region received less than 25 per cent of average precipitation that month.

The drought situation is expected to last till September in the ASAL counties, according to IFRC. A large share of the population in these areas are pastoralists and agro-pastoralists.

Deteriorating conditions of vegetation, increased distances to water sources, worsening livestock conditions, reduced milk production and increased number of children at risk of malnutrition were observed in an August 2 report by NDMA.

Household food access will remain constrained as staples will be dearer than average, IFRC projected. ""As a result, critical nutrition outcomes will persist in children under five years of age.""

Reduced daily meals, eating food low in nutrition and sale of more livestock than usual will become coping strategies for these families, according to the report.

Rainfall from October to December this year will determine whether the condition in the affected countries will improve, said IFRC. Early projections for the period indicate that the country is likely to experience La Nina conditions, which are associated with low precipitation in East Africa.

First satellite tracking of wild snow leopards in China yields results,"Chinese researchers say they have made ""breakthrough"" findings of the behavior of rare snow leopards after months of tracking them in northwest China using satellite technology.



After gaining prior approval from the National Forestry and Grassland Administration, the Qilian Mountain National Nature Reserve together with the Wildlife Research Institute of Beijing Forestry University launched satellite tracking of snow leopards for the first time, starting from early this year.



The researchers were allowed to catch the animals and attach positioning collars in a bid to strengthen the monitoring of their behaviors and habitats to better protect the endangered species.



""We actually wanted to do satellite tracking of snow leopards for years, but we were under quite a lot of restrictions. Because the snow leopard is under first-class state protection in China, we might incur some risks from capturing it. After we got the administrative approval, we made full preparations and caught three snow leopards for research,"" said Shi Kun, head of the Wildlife Research Institute under Beijing Forestry University.



""The satellite collars fixed on the snow leopard can help us better understand its behavior, and its activity patterns mainly.""



The first batch of data collected by the satellite tracking system is considered by experts to be breakthrough findings compared with previous scientific records.



""In the past, we had a limited understanding of the snow leopard's range of home activity, which was normally considered to be around 100 square kilometers. But now, through the satellite tracking, we've found out that their range of home activity is very extensive, with that of some reaching up to about 1,700 square kilometers, far beyond our expectations,"" Shi said.



The first three snow leopards captured for satellite tracking were distributed in the Qilian Mountain National Nature Reserve, which straddles the border of Qinghai and Gansu provinces in northwest China, and are different in age and sex.



The first captured snow leopard, a female about to come of age, was named Suye by the researchers.



The second was a male leopard later named Lingzhe. The new adult had been found straying into a farmer's house in Qinghai's Menyuan Hui Autonomous County in March and was captured and treated by the Qinghai wildlife rescue center before being released back into the wild with a satellite collar.



The capture of the third leopard ""Nayin"" was relatively easy as it was old. Even after it was released, the male leopard maintained its regular activities.



The three snow leopards with satellite collars have all been released back to the wild. The researchers have been tracking satellite signals and conducting on-the-spot investigations as the collars continue to send back data.

Q: What needs to happen to lessen the impact of climate change and biodiversity loss? A: We can hope to bend the curve of biodiversity loss by enhancing protection efforts, by the restoration of ecosystems and also by translational change referring to sustainable production and sustainable consumption. Also by trying to fight against the impacts of climate change. And when we do all of this, it is hopeful that we can mitigate climate change and at the same time bend the curve of biodiversity loss. Q: What are the main problems that China faces in terms of biodiversity challenges? A: In China, it is the case like it is in the whole world. It is that challenge of development, I'm referring to economic and social development, with responsibilities and how to deal with the conflicts between development and conservation. It is really a challenging topic and the Chinese government really realizes the problems and also the social challenges, so they took a number of actions to fight against biodiversity loss while carrying out sustainable development actions. Q: China has had some success in species conservation such as setting up tiger reserves and monitoring the critically endangered Hainan black-crested gibbon. But why are Chinese animals also being lost, like the giant paddlefish and the Baiji river dolphin, which have gone extinct in recent years?

Extinction of climate resilient wild crops may intensify food crisis,"Many crucial crops resilient to climate change, pests and diseases might become extinct, leading to food shortages and loss of livelihood globally, warned a study on Tuesday.

More than 70 wild varieties of plants closely related to maize, potato, bean, squash, chilli pepper, vanilla, avocado, husk tomato and cotton crops are on the verge of extinction, said the study published in the journal Plants, People, Planet.

The wild species of these crops native to Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras are known for providing genetic diversity, which is facing unprecedented crises, mostly due to human activities. The loss of these crops, according to the study, could lead to loss of livelihoods in rural areas and intensify global food availability.

The findings were released during the ongoing International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) quadrennial World Conservation Congress in France. The meeting seeks to formulate conservation plans to prevent global biodiversity loss.

""In today's fast-changing world, genetic diversity is crucial to making our crops resilient to climate change. We need biodiversity to ensure sustainable livelihoods and food security for the world's growing population, as this study shows,"" said IUCN Director General Dr. Bruno Oberle.

""These results also highlight the urgent need for a strong global biodiversity conservation framework that sets measurable, science-based goals to ensure a resilient future,"" Oberle added.

Habitat loss, pesticide and invasive species wreaking havoc

Researchers have placed all eight species of vanilla in the region under the ""endangered"" or ""critically endangered"" category, one of the highest risk categories on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Cotton also faces a similar risk, with 92 percent of the crop's variety facing extinction threat.

The study also listed around 60 percent of avocado, 23 percent of potato, 12 percent of husk tomato and 9 percent of squash species as threatened with extinction.

Shockingly, nearly 35 percent of 224 plants analyzed in the study were threatened with extinction because their wild habitats have been converted for human use. In addition, the shift from traditional agricultural systems to mechanization and rampant use of herbicides and pesticides have further pushed these crops towards extinction.

Prevalence of invasive species and pests, contamination from genetically modified crops, over-collection and logging also contribute to the threats faced by these plants.

""It is imperative that conservation and agricultural sectors work together to safeguard Mesoamerica's crop wild relatives while supporting rural economies and livelihoods,"" said Dr. Barbara Goettsch, chair of the IUCN SSC Cactus and Succulent Plant Specialist Group.

""These species must be protected on the ground through sustainable and diverse agricultural production. At the same time, the genetic diversity of crop wild relatives must be better represented in gene banks."""
Watch two new members of the world's rarest primate,"Here is a glimpse of the two babies:

But in March, a monitoring team found that two of the Hainan gibbon groups each had a new baby, aged 1 and 2 months old respectively.

Prior to the discovery, there were only 33 Hainan gibbons left in the world, concentrated in a small patch of rainforest in the reserve, making them the most endangered of all gibbons.

A family of Hainan black crested gibbon, the world's rarest primate, has welcomed two newborns in Bawangling National Nature Reserve in southern China's island province of Hainan, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) announced on Sunday during the 7th World Conservation Congress (WCC).

The slender Hainan black crested gibbon, which has long arms and legs, is a tree-dwelling ape that feeds on ripe, sugar-rich fruit, such as figs. Males are mostly black and females golden with a black patch on the crown of their head.

Babies are born golden and turn black at about 6 months of age. Males stay that color but females start to shift back to golden at about 7 or 8 years of age when they become sexually mature.

Fan Pengfei, a biologist from Sun Yat-sen University in southern China's Guangzhou City who has been studying gibbons for nine years, said that the discovery made him very happy.

""The population of Hainan black crested gibbons once dropped to less than 10, so every newborn baby is very important for the species' conservation,"" Fan said.

The gibbon, which breeds every two years, has seen a steady rise in its population in recent years. But Fan remains concerned that conservation efforts still have a long way to go before the tag ""critically endangered"" can be dropped.

""The population of 35 means that it remains the world's most endangered primate,"" he said. ""The main obstacle at the current stage is the limited area of habitats that are suitable to the species.""

She drank a potion made from the plant for 10 days and recovered.

Later on, a county official's mother suffered from the same disease. The scholar offered his services to the official, hoping that he could cure her with the same medical recipe that the doctor had used. The scholar then went up the mountains to look for the plant but couldn't find it. The official thought he was a swindler.

It was not until late spring and early summer the following year that the doctor came back to the village. The scholar complained to him that he couldn't find the plant. After hearing the whole story, the doctor said with a sigh: ""When I left the county last year, I asked you to remember to pick those weeds before the summer ends because they wither right after summer."" The doctor then led the scholar up the mountains where they found the purple plant blooming all around.

China's Hainan gibbon protection success for biodiversity conservation,"The conservation of Hainan gibbons in China is a success for biodiversity preservation worldwide, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) announced on Sunday during the ongoing 7th World Conservation Congress (WCC). Hainan gibbon, the most endangered of all gibbons and the world's rarest primate, is endemic to the southern Chinese island of Hainan. Its population has increased from as few as seven to nine in the 1980s to 35 today, according to a report released at the WCC held both online and in-person in Marseille, France. The report, titled ""The Hainan Gibbon Case Study: Effectively Saving a Critically Endangered Species"" and written by 15 experts from 11 organizations worldwide, was released at a press conference simultaneously held in Marseille and Haikou, capital of Hainan. The success of this case was achieved ""thanks to efficient protection by the Chinese central to local governments and a combined effort by Chinese and international scientists and conservation communities to understand the behavioral ecology of these gibbons,"" Susan Cheyne, a specialist on small apes with the IUCN Species Survival Commission (SSC), told the press via video link.

Dubbed as ""Giant Pandas of Hainan,"" Hainan gibbons are currently found only in a single reserve, Bawangling Nature Reserve, which is part of the Hainan Tropical Rainforest National Park. In March, the monitoring team found that two of the Hainan Gibbon groups each added a baby ape, 7 months old and 6 months old, respectively, said Huang Jincheng, director of the Forestry Department of Hainan Province, at the press conference. ""Continuous monitoring shows that the two baby apes are in good health and growing well,"" said Huang.

Vance Martin, president of the U.S.-based WILD Foundation, told Xinhua after the conference that the case of the Hainan Gibbon is very special because of its extremely low number. The reason behind this successful conservation is ""brilliant and enlightened leadership, international cooperation and experts who really care, and then it is the unique way that the leadership enlisted the local community and the local community who wanted to do it,"" he said. Martin, also an expert in international nature conservation and wilderness protection, said there is a big picture story going on in China with nature conservation, ""which is a modern-day global example of how you have to go about conservation."" ""China's example with eco-civilization, and looking at big picture and putting the big picture to work locally in particular areas with community involvement, is exactly what the world needs to do,"" he concluded.

Wildlife on a glidepath to 'mass extinction': Red List chief,"Nearly 30 percent of the 138,374 species assessed by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List are at risk of extinction, the global conservation body reported last Saturday. Habitat loss, overexploitation and illegal trade have hammered global wildlife populations for decades, and climate change is now kicking in as a direct threat, the head of the IUCN's Red List Unit told AFP in an interview. Q. Are we in or on the cusp of the sixth mass extinction? A: If we look at extinctions every 100 years since 1500, there is a marked inflection starting in the 1900s. The trend is showing that we are 100 to 1,000 times higher than the ""background"", or normal, extinction rates. I would certainly say that the red list status shows that we're on the cusp of the sixth extinction event. If the trends carry on going upward at that rate, we'll be facing a major crisis soon.

Q: The Red List began in 1964. Has it changed much? A: The initial list wasn't really based on scientific criteria. It was more of a gut feel: ""We think the species is under some degree of threat."" But as the list started to grow, we realized that we needed to make the list scientifically defensible. So, we took a big step back and asked: ""What is it we are trying to measure?"" The answer was quite simple: risk of extinction.

Arabian Oryx in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. /CFP Arabian Oryx in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. /CFP

Q: Are there species that would have gone extinct without the Red List? A: There are lots of species around the world that we would almost certainly have lost. The Red List process drew attention, for example, to the plight of the Arabian oryx and led to conservation efforts, taking the animals out of the wild, captive breeding, reintroductions. We've seen species very nearly extinct that are thriving now. Q: Does the Red List make recommendations? A: The Red List is not policy prescriptive. It's really just a statement of fact; this is what the status of the species is. Then it's up to the decision-makers to interpret that and decide what policies should be enacted. Q: Do you ever come under pressure over the listings? A: There is lots of lobbying. Surprisingly, it's not so much about the up-listing to a higher threat level. For some high-profile charismatic species, if you want to down-list them because there have been successful conservation actions, we often get lobbied very, very hard not to do that. There's real concern that if a species goes down a category, that conservation investment will stop. This is where the 'green status' will really help. Q. What is the green status? A: After you've done the Red List assessment, what are you going to do about it? This is where we started talking about the green status. How do you measure whether your conservation actions are being successful? If we hadn't done anything, where would it be now? If we stopped all conservation efforts now, what will happen to that species going forward? Those are the metrics in the green status process.

Polar bear. /CFP Polar bear. /CFP

Q: Couldn't that lead to species conservation triage? A: There's a limited amount of funding available and a vast number of species. It does come down to some really harsh realities. You're obligated to just let some species go extinct because we really can't save them. But it's not something we tackle head-on in the Red List process. We effectively pass the buck on to others to make those very hard decisions. Q: Climate change is rarely cited as a driver of extinction. Why is that? A: It is obvious for the polar bears because of the direct link between sea ice cover and global warming. But with other megafauna, it's a lot harder to detect the impacts of climate change. There is evidence pointing to climate change for the increasing frequency and intensity of wildfires. But when experts record threats to a species, they may put 'increased fire frequency,' not climate change. The chytrid fungus is wiping out amphibians all around the world, and we are pretty sure that its emergence is very much linked to climate change. But with the evidence we have now, the category of threat is invasive species, not climate change.

The fact sheet was jointly developed by Baltic Earth and the Baltic Marine Environment Protection Commission ¨C also known as the Helsinki Commission or HELCOM ¨C in order to provide a better understanding of the impact of climate change in the area.

""The Baltic Sea Climate Change Fact Sheet provides a summary for policymakers of the latest scientific knowledge on how climate change is currently affecting the Baltic Sea and what we can expect to happen in the future,"" said Professor Markus Meier from the Leibniz Institute for Baltic Sea Research, who coordinated the publication as a leading authority on this subject.

According to the document, sea ice has been monitored in the Baltic since 1750. Between 1985 and 2015, a 10-percent decrease per decade has been observed in many parts of the sea.

""Water temperatures of the Baltic Sea have been increasing during the past 100 years, and are projected to continue to rise during the 21st century,"" said Meier.

The fact sheet describes the impact of rising water temperatures and sea levels, and diminishing ice cover, both on ecosystems and marine species. These factors also affect maritime activities such as shipping, fisheries, and aquaculture."

Their unique food preferences often make people misunderstand them and neglect their contribution to the environment. By eating carcasses and other organic waste, vultures help to clean up our environment and prevent disease from spreading.

International Vulture Awareness Day is celebrated on the first Saturday in September each year to raise public awareness of these birds and the important role they play in the ecosystem.

The world's 23 different vulture species are categorized based on where they live. New World vultures consist of seven species native to North and South America, while Old World vultures include 16 species found in Africa, Asia, and Europe.

Over half of the species are listed by IUCN Red List as endangered. They face a range of threats, including poisoning, electrocution, food shortage and habitat loss. Poisoning is a major threat to vultures, primarily from toxins or lead in the carcasses they eat."

Asian elephant herd 'the short nose family' about to return home,"An Asian elephant herd is now only a little over 100 km away from their home after a long and unusual journey that has caught the attention of people in China and overseas.

Infrared camera footage shows that 14 elephant members of the ""short nose family"" marched across the Guozhe Bridge in Pu'er City of southwest China's Yunnan Province at about 1:40 a.m., one step closer to their safe return.

The herd started to walk north in March last year and had traveled over 1,300 km, prompting a provincial emergency response mission. Over 300 evacuation operations were conducted to avoid conflicts between local residents and the giants from the jungle.

What brought these elephants away from their original habitat in the nature reserve of Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture remains a mystery. During a press conference in August, China's National Forestry and Grassland Administration listed three possible causes: an increase in the Asian elephant population, habitat deterioration due to farming or other activities and habitat fragmentation due to infrastructure construction.

East China Sea 101: A beautiful leopard with cloud-like fur,"Named for the spotted fur that has a cloud-liked pattern, the clouded leopard, a beautiful Asian big cat, is known for its beauty all over the world, though only little information has been discovered by scientists about the species.

The clouded leopard inhabits dense forests of southeast Asia and the eastern Himalayas, in the countries and areas including China, Thailand, Laos and Bangladesh. As its tail helps it balance when it moves and climbs up and down vertical tree trunks, the clouded leopard is a talented climber as well as a hunter. It rests in trees during daytime and climbs off to the ground for hunting during night.

Unfortunately, the beautiful creature has been poached for its fur for years. Except for illegal hunting, habitat loss is also one of the reasons that has caused the population to decrease.

In Fujian Province, southeast China, the creature lives like a hermit in the nature reserve areas including Guilong Mountain and Daiyun Mountain. As it sometimes hunts chickens and ducks as food, so residents in the areas have been informed to not harm them.

Unlike previous Fengyun satellites that only observed the Earth, FY-3E is equipped with advanced instruments that can observe the sun.

The Solar X-ray and EXTREME Ultraviolet Imager is China's first space solar telescope and the world's first solar imager covering both X-ray and extreme ultraviolet wave ranges. Images it collected can be used to warn of the impact of solar activities on aerospace, telecommunications, navigation, power grids, oil pipelines and other infrastructure.

Equipped with 11 remote sensing payloads, the FY-3E is part of the Fengyun-3 series of meteorological satellites and is the first in the world to be sent into early morning orbit for civil service.

It is mainly tasked with obtaining atmospheric temperature, humidity and other meteorological parameters for numerical prediction applications, to improve China's weather forecast capacity. But it also monitors global snow and ice coverage, sea surface temperatures, natural disasters and ecology to better respond to climate change and prevent and mitigate meteorological disasters. To meet the needs for space weather forecasts and supporting services, the satellite is monitoring solar and space environments and their effects, as well as ionospheric data.

"Weather, climate disasters surge fivefold in 50 years: UN","Weather-related disasters have skyrocketed over the past half-century, causing far more damage even as better warning systems have meant fewer deaths, the UN said Wednesday.

A report from the UN's World Meteorological Organization (WMO) examined mortality and economic losses from weather, climate and water extremes between 1970 and 2019.

It found that such disasters have increased fivefold during that period, driven largely by a warming planet, and warned the upward trend would continue.

""The number of weather, climate and water extremes are increasing and will become more frequent and severe in many parts of the world as a result of climate change,"" said WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas.

In total, there were more than 11,000 disasters attributed to these hazards globally since 1970, causing more than two million deaths and some $3.64 trillion in losses.

Hurricane Ida, which slammed into the US Gulf Coast at the weekend and killed at least four people, could become the costliest weather disaster on record, Taalas told reporters.

""There is a chance that the economic cost will be higher than Katrina,"" he said, adding that improved prevention and protection measures had ensured that Ida caused only a fraction of the casualties of the giant storm that devastated the same area exactly 16 years earlier.

Until now, Katrina, which killed more than 1,800 people and destroyed large parts of New Orleans, had been considered by far the costliest weather-related disaster, racking up nearly $164 billion in economic losses."

Bengal tigers are listed on the International Union for the Conservation of Nature's Red List of Threatened Species as endangered. ""We're taking care of her so that she survives,"" said the zoo's director Eduardo Sacasa. ""This is a difficult period for her because she did not get any colostrum for her natural defenses.""

Cub's mother Dalila had given birth to a female white tiger cub called Nieve, or snow, in December, but that baby died of respiratory problems only two weeks later despite the special care given by the zoo.

Nicaragua's National Zoo has two other female tigers that have also given births. Sacasa said the births give him hope the zoo can be a kind of ""genetic center"" in protecting the species.

Plastic threatens migratory species in Asia-Pacific: UN,"From endangered freshwater dolphins drowned by discarded fishing nets to elephants scavenging through rubbish, migratory species are among the most vulnerable to plastic pollution, a UN report on the Asia-Pacific region said Tuesday, calling for greater action to cut waste.

Plastic particles have infiltrated even the most remote and seemingly-pristine regions of the planet, with tiny fragments discovered inside fish in the deepest recesses of the ocean and peppering Arctic sea ice.

The paper by the UN's Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS) focused on the impacts of plastic on freshwater species in rivers and on land animals and birds, which researchers said were often overlooked victims of humanity's expanding trash crisis.

It said that because these creatures encounter different environments, including industrialized and polluted areas, they are likely at risk of higher exposure to plastics and associated contaminants.

Researchers cited estimates that 80 percent of the plastic that ends up in the oceans originates on land, with rivers thought to play a key role in carrying debris out to sea."

It was also a long-time coming for the 32-year-old Su, who has missed out on a top podium place at National Games in the three past editions, finishing 6th in 2009, and then second in 2013 and 2017.

Xie Zhenye, who holds the men's 200m record in Asia, clinched the silver medal behind Su with 10.10 seconds.

The next edition of the National Games, co-hosted by Guangdong Province, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, and the Macao Special Administrative Region, will be held in 2025 by which time Su will be 36.

""The chance for me to particiapte will be minimal then,"" said the Guangdong native in a post-game interview. ""This might be my last appearace on this stage, but definitely not my last match,"" he added.

The Women's Tennis Association (WTA) announced on Monday the first three players to qualify for the season-ending WTA Finals, starting on November 8: world number one and number two, Australian Ashleigh Barty and Belarusian Aryna Sablenka, as well as French Open champion Barbora Krejcikova.

The event, due to be held in Guadalajara, Mexico after it was relocated from Shenzhen, China earlier this month, is typically contested by the top eight singles and doubles players of the year. The 2021 edition will also mark the 50th year anniversary of the singles event, and the 45th for the doubles.

""Lifting the Billie Jean King Trophy in Shenzhen in 2019 is one of the best moments of my career,"" Barty said after qualifying.

""It's a great honor to be among the top eight players in the world and be the first to qualify for the 2021 WTA Finals,"" she added.

Whether the world number one can participate however is still in doubt as she is ""physically and mentally exhausted,"" her coach Craig Tyzzer said in an interview with the Australian Associated Press.

Barty suffered an early exit from the U.S. Open this month, and both the high altitude and the timing of the Finals will be challenging, as she needs time to prepare for the Grand Slam she is aiming for: the 2022 Australian Open in January.

For Sabalenka and Krejcikova, this will be their first time taking part in the WTA Finals' singles event, although both have played before in the doubles.

So far two doubles pairs have qualified for this year's event: Krejcikova and Katerina Siniakova, as well as Japan's Shuko Aoyama and Ena Shibahara.

Roger Federer: Worst is behind me,"Roger Federer said his injury comeback was not yet in sight but insisted he was over the worst as the 40-year-old tennis great targets a return to the courts.



Federer had been out for more than a year with two surgeries on his right knee before getting back onto the tour this year. But he played only 13 matches, and underwent a third operation following his quarter-final defeat at Wimbledon in July.



""I'm doing very well; the rehab is progressing step by step,"" the Swiss star said at an event in Zurich.

""The worst is behind me. I'm looking forward to everything that happens to me to come.""



""When you come back from an injury, every day is a better day. So it's an exciting time."" He said that given everything he had been through with his troublesome knee, dealing with the situation was ""not a mental problem at all.""



The 20-time Grand Slam champion, now ranked ninth in the world, said he sees returning to the professional tour as a ""challenge.""



Federer added he hoped to get back to fitness training and hitting balls on the tennis court as soon as possible, but accepted that ""that still takes a little patience.""



He withdrew from this year's French Open after reaching the fourth round and bowed out at Wimbledon with a tame 6-3, 7-6 (7/4), 6-0 loss to Poland's Hubert Hurkacz.

$75-billion TV deal would bring another Black Friday in NBA,"Logo of the NBA. /CFP Logo of the NBA. /CFP

The NBA is trying to negotiate a new broadcasting contract that could be worth as much as $75 billion, according to Jabari Young of CNBC. The current TV deal which began in 2016 and is due for renewal in 2025 is worth about $24 billion. That was a huge number when it was signed, and one of the consequences it led to was a dramatic rise in the salary cap from $70 million in the 2015-16 season to $84.1 million in the 2016-17 season. If the league can settle a new broadcasting contract worth $75 billion this time, teams may be looking at a $171-million salary cap for the 2025-26 season.

Does anyone still remember what happened when the teams found they had so much money to spend in the summer of 2016? Allen Crabbe signed a four-year, $75-million contract with the Portland Trail Blazers; Nicolas Batum signed a five-year, $120-contract with the Charlotte Hornets; Ian Mahinmi signed a four-year, $64-million contract with the Washington Wizards; Kent Bazemore signed a four-year, $70-million contract with the Atlanta Hawks; Evan Turner signed a four-year, $75-million contract with the Trail Blazers; Luo Deng signed a four-year, $72-million contract with the Los Angeles Lakers; Timofey Mozgov signed a four-year, $64-million contract with the Lakers; Chandler Parsons singed a four-year, $95-million contract with the Dallas Mavericks. If you don't remember who these guys above are, don¡¯t worry, the teams that inked the deals back then want to forget they ever did so. Of course, it's not all bad news in that crazy summer in 2016 because at least one team had quite sweet memories: The Golden State Warriors signed free agent Kevin Durant and did not have to pay luxury tax after adding KD to their roster of Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green and Andre Iguodala.

Wall and the Houston Rockets agreed with each other that it's time to move on. By contract, Simmons made himself look like an ungrateful, spoiled kid while the Philadelphia 76ers seemed like a greedy organization that wanted to squeeze every last drop of value trading their franchise player.

It's hardly news in today's NBA that star players want to leave the teams that brought them to the league. The question is why and how."

Veteran table tennis player Hou Yingchao surprised players and audiences during the 14th National Games, as he defeated several top-ranked players, including world number nine Liang Jingkun in the men's team event for bronze on Tuesday.

The 41-year-old's performance eventually helped his Team Shaanxi to 4th place.

Players and fans jokingly gave Hou the title of ""quality inspector"" for the national team after he defeated Xu Xin, Wang Chuqin, Zhao Zihao, and Liang Jingkun, all franchise players.

A member of the squad from 1998 to 2013, Hou was already national champion twice, in 2000 and again in 2019 when the Shaanxi Province team asked him to join. That year, Hou became the oldest men's singles player in Chinese table tennis history to win at national championships.

While he did not bag a medal in Xi'an, Hou won praise from many, including two-time Olympic gold medalist Ma Long who expressed his admiration after the men's team semi-final, where he sealed the deal for Team Beijing against Hou's Team Shaanxi.

""I have much respect for him, as he is able to perform on such high level at this age,"" Ma said.

Team Shaanxi fell short on their pursuit for the bronze medal, but Hou did his best not just to compete, but also to enjoy the competition.

""I have deep feelings for table tennis. It has always been a part of my life, like something that lives in me,"" said Hou.

""Nearly flawless. Couldn't ask for more."" That's Hu Dewen's verdict on China's performance at the just-concluded Tokyo Paralympics and the earlier Olympics. The octogenarian's view counts: he has tracked the engrossing ebb and flow of every Games since 1984, when the live broadcast of the global spectacle was beamed into homes across China for the very first time. Hale and hearty, he is also the rarest kind of sports junkie who tirelessly buries himself in full replays from the past Olympics. ""I just can't get enough of this sort of stuff,"" the soft-spoken old bloke mused before retreating to his self-proclaimed ""Game Room"". Hu will have a lot to chew on this time around. Coming close on the heels of the Olympics in which China equaled its best achievement in an overseas Games by winning 38 gold medals, just one behind the top-ranked U.S., Team Dragon again reigned supreme in the Paralympics. True to form, they displayed unmatched dominance to seal 96 golds and extended their breathtaking string of success at the showpiece event, having topped the medals table at every Paralympics since 2004. While the flame that lit up Tokyo for the best part of six eventful weeks was elaborately doused on Sunday night in a closing ceremony that echoed the unrelenting COVID-19 crisis and brought an end to Japan's Olympic summer, avid watchers like Hu won't have to wait long for the next sporting extravaganza. The 2022 Winter Olympics are less than five months away, as all eyes now turn to the host city Beijing, whose successful staging of the Games in 2008 is still fresh in the memory.

In a scheduling quirk, the 180-day gap between Tokyo 2020 and Beijing 2022 marks the shortest turnaround between editions of the Olympics since 1992 - the last time the Winter and Summer Games were held in the same year. While uncertainty remains the new normal during the coronavirus era, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) President Thomas Bach was oozing confidence that China could pull off a brilliant feast for sports fans around the world. ""All the elements are now in place for China to host the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics, which will change the landscape of winter sports forever. The whole Olympic family is looking forward to this global festival,"" declared Bach in a congratulatory letter sent to the 2021 World Winter Sports Expo (WWSE), which went live at Beijing's stylish Shougang Park on Friday. As a central platform for the international winter sports industry, this year's WWSE devotes multiple exhibition booths, professional presentations and panel discussions to detail the final preparations for the Beijing Winter Games. Key milestones were underlined by various interactive platforms. All competition venues have been completed and passed on-site pre-homologation tests, while the Olympic Village and International Broadcast Center have also been primed to welcome guests.

The WWSE, a key part of the 2021 China International Fair for Trade in Services (CIFTIS), also spotlighted China's deepening cooperative ties with winter sports powerhouses. Finland, Norway, Austria and Switzerland have all hosted and trained Chinese elite coaches and athletes in their world-class sports facilities over the past few years. Meanwhile, more than 300 campaigns to raise awareness on winter sports was held in China in recent months, engaging nearly 100 million people, according to Zhang Qian, head of the international relations department of the Beijing 2022 Olympic Games Organizing Committee (BOCOG). Over 1.1 million people have signed up as volunteers, he added. As a testament to China's pledge to stage a Green Olympics, all venues will be powered 100 percent by renewable energy with the electricity being generated by means of wind power and solar photovoltaic (PV) systems. The Beijing Games are only the second Winter Olympics to achieve ISO 20121 certification, an international standard governing sustainable event management created by the International Organization for Standardization.

And more to the point, with Tokyo 2020 now in the rear-view mirror, Beijing 2022 will ramp up for the final stretch. ""Ten international test events, two domestic test events and three international training weeks will be held in Beijing from October to December,"" said Liu Yumin, head of the planning and construction department of the BOCOG. As Beijing organizers have not revealed the full extent of the COVID-19 countermeasures yet, those test events could offer a sneak peek at the meticulous precautions they are expected to take against COVID-19. China has repeatedly asserted that its top priority in holding the Olympics is the health and safety of all those involved in the event. The country has backed up its words with the setting up of a coronavirus prevention and control task force, which is jointly headed by the BOCOG, the IOC and the World Health Organization, and dedicated to meet the exacting standards required of the Winter Games. ""We will learn from Tokyo's experience and take into account Beijing's current anti-virus policies,"" observed Liu. ""Preventive measures will be implemented specific to each venue's needs. Some temporary facilities, such as separate walkways, wall claddings, makeshift restrooms and isolation centers, are being added to all venues to minimize exposure and cross-infection.""

Jordan Larson on USA winning women's volleyball gold in Tokyo,"The USA women's volleyball captain Jordan Larson spoke to CGTN's Wang Dong after leading her team to win gold in the 2020 Tokyo Summer Olympics. The Americans described victory in Tokyo as a dream come true.

USA had won three silver medals and two bronze medals since first getting on the medal stand in 1984. After decades-long quest for the first Olympic gold, they finally got to the top step by beating Brazil, the team that kept the USA from the throne twice in Beijing in 2008 and London in 2012.

Larson thought unity is one of the team's keys to success and she felt surprised by the straight-set win against China when they beat the defending champions 3-0 in the group stage. However, the outside hitter understood the dismay of Lang Ping's squad over the group stage exit.

The Tokyo Olympic women's volleyball MVP also announced in the interview that she will continue her club career by returning to China to play for Shanghai again this season. But the 34-year-old has not decided on her plans for the 2024 Paris Summer Olympics. However, she is confident that USA will be among contenders in Paris."
Diving gold medalist Xie Siyi: I have gone through too much in 9 years,"Twenty-five-year-old Xie Siyi won the gold medals of both men's 3m springboard and synchronized 3m springboard in the Tokyo Olympics.

Xie's performance was dominant in the two events, but it may surprise you that he joined the Chinese national diving team in 2012 and made his Olympic debut nine years later.

In 2014, Xie broke his leg twice and one of the doctors told him he could not dive anymore. However, Xie made it back to the springboard half a year later and won the title in men's 1m springboard event in the World Aquatics Championships in Kazan in 2015.

Nonetheless, Xie's bad luck did not stop. He had to undergo surgery again right before the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro in 2016. He could barely walk during that time, not to mention attend the Olympics.

But Xie came back in the end. When he was standing on the podium wearing the gold medal, only he knew how much he has gone through in all these years."
China's Chen Meng lives up to the status as world's top paddler,"Chinese table tennis star Chen Meng lived up to her status as world number one by winning the women's singles gold medal at the Tokyo Olympics, winning an all-China final over teammate Sun Yingsha 4-2 last week.

It was Chen's first Olympic gold medal, but the 27-year-old said she had already turned the page and shifted her focus from her crowning moment to women's team final between China and Japan due to happen on Thursday.

""In fact, I think the mood at this moment has actually calmed down a lot,"" said Chen in an interview with CGTN.

""Because it has been a few days since the end of the women's singles final, now we've turned our focus to the team event. I also hope that in this relatively good state, I will be able to win another gold medal, together with others of the team.""

After winning the top honor, Chen hugged her coach Ma Lin for the first time, expressing her respect and gratitude.

""Over the past two years, I've been working with my coach Ma Lin, and getting to know each other better. And our communication, coupled with victories, has taught us to trust each other more and more. So our cooperation continues to get stronger, and the progress that has been made in the last two years is there for all to see.""

The 27-year-old believes she and teammate Sun are sharing this era as top paddlers in the world.



""Actually this is our era. I think Sun Yingsha is also very good because she's much younger than I and she can sweep past opponents like Mima Ito in an event like the Olympics. Those wins give us a lot of excitement and confidence. And I really want to thank all of my opponents because it is their progress that pushes me to constantly improve and get stronger.""

Chen also said she looks forward to defending her title at Paris Olympics three years later.



""For me, I absolutely hope to participate in the Paris Olympics, and I want to have that opportunity to represent China once again. In fact, there isn't much time before the Paris Olympics, so I want to keep working hard over the next three years to maintain my best form."""

Chen Yufei: Win over nemesis Tai signifies recognition for my efforts,"Chen Yufei won the gold medal in women's singles badminton by edging Tai Tzu-ying of Chinese Taipei 2-1 in the final on Sunday. Chen's victory brought the title back to China after a streak of four straight Olympic golds was broken five years ago in Rio de Janeiro.

Chen and the national team are optimistic that her victory on Sunday will ring in a new era for the country in this event.



Chen needed three sets to outclass Tai at the Musashino Forest Sport Plaza and claimed just her fourth win in 19 matches against the current world number one. The 23-year-old picked up the highly sought-after gold medal for China, as the national squad have been eager to regain their dominance on the women's side of the net.



""I really felt a huge sense of relief since that was a grueling match, so I just naturally collapsed to the court immediately, and the gold medal, to me, signifies recognition for my efforts,"" Chen told CGTN Sports Scene.



After Spain's defending champion Carolina Marin withdrew from the Olympics due to injury, the women's singles bracket was thrown wide open. Tai and India's P.V. Sindhu were among the biggest favorites to claim the title. Chen did not necessarily expect to end up on top of the podium.



Chen said she didn't think much about the outcome before the Games because she just plays her own style and focuses on the process. According to her, competing at the next Olympics will be her primary goal alongside other goals, like taking part in the Uber Cup Team Event and the World Championships.

As she chases additional honors, Chen is looking forward to a fresh start after claiming her first Olympic gold, since holding one of badminton's biggest honors will leave her needing to dig deep to fend off the best shots from each and every challenger."
Tokyo 2020: BMX Freestyle cements extreme sports' Olympic arrival,"""BMX in the Olympics was never a goal from day one. I found out about it in 2018. So I kind of fell into doing that. It meant I could quit my job which was working full time in a kitchen,"" Worthington said.

Team Great Britain's Charlotte Worthington won gold in the women's event. Just three years ago, Worthington was working full time at a Mexican restaurant near Manchester in England. She received UK lottery funding once BMX freestyle was brought into the Olympic fold. She is now celebrating becoming the first-ever Olympic champion in BMX women's freestyle.

BMX Racing was introduced at the Beijing Olympics in 2008 and has grown in strength and popularity since then, gaining respectability along the way. BMX freestyle made its debut in Tokyo and looks set to stay.

Tokyo 2020 has welcomed a host of new events, many aimed at a younger demographic. Skateboarding and surfing both enjoyed successful debuts at the Olympic Games, capturing the imagination with some spectacular competition and incredible visuals.

The journey to the top was not straightforward for Worthington, who also has endured her fair share of injuries.

""It was actually only four weeks ago that I dislocated my shoulder. So, there were a lot of tough days. But to get here and get this was all worth it,"" she said.

Worthington's success was built on a 360-degree backflip. She fell on her first attempt, but landed on the second. It's the first time a woman has successfully completed the maneuver in a competition.

She added ""going into this, I set my sights on gold, and I knew that I had to do something special. It is very easy in BMX to back down from things. It is a very scary sport. But by the second run, I was thinking I have got to give myself a chance to do this. And as soon as I did that, and I got out of my own way, it just happened.""

Great Britain has enjoyed an immensely successful BMX campaign. A British athlete even won medals in all four BMX events. And that's likely to spur more interest in the sport both at home and globally.

""I think it will be showing extreme sports in a new light. There is definitely a stigma attached to them. And I think we are just proving that wrong. We are athletes in the same way Usain Bolt is an athlete. We work as hard. We sacrifice as hard. And then we reap the rewards,"" said Worthington.

It has been a fast turn around for Worthington, swapping a restaurant kitchen for the Olympic stage. But it's a recipe that others will be looking to emulate."
CGTN Sports Talk: Take it or leave it on NBA free agency market,"It did not take long for most NBA teams and players to reach agreements on contract extension, sign-and-trade, and other deals.

The Golden State Warriors extended the contract of Stephen Curry by another four years for $215 million.

The Miami Heat gave Jimmy Butler a four-year, $184-million extension and acquired Kyle Lowry on a three-year, $90-million deal via sign-and-trade.

The Chicago Bulls built their ""Big 3"" of Zach LaVine, Nikola Vucevic and DeMar DeRozan, who joined on a three-year, $85-million contract via sign-and-trade. Signing Lonzo Ball to a four-year, $85-million contract also made an eye-catching move.

The Phoenix Suns decided to reward Chris Paul's contribution last season with a four-year, $120-million new deal.

A late strike by Mauro Icardi earned Paris St Germain (PSG) a last-gasp 2-1 home victory against Olympique Lyonnais with Lionel Messi making limited impact on his Parc des Princes debut on Sunday. Icardi headed home from Kylian Mbappe's cross four minutes into stoppage time after Neymar had leveled with a penalty following Lucas Paqueta's second-half opener as leaders PSG maintained their perfect record with 18 points. Messi, in his third appearance for PSG, hit the woodwork but failed to score; he was substituted in the 76th minute. Messi's 25-meter curled free kick crashed onto the bar. He looked puzzled when he was replaced with fullback Achraf Hakimi, whose runs down the right flank were sorely missed by PSG.

Players, manager and working staff of Xinjiang pose with their silver medals after the U20 men's football final game at the Chinese National Games in Xiangyang, northwest China's Shaanxi Province, September 18, 2021. /CFP

When Xinjiang defeated Hubei in the penalty shootout at the end of the U20 men's football semifinal game at the Chinese National Games on Friday, Xinjiang's players made history by reaching the men's football final at the National Games for the first time in 62 years.

Though they lost to Zhejiang in the final 2-1 on Saturday, a silver medal is already the best proof that Xinjiang are one of the new reasons to continue to have faith in Chinese football.

Xinjiang's manager Parhat Azimat used to work was the assistant manager of the Chinese youth national team for a long time. That experience gave him a unique way of finding young talents. For example, Xinjiang's Nebijan Muhmet was the captain of China attending the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) U-20 Asian Cup qualifiers. Back Shewketjan Tayir was recruited by the Chinese youth team multiple times.

Moreover, football players from Xinjiang found their positions in multiple teams at the National Games and some of them are playing key roles. For instance, Abulahan Harik made great contributions for Shaanxi to winning to the U18 championship. The U18 Golden Boot winner Parmanjan Kyum is also from Xinjiang."
CGTN Sports Talk: Is the Champions League really the 'Super League?',"The idea of having a European Super League has long gone but the irony is, the UEFA Champions League has grown more and more like a ""Super League"" itself in the last decade.

It's getting harder and harder for surprises to be born in the Champions League and that is not a healthy development."
Xinjiang residents refute 'cultural genocide' claims,"""Heroes on horses, birds on wings,"" that's a proverb of the Kazakh ethnic minority group. Kazakh horseback riding is listed as one of China's intangible cultural heritages and is very popular among the Kazakh people in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.

Alibetti Haliyora is a horseback riding enthusiast from the city of Karamay in Xinjiang. He shared how villagers from his hometown enjoy and benefit from an annual racing event, their experiences practicing Xinjiang's traditional sports and how it helps spread the Kazakh culture at a press conference on Friday.

Alibetti said he read on the internet that some people with ill intentions say Xinjiang is engaged in ""cultural genocide.""

""This is nonsense!""said Alibetti.

He said the racing event has attracted many tourists and brought more money to their pockets, which made the villagers very happy and more eager to raise horses and do horse racing.

Other Xinjiang residents have also refuted Western allegations of ""cultural genocide"" and ""human rights violations"" in the region.

Tennur Ayidahan from Tacheng City proudly showed her son's certificate of merit and medal for playing local sport Daur Bako, or field hockey, with his school team.

Competitive sports have become popular in Xinjiang. Parhatti, a wrestling coach from the Karamay Amateur Sports School, introduced his career in competitive wrestling training. His student Walihan Sailike was the winner of the bronze medal in the 60-kilogram wrestling event at the Tokyo Olympics this year.

Parhatti said a traditional minority sports meeting is held every four years to promote and develop the sports culture of ethnic minorities. Sports talents from ethnic minority groups have always been selected and trained. Parhatti said they have sent many athletes to the national team and there are now eight athletes from Xinjiang on the Chinese national wrestling team.

Acrobatic sports including wheel trapeze and Darwaz ¨C or aerial tightrope walking ¨C were also introduced at the press conference.

Guhel Zeyiting of the Uygur ethnic minority group is a member of the Awat County Art Troupe. She introduced at the conference her exciting wheel trapeze competition experience. She and her teammates went to Guangzhou to participate in the 8th National Traditional Games of Ethnic Minorities in 2007. During the match, they pulled together and performed many skilled moves on fast spinning wheels in the air.

Sportsmanship has taken root in people's hearts and is showing strong vitality in Xinjiang with the support from both local and central governments.

According to the deputy director of Xinjiang's sports bureau, the General Administration of Sport of China has invested more than 1 billion yuan (some $150 million) to support sports development in the region over the past 10 years. The region now has 67,700 sports venues, with its per capita sports area of 2.03 square meters.

Residents in Xinjiang always welcome tourists to appreciate and learn more about their traditional sports culture."
Olympic champion Yang Qian on impressive debut at National Games,"Yang Qiang, who won two gold medals in shooting at the Tokyo Olympics, made her debut at the Chinese National Games in Xi'an, northwest China's Shaanxi Province, last week and claimed two golds and one bronze.

""It's been very successful National Games for her,"" said Ge Hongzhuan, Yang's coach. ""She is different to other athletes. To win two golds at the Olympics before winning two more at the National Games is a very difficult achievement. She is truly an outstanding athlete.""

Team China has been dominant in various shooting events for a long time. That's why domestic competitions are no easier than their international counterparts.

""The standard of shooting in our country is very high. It's just as high as in other international competitions,"" said Yang. ""In the women's individual 10-meter air rifle qualifying, one score of more than 630 didn't even get into the final. So I think our Chinese athletes are all very strong and some of them are in very good form.""

""Yang studies at Tsinghua University. She is an outstanding person to be able to study and train as an athlete. As coaches, we just follow basic routines and try to encourage all athletes to be well developed in all areas,"" Ge told CGTN.

There wasn't much time for Yang to switch her focus from the Tokyo Games to the National Games, especially with COVID-19 still present. However, the 20-year-old still managed to do it on short notice and had a great performance in Xi'an.

""Taking part in large-scale competitions like the Olympics and the National Games is a very valuable experience for all athletes. It's also good for our future development, but what's important to me, is that I get to learn how to maintain my normal standard of performance under stressful circumstances at stimulating competitions,"" said Yang."

Macao karateka Kuok Kin Hang made history on Saturday, delivering the Macao Special Administrative Region's first ever medal at China's National Games in the men's karate.

""I'm glad to take this honor. It's a special moment for Macao sports. It means that Macao athletes can do something on this big stage,"" said Kuok.

The 28-year-old was close to winning a medal at the 18th Asian Games in Jakarta, where he lost to South Korea's Park Hee-hun in the men's karate kata competition.

""I kept pushing myself and didn't eat too much yesterday. It's my first time competing at the National Games, and I was hungry to win a medal for my team,"" he said.

""I'm so glad to compete with other Chinese competitors on such a huge stage, since I haven't had any events outside Macao because of the pandemic,"" Kuok added."

Trayvon Bromell ran the fastest 100 meters of 2021 by winning the Kup Keino Classic in 9.76 seconds in Nairobi on Saturday.

Bromell was considered a title favorite before the Tokyo Olympics with his then world-leading time of 9.77 seconds but failed to reach the final of the men's 100 meters, clocking 10.00 in the semis.

The 26-year-old American got over the disappointment of the unsuccessful Olympics campaign in the final World Athletics Continental Tour Gold series event of the year. He finished faster than home favorite Kenyan athletics star Ferdinand Omanyala who finished in 9.77 seconds and set a new African record, smashing the previous record of 9.84 seconds set by Akani Simbine of South Africa.

""I may not have grabbed the gold in Tokyo, but where I come from, I've already won,"" Bromell said in an Instagram post.

""I pray that I can continue to show you all that no matter what you go through, no one on this Earth can control your fate.""

The 2004 Olympic champion Justin Gatlin came third in the ranking. He canceled his retirement plan afterward but retained the possibility of taking a long break coming back from injury.

""Hopefully, let's wait and see what's in store for the new season,"" he said when asked if he planned to hang up his spikes.

Bologna sit eighth on seven points after their first defeat of the season, made no better by Arthur Theate's late consolation goal. ""I was worried about this match because after a game like the one with Madrid, in which we definitely deserved more, there was a bit of worry (for the reaction),"" said Inzaghi to DAZN. ""But the boys approached the game in the best way possible.""

Jurgen Klopp saluted Sadio Mane after the Senegal star's 100th Liverpool goal inspired a 3-0 win against Crystal Palace that sent his side top of the Premier League on Saturday. Mane's milestone strike came in his 224th appearance for the Reds, breaking Palace's rearguard action late in the first half at Anfield. Egypt forward Mohamed Salah and Guinea midfielder Naby Keita netted in the second half to move Klopp's team three points clear of second-placed Manchester City. ""People forget around these 100 goals he worked incredibly hard, defended for us, pressed high, counter-pressed, created goals, set up chances, so the 100 goals are just one, there are so many numbers that are important,"" Klopp said. ""I am really happy for him he could reach it, a massive achievement in the glorious history of this club that only 18 players scored 100 goals. Nowadays, players are not normally as long at clubs, so I am really happy I could work so long with him."" Defending champions Manchester City dropped two points at home to Southampton after a 0-0 stalemate while struggling Wolves lost their fourth match in five against 10-man Brentford.

Where can John Wall go after reaching farewell agreement with Houston?,"John Wall of the Houston Rockets handles the ball in the game against the Indiana Pacers at Tokyo Center in Houston, Texas, U.S., April 14, 2021. /CFP John Wall of the Houston Rockets handles the ball in the game against the Indiana Pacers at Tokyo Center in Houston, Texas, U.S., April 14, 2021. /CFP

It has been never a secret that John Wall was never part of the Houston Rockets' future since the team traded Russell Westbrook for him in December 2020. The fact that the Washington Wizards had to add four (protected) first-round draft picks to convince the Rockets to accept Wall already proved that he is a negative asset. The peaceful parting agreement he reached with the Rockets was worth praising, but hardly made it any easier for the team to get rid of him. So, what's standing in the way of a 31-year-old five-time NBA All-Star point guard finding a new team to play for?

First, it's his big contract. Wall still has two years left of his current deal and they are worth $91.7 million (player option in 2022 summer). His salary of $44.3 million for the 2021-22 season is the second-highest in the league, only next to the $45.8 million of Stephen Curry, more than what James Harden, Kevin Durant and LeBron James are paid. Wall averaged 20.6 points, 6.9 assists and 2.0 triples at 31.7 percent in 40 games last season. He did not play at all in the 2019-20 season due to injury. The same problem cost him 50 and 41 games respectively in the previous two seasons and took away Wall's biggest weapon, his speed which enabled him to finish 40-yard dash at 4.35 seconds. Moreover, Wall has never been a reliable shooter ¨C either for catch-and-shoot or shoot off the dribble ¨C since he joined the NBA in 2010. 2020-21 was already his most productive season at the 3-point line where he buried two shots per game, but at only 31.7 percent.

So it's safe to say that Wall's contribution today to his team can't match the money they pay him. A buyout does not sound likely either. For example, if Wall gives up $10 million and agrees to receive it for five years, that's over $16 million of dead space on the team's payroll for five years. It will deprive them of the ability to make any remarkable enhancements for a longer time than the rookie deal of a promising young man. No team will do that to themselves. It can be argued that in the NBA, many things are overpriced, especially when you are in desperate need for it. So are there any teams willing to bet on Wall for their solution to the point guard position? The Dallas Mavericks may be one. Luka Doncic is in the last years of his rookie deal and the team's bet on Kristaps Porzingis obviously failed. They need someone who can at least share the orchestrating burden with Doncic. Is it a good deal for Wall and Porzingis to switch sides?

The Rockets may not want that. Even if they keep Wall for another two seasons, they will still be able to clean huge salary space in 2023 summer when they will have no contract bigger than $10 million. Nonetheless, if the Rockets replace Wall with Porzingis, that's over $36 million of occupied space on their payroll for the 2023-24 season. The Los Angeles Clippers are another team that is one piece of puzzle away from the champion squad. But their salaries are already exploding ($167.5), not to mention that Kawhi Leonard will not play this season. How ridiculously excellent will Paul George have to be to convince the Clippers' front office that it's worth to burn money landing Wall? The Philadelphia 76ers also have their name related to Wall and they have a perfect trading match for Wall ¨C Ben Simmons. But if you have been following trade rumors about Simmons, you should recall that the 76ers ask for an All-Star player and multiple (at least four) first-rounders in return. Is Wall an All-Star? Absolutely no. Are the Rockets willing to give multiple first-rounders? According to ESPN's Tim MacMahon, they don't even want to include one first-round pick in Wall trade.

One may also argue that there are teams in the league willing to swallow toxic contracts like the Oklahoma City Thunder or the Detroit Pistons. Unfortunately, there is a price for their help and it's too large for the Rockets to pay. If the Thunder take in Wall, which they are totally capable of, they will create a $30+million trade exception for the Rockets. It remains unclear how many future draft picks it make take for the Thunder to agree to do so, but it's more than enough to clean the Rockets' bank account for first-rounders. The Pistons won't be in any conversation with the Rockets because their salary space is already filled with dead money from buyout deals with Blake Griffin, Deandre Jordan and others.

Pep Guardiola, manager of Premier League's Manchester City, said he won't apologize for urging more fans to attend the home game against Southampton at Etihad Stadium on Saturday. Man City hosted and beat Red Bull Leipzig 6-3 in their first UEFA Champions League game on Wednesday in front of some 38,000 fans at the 54,000-seat Etihad. ""I would like more people to come to the next game on Saturday. We will need the people next Saturday, please, because we will be tired. I invite all our people to come next Saturday, 3 p.m. (10 a.m. ET), and watch the game,"" said Guardiola after the game.

The call for attendance however upset City's official supporters' club and its General Secretary Kevin Parker, who told Guardiola to stick to coaching in response. ""He doesn't understand the difficulties that some people might have getting to a game at the Etihad on a Wednesday evening at 8:00 p.m. [BST]. They have got kids to think of, they might not be able to afford it, there are still some COVID issues about... I don't see why he comments on it. He's absolutely the best coach in the world but, in the nicest possible way, I think maybe he should stick to that,"" said Parker. Though Man City won the Premier League title in three of the past four seasons and reached the Champions League Final last season, they rarely saw a fully-seated home stadium, which separated them from other heavyweights like Liverpool, Chelsea and of course, Manchester United.

COVID continues to hit football as Derby set to enter administration,"Former English champions Derby County have become the latest victim of economic distress exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic following an announcement that they are set to go into administration and face the prospect of a 21-point deduction for breaching financial fair play rules.



In a statement, Derby said, ""Last week, it became clear that the process which has been under way to identify a purchaser for the club likely would not be productive over the near term, despite negotiations with credible parties.



""Because the COVID-19 pandemic has had a severe impact on the revenues and profits of all of its businesses, the club has been unable to service its day-to-day financial obligations. The directors had no choice but to make the tough decision to take this action and protect the club.



""The irony is that the club's financial forecasts show the emergence of a financially sustainable picture. Absent the COVID-19 pandemic, we undoubtedly would have been able to trade through. The club's revenues and cash flow took a circa ?20 million ($27.4 million) hit.

""We cannot stress enough how devastating it is to be forced into this position. We will continue our work under the stewardship of the administrators to help facilitate their process and their effort to find a purchaser,"" it concluded."
Football legend Pele 'recovering well' after re-entering ICU,"Brazilian football legend Pele, 80, was briefly transferred back to an intensive care unit on Friday after suffering breathing difficulties but is now stable, said the Albert Einstein Hospital in Sao Paulo, where he underwent surgery earlier this month.

The transfer was a temporary ""preventative measure,"" the hospital said in a statement, adding that the sporting great was later transferred to ""semi-intensive care"" as he continues to recover from surgery for a suspected colon tumor.

""He is currently stable from a cardiovascular and respiratory point of view,"" it added.

Shortly afterwards, the ex-footballer posted a message on social media stating: ""Friends, I am still recovering very well. Today I received visits from family and I am still smiling every day.""

Pele's daughter Kely Nascimento also posted a photo of herself next to her father in the hospital, seeking to cheer up his fans.

""This is the normal recovery scenario for a man his age. After an operation like this, sometimes you take two steps forward, one step back,"" Nascimento wrote on Instagram next to the photo. ""Yesterday he was tired and he took a step back. Today, he has taken two steps forward,"" she added.

In the photo, Pele is seen on what looks like a hospital bed in a black puff vest or jacket, alert and smiling.

""He is recovering well, under normal conditions, I promise!"" Nascimento added. ""There is a lot of angst in the world these days and we don't want to add to it.""

On September 6 the hospital said Pele had undergone surgery for a suspected colon tumor.

He originally left the ICU unit on Tuesday, telling his fans on social media that he was feeling happier by the day and was looking forward to reuniting with them.

The suspected tumor was detected during routine tests, according to the hospital, where Pele has been undergoing treatment since August 31.

Considered by many to be the greatest footballer of all time, Pele, whose real name is Edson Arantes do Nascimento, has been in poor health in recent years, and has had various stints in the hospital.

The only player in history to win three World Cups (1958, 1962 and 1970), Pele burst onto the global stage at just 17 with dazzling goals, including two in the final against hosts Sweden, as Brazil won the World Cup for the first time in 1958.

Four years later, Pele gave a tantalizing glimpse of his ability with an electric individual goal against Mexico in Brazil's opening 2-0 win. He went on to have one of the most storied careers in sport, scoring more than 1,000 goals before retiring in 1977."

Rio de Janeiro in Brazil prepares to bid for the rights to host this year's FIFA Club World Cup, according to an official of the city on Thursday.

It is now unclear what city will take over the baton from Japan, after the Japanese Football Association announced it will relinquish its hosting rights due to COVID-19 concerns.

Brazil recently eased its COVID-19 restrictions amid a fall in infection rates and fatalities caused by the virus, whereas the Japanese government decided last week to extend the COVID-19 state of emergency in many parts of the country as it hoped to suppress the latest wave of infections.

""We are starting talks so that the final of the Club World Cup can be held [here],"" Rio's finance and planning secretary Pedro Paulo told Band News.

According to Paulo, should the city be granted the opportunity, the matches will likely be held at the Maracana and Olympic stadiums.

Three clubs have already qualified for this year's Club World Cup, including Al-Ahly, Chelsea and Auckland City as the champions of Africa, Europe and Oceania, respectively. The competition will also feature the winners of this year's continental club tournaments in Asia, South America and North and Central America and the Caribbean, as well as the reigning champions of the host nation's top league."

FIFA throws weight behind biennial World Cup plan with new survey,"While a number of high-profile players, coaches and even UEFA, football's European governing body, have expressed strong disapproval of the radical proposal to hold a World Cup every two years, FIFA still refuses to back down. In an attempt to validate the feasibility of a biennial World Cup, football's world governing body unveiled a survey carried out by polling company YouGov on Thursday and highlighted the fact that the majority of respondents are in favor of increasing the frequency of World Cups. The survey involved 23,000 people in 23 countries, across the organisation's six confederations. Of those, 15,000 respondents ""were identified as expressing an interest in football and the World Cup,"" with 55 percent in favor of a World Cup every one, two or three years, according to FIFA. ""There are considerable differences between the so-called traditional markets and the developing football markets; and younger generations in all regions are more open and interested in change than older generations,"" it said in a statement, adding that an expanded survey involving over 100,000 people in more than 100 countries ""is currently underway.""

Last week, UEFA President Aleksander Ceferin warned that his confederation could boycott the World Cup if the plan went ahead. ""We can decide not to play in it,"" he told The Times. ""As far as I know the South Americans are on the same page, so good luck with a World Cup like that.""



""I think it will never happen as it is so much against the basic principles of football. To play every summer a one-month tournament, for the players it's a killer. If it's every two years it clashes with the Women's World Cup, with the Olympic football tournament. The value is precisely because it is every four years, you wait for it. It's like the Olympic Games, it's a huge event. I don't see our federations supporting that,"" he added.



""I hope they (FIFA) will come to their senses because I don't see the right approach to go everywhere except the confederations, not to speak to us. They didn't come, they didn't call, I didn't get a letter or anything. I just read in the media,"" Ceferin fumed.



The stance was echoed by global players' union FIFPRO, which announced via a statement that it would not endorse any individual reforms such as shortening the gap between World Cups in isolation without an overarching review of the men's and women's calendar.

""Without the agreement of the players, who bring all competitions to life on the pitch, no such reforms will have the required legitimacy,"" read the statement."

Victor Osimhen scored twice as Napoli came from 2-0 down to salvage a 2-2 draw at Leicester, while Lyon cruised to a 2-0 win at Rangers on the opening night of the Europa League group stages on Thursday.

Earlier, Celtic threw away a two-goal lead to lose 4-3 to Real Betis and West Ham were convincing 2-0 winners away to Dinamo Zagreb.

Leicester just missed out on Champions League football for a second consecutive season as they finished fifth in the Premier League last term. But the Foxes are keen to go further than their run to the last 32 of the Europa League last season and got off to a great start against the Italian giants.

Ayoze Perez fired home at the back post from Harvey Barnes' cross after just nine minutes. Patson Daka then saw his first Leicester goal ruled out by a VAR review for a marginal offside call, but Barnes quickly put that disappointment behind Brendan Rodgers' men with an excellent finish to double Leicester's lead.

Napoli boss Luciano Spalletti held nothing in reserve with his strongest side and the visitors responded in the final quarter thanks to Osimhen.

The Nigerian, who cost $83 million from Lille last year, brilliantly flicked the ball over the imposing presence of Jannik Vestegaard and Kasper Schmeichel to get Napoli back in the game.

Osimhen then outjumped Caglar Soyuncu to power home a head for a deserved equalizer. And Leicester's night got even worse in stoppage time when Wilfred Ndidi was sent off in stoppage time for a second bookable offence."

The Denver Nuggets gave a four-year, $92-million contract extension to Aaron Gordon, according to the Undefeated's Marc J. Spears, who talked to Gordon's agent Calvin Andrews of Klutch Sports. That became the last major move of the team during this offseason. Before that, the Nuggets also retained Austin Rivers, JaMychal Green, Will Barton and added Jeff Green and JaVale McGee to their roster. Meanwhile, they let Paul Millsap depart for the Brooklyn Nets. Simply speaking, the Nuggets made an upgrade on offense at the cost of defense.

The arrival of Jeff Green enriched the team's offensive weapons. He was able to get 14.7 points, 5.2 rebounds and two triples at 41.2 percent per 36 minutes last season with the Nets. He's a more efficient scoring option than Millsap. Considering that Jeff Green will probably start off the bench, his screen plays with Facundo Campazzo could be very smooth with his impressive rolling techniques. The team will also have Jamal Murray back, who suffered a torn ACL in his left knee in April. If he returns 100 percent healthy, Murray is able to take the Nuggets' offense to another level. His incredible off-the-dribble shooting ability plus the screen-setting and passing skills of Nikola Jokic will make one of the sharpest pick-and-roll duos in today's NBA. One of the reasons the Nuggets were knocked out by the Phoenix Suns in the playoffs last season was that they had no reliable perimeter scoring options when Jokic's isolation threat was resolved by Deandre Ayton.

However, the Nuggets are very likely to be a below-average team defensively in the 2021-22 season. They allowed 110.1 points (eighth of all 30 teams) per game with a defensive rating of 112.1 (12th of 30). The team will probably keep the starting lineup of Murray, Barton, Michael Porter Jr., Gordon and Jokic in the new season, the same from 2020-21. The problem is with the bench squad. When Millsap was still with the Nuggets, he could make consistent contributions in stealing, blocking and switch defense. Jeff Green was unable to provide any of that. Of course, McGee can fill the paint, but he only received an average of 13.5 minutes per game last season, not to mention he lacks shooting range and the ability to switch on defense.

Olympic champion Simone Biles and other top American gymnasts excoriated U.S. sports officials and the FBI in powerful Senate testimony on Wednesday for failing to act promptly on complaints about Larry Nassar, the former team doctor convicted of serial sexual abuse. ""We have been failed, and we deserve answers,"" said the 24-year-old Biles, a seven-time Olympic medalist and the most decorated gymnast in world championships history. ""To be clear, I blame Larry Nassar, but I also blame an entire system that enabled and perpetrated his abuse,"" she said during an emotional hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Nassar, 58, was sentenced to life in prison in 2018 after pleading guilty to sexually assaulting women and girls while working as a team doctor at USA Gymnastics and Michigan State University (MSU). USA Gymnastics reported Nassar to the FBI in July 2015, but he continued to work at MSU and sexually abused at least 70 more women until a newspaper exposed him in September 2016 Biles and the three other gymnasts, McKayla Maroney, Aly Raisman and Maggie Nichols, testified that they were let down by the FBI, the leadership of USA Gymnastics and the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee (USOPC).

""We suffered and continue to suffer because no one at the FBI, USAG or USOPC did what was necessary to protect us,"" said Biles, who had to halt her testimony at several points to compose herself and wipe away tears. Maroney, who won a team gold medal at the 2012 London Olympics, said she reported the abuse by Nassar in a three-hour telephone interview with a FBI agent in 2015, but it was ""minimized and disregarded."" ""Not only did the FBI not report my abuse,"" Maroney said. ""But when they eventually documented my report 17 months later, they made entirely false claims about what I said. They allowed a child molester to go free for more than a year. They had legal, legitimate evidence of child abuse and did nothing."" Hundreds of women, including Olympians and collegiate athletes, have accused Nassar of sexually abusing them over the course of his more than two-decade career in sports medicine.

The Justice Department's Inspector General published a scathing report in July about the mishandling of the accusations against Nassar by the FBI's field office in Indianapolis, where USA Gymnastics has its headquarters. FBI agents failed to take the allegations seriously and investigate them right away, the report said. Biles, Maroney, Raisman and Nichols were invited to testify before the Senate committee under oath about the ""FBI's dereliction of duty in the Nassar case."" Raisman, former captain of the Olympic gold medal-winning 2012 and 2016 U.S. teams, said stopping Nassar's abuse should have been a priority for the FBI, but it took over 14 months for the bureau to contact her. Raisman said the delay was ""like serving innocent children up to a pedophile on a silver platter."" Nichols, who won a gold medal at the 2015 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships, said she reported Nassar's abuse to USA Gymnastics leadership in 2015.

""I am haunted by the fact that even after I reported my abuse so many women and girls had to suffer at the hands of Larry Nassar,"" she said. ""USA Gymnastics and the United States Olympic and Paralympic Committee have all betrayed me and those who were abused by Larry Nassar,"" the 24-year-old said. FBI Director Christopher Wray also testified before the Senate panel but in a separate session. Wray apologized to the gymnasts and others abused by Nassar for the FBI's mishandling of the investigation. ""In no planet is what happened in this case acceptable,"" he said. ""I'm sorry so many people let you down over and over again,"" Wray said. ""And I am especially sorry that there were people at the FBI who had their own chance to stop this monster back in 2015 and failed. That is inexcusable."" Wray said the senior agent in Indianapolis who failed to properly investigate Nassar had retired while another agent had been fired.

China's fervor for sports continues with opening of 'mini Olympics',"00:22

The passion for sports in China reached a new height on Wednesday evening as the country's most important multisport event kicked off in Xi'an, capital of northwest China's Shaanxi Province.



""I declare open the 14th National Games of the People's Republic of China,"" Chinese President Xi Jinping announced at the opening ceremony of the quadrennial Games, dubbed as China's ""mini Olympics.""



The event comes amid a busy national sporting calendar. At the Tokyo Olympics from July to August, China won 38 golds, 32 silvers and 18 bronzes, equaling its haul of gold medals at London 2012 for the best performance at an overseas Olympics. The country topped the medal tally at the Tokyo Paralympic Games that concluded earlier this month with 207 medals (96 golds, 60 silvers and 51 bronzes).



Moreover, Beijing will host the Winter Olympic Games in next February and become the first city to host both summer and winter Olympics.

'True champion'

Inaugurated in 1959, the National Games is the most prestigious domestic sporting gala in China. Under the theme of ""Games for All, Together in Mind and Action,"" the 14th National Games features a total of 54 sports and 595 events, of which 35 sports and 410 events are for elite athletes, with the remainder mass sports programs.



More than 12,000 athletes representing China's provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions, the Hong Kong and Macao Special Administrative Regions, the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps and specific sporting associations will compete at the Games, which will run through to September 27.

Chinese President Xi Jinping greets individuals and groups advancing China's sporting cause, both professionals and amateurs, as well as representatives of the athletes and coaches from the Chinese Olympic delegation for Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games, in Xi'an, capital of northwest China's Shaanxi Province, September 15, 2021. /Xinhua Chinese President Xi Jinping greets individuals and groups advancing China's sporting cause, both professionals and amateurs, as well as representatives of the athletes and coaches from the Chinese Olympic delegation for Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games, in Xi'an, capital of northwest China's Shaanxi Province, September 15, 2021. /Xinhua

It was the third time that President Xi has attended the opening ceremony of the Games since becoming Chinese president in 2013.



A keen sports fan, he is interested in a variety of sports, including soccer, volleyball and swimming. He has placed sports high on his agenda during his activities inside the country and abroad. He has visited venues for the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics, met with representatives of the Chinese women's volleyball team, attended the opening ceremony of the Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics, and watched a youth soccer match in Germany.



He has also talked with the world's top sports officials such as International Olympic Committee (IOC) President Thomas Bach, president of the F¨¦d¨¦ration Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) Gianni Infantino and president of the International Basketball Federation (FIBA) Horacio Muratore.



""President Xi is a true champion and I want to give him a set of medals because he has a clear vision about the important role of sports in society, and the importance of sports for education for the young people. So in this respect, he is the true Olympic champion for the youth,"" Bach told reporters when Xi paid a visit to the IOC headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland in 2017.

Sports powerhouse

Since winning its first Olympic gold medal in 1984, China has made remarkable progress in sports ¨C not just in competitions, but among hundreds of millions of ordinary Chinese.



The hosting major international sporting events, including the Beijing 1990 Asian Games, the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games and the 2015 World Championships in Athletics, has greatly boosted fervor for sports among the public, as has the development of professional sports leagues in China.

Lionel Messi made his first Paris Saint-Germain start in a 1-1 draw at Club Brugge in the Champions League on Wednesday, while last season's runners-up Manchester City and Liverpool won high-scoring thrillers.

Real Madrid, the record 13-time European champions, left it late to beat Inter Milan at the San Siro in a section topped by Moldovan debutants Sheriff Tiraspol after the first round of group stage matches.

Argentine star Messi lined up with both Neymar and Kylian Mbappe for the first time, after being limited to just 24 minutes in a PSG shirt since his shock exit from Barcelona.

Ander Herrera, who scored twice in the weekend win over Clermont, gave PSG the lead by steering in Mbappe's cross on 15 minutes, but Brugge soon leveled through Hans Vanaken.

Messi curled against the bar from the corner of the area but PSG then lost Mbappe to injury and had to settle for a point against a team viewed as makeweights in a demanding Group A."

Robert Lewandowski and Thomas Mueller fired Bayern Munich to a 3-0 victory over Barcelona in a season opener of the Champions League on Tuesday.

Mueller gave Bayern the lead in the 34th minute with a strike from outside the area which deflected off Barca defender Eric Garcia to confound goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen.

Lewandowski scored the second goal in the 54th, tapping into the net from close range on the rebound after Jamal Musiala had hit the post as Bayern made a rampant start following the interval, hemming their hosts into their own half.

The Polish striker twisted the knife further into Barcelona by scoring again in the 85th, collecting the ball in the area after another shot had come back off the post and tormenting the defense before calmly beating Ter Stegen."

British sprinter Chijindu Ujah's B-sample from the Tokyo Olympics has been tested positive, the International Testing Agency (ITA) said on Tuesday, confirming his previous test result of A-sample containing two banned substances, Ostarine and S-23, a week after the Games ended. Ujah has been provisionally suspended since.

Both substances are classified by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) as selective androgen receptor modulator (SARM) with effects similar to anabolic steroids.

CJ Ujah was a member of the Team GB men's 4x100m team along with Zharnel Hughes, Richard Kilty and Nethaneel Mitchell-Blake, who won silver in Tokyo. They are now at risk of losing the medal.

Ujah's case has been referred to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). Should the ban be upheld, next in line to be upgraded for the silver and bronze medals, respectively, are Team Canada and Team China, that finished third and fourth in the event's final at the Tokyo Olympics.

""The CAS Anti-Doping Division will consider the matter of the finding of an Anti-Doping Rule Violation (ADRV) and the disqualification of the men's 4x100 relay results of the Great Britain team,"" the ITA said in a statement.

""In this regard, pursuant to the IOC ADR (International Olympic Committee Anti-Doping Rules) and the World Athletics Anti-Doping Rules: 'where the athlete who has committed an Anti-Doping Rule Violation competed as a member of a relay team, the relay team shall be automatically disqualified from the event in question'.""

""The case will then be referred to the Athletics Integrity Unit (World Athletics) to follow up on sanctions beyond the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020.""

Will Chicago Bulls make any difference with 3 NBA All-Stars?,"L-R: Nikola Vucevic, Zach LaVine and DeMar DeRozan, the new Big 3 of the Chicago Bulls. /CFP L-R: Nikola Vucevic, Zach LaVine and DeMar DeRozan, the new Big 3 of the Chicago Bulls. /CFP

The Chicago Bulls are definitely after something big, landing DeMar DeRozan, Lonzo Ball and Alex Caruso during the off-season, bigger than convincing Zach LaVine to sign a contract extension when they traded for Nikola Vucevic in the second half of last season. It may not sound like it, but the Bulls have their own version of the ""Big 3"" now: DeRozan: four-time NBA All-Star, All-NBA Second Team and Third Team once each Vucevic: two-time All Star LaVine: All-Star

Zach LaVine (#8) of the Chicago Bulls drives toward the rim in the game against the Toronto Raptors at United Center in Chicago, Illoinois, U.S., May 13, 2021. /CFP Zach LaVine (#8) of the Chicago Bulls drives toward the rim in the game against the Toronto Raptors at United Center in Chicago, Illoinois, U.S., May 13, 2021. /CFP

If you put Ball into the starting lineup, you will see the Bulls have four starters with the following stats from the 2020-21 season: Ball: 14.6 points, 4.8 rebounds, 5.7 assists, 1.6 steals and 3.1 triples at 37.8 percent per game LaVine: 27.4 points, 5.0 rebounds, 4.9 assists and 3.4 triples at 41.9 percent per game DeRozan: 21.6 points, 4.2 rebounds and 6.9 assists per game Vucevic: 21.5 points, 11.5 rebounds, 3.9 assists and 2.3 triples at 38.8 percent Moreover, the playstyles of the four fit each other quite well. LaVine is the productive scorer who can ignore defense; DeRozan is the isolation choice in the middle range with decent orchestrating ability; Ball is a big point guard who doesn't have to hold the ball in his hands too much and a reliable 3-point shooter; Vucevic has the complete offensive weapons of a big man and he can stretch the spacing for the team. Bulls fans will no doubt be eager for the new season to begin now.

But there are reasons why they shouldn't get too excited. For example, of the four only Vucevic played five playoff games in the past two seasons. The other three played a grand total of zero. DeRozan only had one ""plus"" season in Defensive Box Plus/Minus (DBPM), having played 12 years in the NBA. LaVine had none. Both must be on the court for at least 35 minutes per game for the sake of the team's offense. Things look even worse if you go into the details. Vucevic was exposed as more of a guy to tussle with the opponents' big man for rebounding instead of a true rim protector. LaVine has never been a qualified defender in his career; neither has DeRozan, not to mention that he will have to play as a small forward and face guys who are always bigger and stronger than him. Usually it takes an elite defender in the power forward position to save such a squad, but the Bulls have no player of this type.

Neither are they able to make a balanced squad. As mentioned earlier, LaVine, DeRozan, Ball and Vucevic are likely to appear in the starting squad. But the question is, who will join them? Caruso should be considered in this but he is a back-court player, just like Ball, LaVine and DeRozan. Derrick Jones Jr. may be another option but he is still undersized to play as a power forward. There is more cold water to be thrown on Bulls fans if they look at the environment in the Eastern Conference. The Brooklyn Nets, led by Kevin Durant, James Harden and Kyrie Irving, the defending champions Milwaukee Bucks, plus Joel Embiid and the Philadelphia 76ers will occupy the top three spots of this conference. The Miami Heat may not match those three teams but they are above the rest in the East. Trae Young and the Atlanta Hawks just made the Eastern Finals last season and they have kept a very young, competitive roster. The New York Knicks were No. 4 in the regular season and had a top-2 defense of the league. The Boston Celtics are in an awkward situation but their star duo, Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown have a way more balanced combination of offense and defense than DeRozan-LaVine. That's already seven teams that are surely better than the Bulls. The NBA will continue to arrange a play-in tournament for playoff qualification. That means the Bulls may face the Indiana Pacers, the Washington Wizards or the Charlotte Hornets. How confident are the Bulls that they can absolutely beat any of the three in a one-game series?

Jia Xiuquan, manager of the Chinese women's national football team, is set to resign and the Chinese Football Association (CFA) has already started looking for a successor, domestic newspaper Football reported on Tuesday. Jia is currently on vacation after the Tokyo Olympics. Most of the national team's players will attend the Chinese National Games, kicking off Wednesday in Xi'an, northwest China's Shaanxi Province, with Shui Qingxia as manager, Football reported. Whether Shui could become Jia's replacement was unclear. China's performance in Tokyo under Jia was disastrous: losing to Brazil 5-0, to the Netherlands 8-2 and then forced into a 4-4 draw against Zambia.

Jia had brought many young players to Tokyo, rather than veteran core members, defending his decision by calling the Olympics a drill. This could cost him his job as manager of the national team, although Jia himself has not said much about his future in the coaching position.

Formula One's governing body will investigate Sunday's Italian Grand Prix crash between title contenders Max Verstappen and Lewis Hamilton because it was 'unusual,' according to race director Michael Masi.

Masi said although the collision was relatively low-speed, the FIA's safety experts would still look into it.

""Incidents that are different, so it's not necessarily high G impacts or anything like that, but are unusual, we do look at,"" said Masi.

The crash had Verstappen's Red Bull lift up off a curb and land on Hamilton's Mercedes with the inside of a rear wheel hitting the seven-time world champion's helmet through the protective halo.

""Our safety department does look at them in detail, investigate and see what we can learn and what we can improve for the future. That's how we have a whole lot of the safety features that we have today and will continue to evolve into the future.""

""We are already collecting all of the data, so we have all of the information, and that will all go to our safety department together with any photographs and anything else we have along the way.""

The Monza stewards blamed championship leader Verstappen and handed the Dutch 23-year-old a three-place grid drop for the next race in Russia.

Hamilton said it had been a shock to be hit on the head and that the titanium ring had saved his life.

""I'm so, so grateful that I'm still here. I feel incredibly blessed. I feel like someone was watching over me today,"" said the Briton.

Several other F1 drivers have also credited the device for saving their lives over the past years, including Ferrari's Charles Leclerc and former Haas racer Romain Grosjean.

""I think it's the greatest thing that we brought to Formula One,"" said Grosjean after the device shielded his head when his car crashed into the barriers in a fiery crash in Bahrain last year.

Each year, the top eight men's singles and doubles players qualify for the season-ending event. Medvedev earned his berth after denying world number one Novak Djokovic's hope of achieving a calendar-year Grand Slam in New York.

""I look forward to trying and defending my title in Turin,"" Medvedev said in an ATP statement. ""Italian fans are so passionate; I am sure it will be a great event.""

Djokovic has already qualified for the finals, before anyone else, after clinching all three other Grand Slam titles this year in the Australian Open, French Open and Wimbledon Championships. Djokovic has won the finals five times.

World number two Tsitsipas, who won the ATP Finals in 2019, has again joined the competition.

""It is great to qualify for Turin so early; I can't wait to play there,"" said Tsitsipas, who has won a tour-leading 50 matches in the 2021 season.

Cornerback Marshon Lattimore has agreed to a five-year, $97.6-million contract extension offered by the New Orleans Saints, according to ESPN's Adam Schefter. The new deal contains $68.3 million of guaranteed money, the largest full guarantee at signing for any player in Lattimore's position in NFL history.

Keeping one of the team's core players plus the 38-3 big win over the Green Bay Packers in the season opener gave Packers fans more reasons to cheer.

He did not start at the beginning of the third quarter and was spotted with a brace on his hand when he returned.

The Saints managed to retain several key members of their roster despite facing severe salary-cap limitations.

Jose Mourinho said he felt like a child when he charged from his dugout to celebrate Stephan El Shaarawy's last-gasp winner in a thrilling 2-1 victory over Sassuolo, which put his side at the top of Serie A in his 1,000th match as a manager.

Italy international El Shaarawy struck with a sublime curling strike in the 91st minute, which caused wild celebrations at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome, with Mourinho running to join his joyous players in front of screaming supporters behind the goal.

""Today I wasn't 58 years old, I felt like a 10, 12, 14-year-old, back when you begin to dream about a career in football. It was a child's run,"" Mourinho told DAZN.

""During the week I lied to myself because I tried to convince myself that wasn't a special match but it was a special match... For the rest of my life I will remember that the match that took me to 1,000 was this one.""

A breathless contest looked to be heading for a draw after Bryan Cristante's 37th-minute opener was cancelled out by Filip Djuricic just before the hour mark and both sides wasted a raft of chances.

Tammy Abraham and Hamed Traore hit the post for each team but it was Roma goalkeeper Rui Patricio who had to be at his best to stop gilt-edged opportunities presented to Domenico Berardi and Jeremie Boga as Sassuolo pushed for a win.

However, with the seconds ticking away El Shaarawy crashed in his shot from the edge of the area off the post to put Roma top, level on a perfect nine points with AC Milan and Napoli."

In professional tennis, much like other elite sports, the ""shelf life"" is short ¨C just ask the seasoned veterans who fell victim to the 18-year-old British sensation Emma Raducanu's ruthless backhand and serve. However, from time to time, experience triumphs over youth.



With the combined age of 69, China's 32-year-old Zhang Shuai and Aussie old-timer Samantha Stosur, ensured that the changing of the guard would not happen in the women's doubles final at this year's rejuvenated U.S. Open, as the pair produced a near-flawless performance to outclass American teens Coco Gauff and Catherine McNally 6-3, 3-6, 6-3 on Sunday night.



It was Zhang's second Grand Slam doubles title after winning the Australian Open trophy with Stosur in 2019. ""I'm the only one for Chinese people in draw this year,"" said Zhang, who has come under huge pressure to deliver. ""[Winning the title] is so special.""



The sentiment was echoed by Stosur, who won the 2005 U.S. Open with American Lisa Raymond. ""I can't believe I'm standing here with this trophy again 16 years later,"" Stosur said. ""It has been an incredible two weeks.""



""We were playing again a couple of youngsters who even though, they're so young, but they've got quite a bit of experience,"" Stosur added. ""They just play fearless. Credit goes to them. I think they're a really great team. Again, no doubt they're going to be back in situations like this, challenging for titles. Not just yet, not today.""

In contrast, another old stager Novak Djokovic was left in a somber mood. The world number one's dream of completing a calendar sweep of the Grand Slams was shattered by Daniil Medvedev in a tense men's singles final later in the day.



Medvedev's 6-4, 6-4, 6-4 victory makes him Russia's first Grand Slam champion since Maria Sharapova and the first Russian man to win a Slam since Marat Safin in 2005.



Having already won the Australian Open, French Open and Wimbledon titles this year, 34-year-old Djokovic was chasing a record 21st Grand Slam men's title at the U.S. Open, but at last he was burdened by the weight of history.



""Relief. I was glad it was over,"" a tearful Djokovic said. ""The buildup for this tournament and everything that mentally, emotionally I had to deal with throughout the tournament in the last couple of weeks was just a lot. It was a lot to handle."" ""I was just glad that finally the run is over. At the same time, I felt sadness, disappointment and also gratitude for the crowd and for that special moment that they created for me on the court,"" he added.

Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane scored on each side of a Fabinho goal to help Liverpool to a 3-0 win over Leeds on Sunday at Elland Road.

The result took Liverpool to third place on same points with Manchester United and Chelsea.

The Reds went ahead after 21 minutes after Salah latched on to a Trent Alexander-Arnold pass, the Egyptians second goal in two straight games.

Fabinho doubled his side¡¯s lead early in the second half, firing in a rebound from close-range after a Virgil van Dijk attempt had been blocked.

Things got worse for the hosts on the hour mark as substitute Pascal Struijk saw red for a robust challenge on Harvey Elliott, who was stretched out of the game by medics.

From that moment on, Liverpool pushed to increase their goal tally, but were forced to wait until the 93rd minute when Mane turned in the penalty area and netted from a Thiago Alcantara pass.

The Red¡¯s not turn their focus onto the UEFA Champions League with their season opener against Italian side AC Milan scheduled for Wednesday."

Russell, 87, was inducted into the HOF for the second time as coach after receiving the honor as a player, making him the first person to enter the HOF with such a distinction. Russell became the African American head coach in NBA history and led the Boston Celtics to win the NBA Championship in 1968 as a player-coach and then won it again in 1969. ""This honor would never be possible without my great friend, Red Auerbach. Red was a visionary. When he first asked me if I wanted to coach the Boston Celtics, I wondered, 'Could I coach Bill Russell?' Coaching the Celtics was one of the most challenging and rewarding experiences I had through my 13 years in the NBA. I had (chosen) Hall of Fame presenters who each hold a special place in my life and who I take great pride in playing a role in their lives. We are missing two important presenters: David Stern and Kobe Bryant, whose friendships meant a lot to me. And to my wife, Jeannine, thank you for putting up with me and for your love and support. Thank you,"" said Russell in a recorded statement. He walked onto the stage with the help of Julius Erving in front of his presenters: Charles Barkley, Spencer Haywood, Alonzo Mourning, Bill Walton and Rick Welts.

""Hey, Chris Weber, we're going into the Hall of Fame with Bill Russell, bro. That's crazy,"" said Bosh. Bosh and Webber were 11-time and five-time All-Star power forwards respectively when they were playing. Webber was also a five-time All-NBA Team selection (First Team once, Second Team three times and Third Team once) but Bosh had two rings, which he won with the Miami Heat as one of the Big 3 with LeBron James and Dwyane Wade. Both James and Wade attended the ceremony. Back in 2010 summer, when Pat Riley was trying to recruit Bosh for the Heat, he presented all of the seven rings he had won (before 2010) and gave one of them to Bosh ""on loan."" Riley said he could return it after they won a title together. After that, Bosh won two rings in Miami and he was finally able to give it back to Riley.

One unfortunate part of Bosh's career was that he had to retire at 31 because of blood clots. ""After finally making it to the mountaintop with so much more to do, in my mind, so much more work to do, it all stopped. I eventually came to realize that we all have it in our power to make the most out of every day despite what happens, to turn setbacks into strengths,"" Bosh said in his speech. Bosh also paid respect to Kobe Bryant, recalling his time in Las Vegas with Team USA ahead of the Summer Olympics in Beijing. Bosh wanted to ""establish himself as a young leader of the team"" by ""waking up bright and early."" ""So I set my alarm, I make sure I'm up by sunrise, I get out of my bed, I put on my gear and I head down stairs. But when I get there, Kone is already there, with ice bags on his knees, drenched in sweat. It took me a minute to figure it out but this guy wasn't only awake before me. He had already worked out. He had just played in the Finals days earlier. Meanwhile, I have been off for months but I was still exhausted. What he had done that morning was incomprehensible to me. That dedication he had only days after falling short of an NBA Championship. That taught me something I've never forgotten. Legends aren't defined by their successes, they're defined by how they bounce back from their failures,"" said Bosh.

Pierce was drafted by the Celtics with the 10th overall pick in 1998, and he still gets choked up about that to this day. ""I appreciate that. Thank you for passing on me. It added fuel to my fire. To this day I don't understand how I slipped to No. 10. But you know everything happened for a reason. Going to the Celtics, I'm grateful,"" said Pierce. He also recalled the days working with Coach Doc Rivers, who led him to the only title of his career in 2008. ""We didn't start off on the best foot. I know you wanted to trade me. I was accustomed to doing things my way, I didn't like someone coming and telling me what to do. When I started listening to you, that's when I became great,"" added Pierce. Others gave food for thought in their speeches too.

Editor's note: Daryl Guppy is an international financial technical analysis expert. He has provided weekly Shanghai Index analysis for media for the Chinese mainland for more than a decade. Guppy appears regularly on CNBC Asia and is known as ""The Chart Man."" He is a national board member of the Australia China Business Council. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

The world recoiled in horror when the remains of at least 750 children were unearthed at the site of a former residential school in Saskatchewan, Canada. First Nations people were unsurprised after telling their horrifying stories of child abuse in the ""Mush Hole""at the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. Their treatment is part of a consistent pattern of child abuse applied not just to First Nations people, but as a consequence of the way religion shaped the structure and implementation of these child removal policies.

The Canadian experience is replicated in the United States and Australia. Without doubt the same conditions have applied in other countries colonized by Europeans in Africa and Asia.

Understanding how we got to this situation starts with the concept of those who can be saved and those whose souls are irremediable. These religious influences cannot be separated from the formulation and implementation of secular policy that in turn handed the operation of orphanages and boarding schools to religious orders.

The Catholic orders in Ireland and the way in which a segment of society ¨C unwed mothers ¨C was selected and punished for religious transgressions sets a template for the treatment of First Nations people. This was the punishment of a group rejected by religious society and resulted in 9,000 child deaths in Ireland's church-run homes for unwed mothers.

This same philosophy of the saved and the irredeemable underpinned many of the interactions with indigenous people in Canada, Australia, the United States, Indonesia and elsewhere.

Colonization involved elimination, exploitation and assimilation ¨C what the Canadian Truth and Reconciliation Commission called ""cultural genocide."" First was the physical elimination of any of the adult native population that opposed colonization. This includes the long-running American Indian wars. It defines the Zulu wars and native wars in Africa waged by the Dutch and other European colonizers.

Crushing resistance enabled exploitation. Cultural elimination and assimilation followed, with the intention of converting the indigenous child population into lesser members of the dominant culture. These objectives were always framed as being for their own good and to bring them into a civilized environment. This purpose was often subverted by a overlay that sought not just civilization, but religious conversions. Children who resisted were not worthy of the effort, and by a perverse logic, were able to be treated in a separate world that had few ethics and a lesser standard of morality."

Emma Raducanu completed her historic run through the U.S. Open by beating Leylah Fernandez 6-4, 6-3 for her first Grand Slam title on Saturday. Raducanu was already the first player in the professional era, dating to 1968, to come through the qualifying rounds to reach the final of a major tournament. The 18-year-old from Britain then won it, becoming the youngest Grand Slam champion since 17-year-old Maria Sharapova at Wimbledon of Russia in 2004. In just her second Grand Slam tournament, Raducanu ended the tournament as the first player since American Serena Williams in 2014 to not drop a set in the U.S. Open. She closed out the match after needing a medical timeout during her service game for treatment after cutting her knee.

Canadian Fernandez, aged 19, knocked out three top-five players en route to the final but couldn't find the energy for a comeback after playing four straight three-set matches. ""I knew I would have to dig deep,"" Raducanu said. ""It was an incredibly difficult match but I thought the level was really high. I had to play some of my best tennis."" ""Both of us were playing fearless tennis for two weeks,"" Raducanu said. ""I hope we play each other in many more tournaments and hopefully finals. ""It shows the future of women's tennis and the depth of the game right now is so great.""

Queen Elizabeth II was among the first to pay tribute to Raducanu's win. ""It is a remarkable achievement at such a young age, and is testament to your hard work and dedication,"" the British monarch said in a statement. British tennis legends Virginia Wade and Tim Henman were among a sellout crowd of 23,700 that created an electric atmosphere at Arthur Ashe Stadium in the first-ever women's Slam final between unseeded players. ""It means so much to have Virginia here and also Tim and to have such British legends and icons, to follow in their footsteps and it gave me the belief I could actually do it,"" Raducanu said.

A superstar in the making At Flushing Meadow her poise and nerveless play belied her age as she became the darling of fans and media. As a child though, the drive instilled in her by her Romanian father Ian and Chinese mother Renee, who insisted she try a range of activities including go-karting, ballet and horse riding, made her feel a bit of an outsider. ""When I was younger, I was the only girl in my group karting or doing motocross, and I thought it was pretty cool,"" she explained in Vogue. ""For example, one time, my motocross teacher was like, right, we're going to do press-ups. I was the only one who could do it, so I was proud of myself for that."" It was tennis, though, that her teachers identified from the age of five as the sport in which she would shine. Her primary school teacher Rebecca Rodger said that when the school held tennis coaching, most of the children had difficulty even making contact with the ball. ""But there was Emma having a rally with the coaches. We couldn't quite believe it. Even then I remember thinking that we were going to see her at Wimbledon,"" Rodger told The Times.

Cristiano Ronaldo scored twice against Newcastle United on his return to Manchester United on Saturday as the Red Devils ran out 4-1 winners.

The Portuguese was named in the starting line up by manager Ole Gunnar Solskj?r two weeks after he agreed to a return to his former club from Juventus.

His first goal came on the stroke of half-time, sparking an uproar from Manchester United fans whose excitement has remained on a high since the announcement of the reunion.

Mason Greenwood, who had scored in all previous three games for his side, sent a low shot which Freddie Woodman couldn't hold on to, and Ronaldo was there to tap the rebound in right next to the helpless keeper.

Newcastle pulled one back through Javier Manquillo in the 56th minute, but the score did not remain so for long as Ronaldo latched onto a pass from Luke Shaw to power a shot past Woodman.

Fellow Portuguese star Bruno Fernandes added a sublime third 10 minutes from time, and there was still enough time for substitute Jesse Lingard to add a fourth for the side.

The win took Manchester United on top of the Premier League standings provisionally, ahead of Chelsea's clash with Aston Villa later on Saturday, with Liverpool and Everton also yet to play."

Torch for Hangzhou 2022 Asian Games unveiled,"Hangzhou 2022 organizers unveiled the torch for the event, titled ""Eternal Flame,"" on Saturday, which marks the one-year countdown to the opening ceremony.

Inspired by the Liangzhu Culture, the torch symbolizes the inheritance of Chinese culture through generations spanning 5,000 years.

Its base is embossed with eight water veins symbolizing the evolution of civilization and representing the eight major river systems in Zhejiang Province. The top is characterized by the meaning of Jade Cong to show harmonious square-round integration. And the burner nozzle is designed from the earliest oracle bone inscription of Jade Cong with the implied meaning of ""light traveling in cycle inside.""

The design intended to highlight the uninterrupted continuity of Chinese civilization.

The raw materials of the torch were digitally mapped to the blockchain and the traceability mechanism is used to ensure authenticity. The grip is made of recycled, eco-friendly raw materials and the fuel is biomass gas, which is clean, safe and reliable.

Football legend Edson Arantes do Nascimento, better known as Pele, remained in intensive care on Friday as the Brazilian star recovered from surgery to remove a tumor on the right side of his colon.

Hospital Albert Einstein in Sao Paulo said in a statement that the 80-year-old was recovering ""in a satisfactory manner,"" though still in intensive care. The hospital had said on September 6 that Pele was expected to be moved to a regular ward on September 7.

The hospital also said Pele is ""awake, actively talking and keeping his vital signs in normality.""

The three-time World Cup winner also said on his Instagram that ""each day I feel a little better.""

He went to the hospital for routine exams at the end of August when the tumor was found. The hospital said in a statement then that the tumor was identified during routine cardiovascular and laboratory exams. It added it collected samples to be analyzed but has not released the results.

Pele, the only male footballer to win three World Cups, has had mobility problems since a failed hip replacement surgery in 2012. He has been forced to use walkers and wheelchairs in public. He has also been admitted to several hospitals in recent years for kidney and prostate procedures.

Winning the 1958, 1962 and 1970 World Cups, Pele remains Brazil's all-time leading scorer with 77 goals in 92 matches.

Pele's international record was overtaken by Lionel Messi of Argentina on Thursday, as Messi scored a hat-trick to become the top international goalscorer in South American football history.

Chinese company releases new bobsled for Winter Games,"China has unveiled a domestically designed bobsled ahead of the Beijing Winter Olympics.

The sleds, in two and four seats, have been developed with the input of more than a dozen Chinese companies in less than 200 days, including firms involved in the automotive and aerospace industries.

""China Aerospace was mainly involved in the design of the sleds' surface material and aerodynamic configuration. We performed comprehensive analysis and design based on the needs of athletes,"" said Yang Wenli, a project management director at China FAW Group Corporation, a leading automotive company in the country.

The sleds have gone through the most intricate aerodynamic tests with at least 10 major parts optimized during the R&D period.

""The task is a new challenge for us as the time is limited and there are many difficulties to solve,"" said Jia Yi, a senior expert on low-speed wind tunnel at China Academy of Aerospace Aerodynamics.

""All the materials that we use for the sleds are made in China, like the T800 level carbon fiber composite which is even advanced in aerospace,¡±said Zhou Yu, a material specialist from China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology.

Designers say the sleds' speed can exceed 160 kilometers per hour, making it among the fastest in the world.

""We have a very big advantage compared with the similar products from other countries. We could quickly upgrade products based on self-designed technologies and adapt to the needs of athletes,"" said Cao Lijun, vice dean of Innovation Technology Research Institute at FAW.

The Japan Football Association (JFA) has withdrawn from hosting the 2021 Club World Cup originally scheduled to happen in December due to the COVID-19 situation in the country, world football's governing body (FIFA) said on Thursday.

A new version of the event which would include 24 teams was originally planned to debut in China in June 2021, but FIFA announced in December 2020 to cancel the launch of the new edition, and that the old version which typically included 7 teams would continue and be staged in Japan.

""FIFA can confirm that it has been informed today by the JFA that, due to the COVID-19 pandemic and hosting situation in the country, they are no longer in a position to host the FIFA Club World Cup 2021,"" it said in a statement.

""FIFA would like to thank the JFA for their work and commitment and looks forward to going back to Japan in the future. Further details about an alternative host for the FIFA Club World Cup 2021 will be announced by FIFA in due course.""

The Japanese government on Thursday decided to extend the COVID-19 state of emergency in many parts of the country as it looked to suppress a fresh wave of infections.

With the JFA relinquishing its right to host this event, Qatar is potentially taking over the job, according to The Telepraph.

Lionel Messi scored a hat-trick to overtake Pele as the top international goalscorer in South American football history on Thursday, as Argentina cruised to a 3-0 victory over Bolivia in their 2022 World Cup qualifier.

Messi pounced for his 77th, 78th and 79th international goals to keep Argentina firmly on course for a place at next year's finals in Qatar against a Bolivia team languishing near the foot of the table.

The 34-year-old Paris Saint-Germain forward, making his 153rd appearance for Argentina, drew level with Pele's longstanding mark of 77 goals in the 14th minute, nutmegging a defender and then curling a sublime shot past Bolivia goalkeeper Carlos Lampe.

The Argentina captain then moved one clear of Pele in the 64th minute with his second goal of the night, surging into the Bolivian box and playing a one-two with Lautaro Martinez before tucking away a finish from close range.

Messi completed the seventh international hat-trick of his career two minutes from time, burying a rebound from close range after a shot from the edge of the area was only parried by Lampe.

""Overall, I think I have got a very positive response,"" declared Arsene Wenger, FIFA's head of Global Football Development, when asked at a recent press briefing about the organization's extremely radical and highly controversial plans to stage the World Cup every two years.



The former Arsenal legend, one of the most successful managers in the history of the Premier League, is widely considered to have been the embodiment of wisdom and reason during his trophy-laden coaching career.



However, as the current public face of this biennial World Cup idea, the 71-year-old Frenchman has underestimated the loud and powerful opposition to change the status quo.

Arsene Wenger has led the project to stage the World Cup every two years despite European opposition. /CFP Arsene Wenger has led the project to stage the World Cup every two years despite European opposition. /CFP

The first shot was fired by UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin, who expressed straight from the shoulder his objection to the plan and even looked at the possibility of boycotting the showpiece event. ""We can decide not to play in it. As far as I know, the South Americans are on the same page. So good luck with a World Cup like that,"" Ceferin told The Times.



""I think it will never happen as it is so much against the basic principles of football. To play every summer a one-month tournament, for the players it's a killer. It might be good for UEFA financially but the problem is we would be killing football like that. We are killing the players. I don't see the clubs allowing the players to go and that would divide us completely,"" he added.



La Liga president Javier Tebas also voiced his opposition. ""A biennial World Cup is a threat not just to domestic football leagues but to the overall tradition of world football,"" he told Marca.



""It would require a reshuffle of the calendar that would disrupt the domestic leagues to the extent that interest would be lost and the continuity is jeopardized. This would have a cascading effect on the entire football pyramid, with fans losing interest in the sport. New competitions or playing more often will not help grow football, to the contrary.""

""There may be vested interests here, but the summer sports are protective about the landscape as it's hard enough for them as it is to grab space in the traditional or digital media.

""I'm a big football fan, but I fear that you're going to put a lot of players under some big physical stress. The clubs and leagues are all opposed to it. And my gut instinct is that you can keep cramming stuff into the calendar if you really want to, but less is more sometimes,"" Coe concluded.

Prosecutor Stefanie Eckert told the court that Boateng's former partner Sherin Senler was a ""victim of domestic violence"" but also that Boateng was a ""victim of their mutually toxic relationship.""

The public prosecutor had been looking for a suspended jail sentence of one and a half years and a fine of 1.5 million euros.

It was the highest possible financial damages that could be imposed by the Munich District Court.

Former Germany and Bayern Munich footballer Jerome Boateng was found guilty of domestic violence against his former partner and ordered to pay her 1.8 million euros ($2.13 million) on Thursday.

The 33-year-old Boateng, who had denied the allegations of abuse, reacted calmly to the court's decision. He can appeal the ruling.

Boateng had earlier denied hitting and injuring Senler in July 2018 when they were on vacation in the Turks and Caicos Islands. He was charged with allegations of willful bodily harm and verbal abuse against Senler, the mother of their two children.

The indictment said Boateng beat her, boxed her, bit her head, threw her on the ground and insulted her. The prosecutors' office also accused Boateng of throwing a glass lantern and cooling bag at his partner.

Boateng told the court his former partner had become aggressive and insulting during a dispute after a game of cards. He said she hit him and injured his lip and that she fell when he tried to push her away. He disputed throwing a lantern at her, but said it fell when he threw a cushion at a table. Boateng said he had never hit his ex-girlfriend.

Senler later told the court that Boateng punched her in the kidney so hard that she found it difficult to breathe. She said he tore at her hair, bit her head, and pressed his thumb into her eye, giving her a black eye. She said that particular incident on July 19, 2018, was not the first of its kind, but the most violent.

She said the couple had an ""on-off relationship"" since 2007. ""Our relationship was always turbulent,"" Senler said."

""The French League did not, like your league, wait until recent years to take actions and put in place strong financial regulations. It is now publicly known that certain Spanish clubs and your league are facing unsustainable levels of debt after gross mismanagement, not to mention the way Spanish football has been financed over the past decade ¨C including by the state,"" added Melero."

Nice finally learned their fate on Wednesday night. The French Ligue 1 club, who were at the center of ugly crowd trouble that led to their home match against Marseille on August 22 being abandoned, have been docked two points by the League's disciplinary commission.



The topflight game between the two sides was suspended when Nice fans invaded the pitch and clashed with players and members of the coaching staff. The invasion at the Allianz Riviera Stadium was sparked when Marseille star Dimitri Payet, who was hit on the back of the head by a bottle launched from the stands, threw a bottle back into the crowd.



""After reading the investigation report in the presence of the two clubs, the Commission decided to replay the match on a relocated field. In addition, two penalty points were imposed on Nice, including one suspended point,"" the Ligue de Football Professionnel (LFP) said in a statement.



The LFP also announced that Nice's next three home games will all be played behind closed doors. As for the players involved in the violence, Payet has been slapped with a suspended one-match ban. His teammate Alvaro Gonzalez, who was also accused of provoking Nice fans, has been handed a two-game suspension.

Marseille physio Pablo Fernandez, who was filmed punching a Nice supporter, has been given a nine-month touchline ban, which means he will miss all Ligue 1 activities for the rest of the season.



Meanwhile, Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) have hit back at Spanish La Liga chief Javier Tebas in the row over his extraordinary and ringing denunciation of the French Ligue 1 giants and their players.



Tebas earlier told a news conference that PSG, who scooped 34-year-old Lionel Messi from Barcelona this summer, were ""as dangerous"" as the doomed European Super League. ""PSG look like the league of legends given the age of some players. La Liga has young players like Vinicius [Junior]. What PSG are doing is as dangerous as the Super League,"" Tebas said.



""We will continue to grow despite the departure of Messi. We will work against the club states. These clubs are as much enemies as the Super League,"" added Tebas, who is a staunch critic of PSG's financial might in the transfer window.

In a robust response, PSG said La Liga clubs were on the receiving end of state subsidies and Tebas should mind his own business rather than attack PSG.



""Time after time, you allow yourself to publicly attack the French League, our clubs, our players while constantly posting insulting and defamatory statements insinuating that we do not conform to the football financial regulations,"" PSG general secretary Victoriano Melero said in a statement.



""It will not have escaped your attention that we comply with UEFA and French regulations. It is worth noting that the French League did not, like your league, wait until recent years to put in place strong financial regulations.



""It is now publicly known that certain Spanish clubs and your league are facing unsustainable levels of debt after gross mismanagement, not to mention the way Spanish football has been financed over the past decade ¨C including by the state.

Moise Kean grabbed his first international goals since March 2019 as Italy thrashed Lithuania 5-0 in World Cup qualifiers on Wednesday, as Damian Szymanski's late header forced England to settle for a draw in Poland.

Italy had drawn their previous two qualifiers to slip into a battle with Switzerland for automatic qualification from Group C. But the European champions, who set a new world record of 36 internationals unbeaten with the goalless draw against the Swiss at the weekend, produced a dominant display against Lithuania in Reggio Emilia.

Young striker Kean, who rejoined Juventus from Everton in the close-season after a successful loan spell at Paris Saint-Germain, scored twice in the first half.

Edgaras Utkus put through his own net and Giacomo Raspadori also scored as Italy moved four ahead at the break.

Giovanni Di Lorenzo made it five in the second period as Roberto Mancini's side stretched their lead over Switzerland at the top of the table to six points.

The Azzurri are hoping to banish the memories of their shock failure to qualify for the 2018 World Cup in Russia.

The Swiss do have two games in hand, but they were held to a 0-0 draw by Northern Ireland in Belfast, with Haris Seferovic having a penalty saved by Bailey Peacock-Farrell."

What awaits Luka Doncic and Dallas Mavericks in new NBA season?,"Luka Doncic (R) of the Dallas Mavericks and the team's owner Mark Cuban attend the press conference on Doncic signing contract extension with the Mavericks in Ljubljana, Slovenia, August 10, 2021. /CFP Luka Doncic (R) of the Dallas Mavericks and the team's owner Mark Cuban attend the press conference on Doncic signing contract extension with the Mavericks in Ljubljana, Slovenia, August 10, 2021. /CFP

The Dallas Mavericks and their owner Mark Cuban were sincere enough flying to Slovenia to offer a five-year, $207-million contract extension to Luka Doncic. The 22-year-old genius signed on it, making sure that the Mavericks can retain him until 2027 summer. Having played three seasons in the NBA, Doncic averaged 25.7 points, 7.3 rebounds and 8.4 assists. His 3-point rate last season rose to 35 percent at which he could drain 2.9 triples per game. He has been considered for the regular season MVP for quite a while. Having led the Mavericks to the playoffs in the past two seasons, Doncic was even more dominant in the postseason as he dropped 35.7 points, 7.9 rebounds and 10.3 assists while making 4.4 shots from the 3-point line at 40.8 percent. Doncic had his playoff highlights as well after beating the buzzer against the Los Angeles Clippers. He is already a top playmaker in today's NBA.

However, the Mavericks have yet found proper help for Doncic. During this year's offseason, they extended Tim Hardaway Jr.'s deal by five years, $90 million; they signed free agents Reggie Bullock and Sterling Brown. They surely wanted to do more and tried to chase Chris Paul, Kyle Lowry, Mike Conley or Spencer Dinwiddie, only to find that none of them wanted to come to American Airlines Center. That means the Mavericks will start the new season with basically the same squad from last year. Unfortunately, that roster is not good enough to make any difference in the Western Conference with the following problems. Lack of the second playmaker Basketball grows more ""positionless"" in today's NBA and Doncic has been doing an orchestrator's job most of the time. But the Mavericks still need the second player able to launch offense either from outside via screen play or from inside by posting up around the paint. Jalen Brunson is a good player and works really hard, but he is not the material to make a starting point guard in a playoff team. Kristaps Porzingis was such a big disappointment in the series against the Clippers that he almost became toxic asset with his contract that has three years, $100 million left (player option in 2023).

Lack of a well-balanced final squad From the Golden State Warriors' ""Hampton Five"" in 2017 to the Clippers' death lineup last season, every NBA team that targets the throne must have their ultimate squad for the clutch time of the game. Two things are necessary for such squads: First, players must be able to defend multiple positions; second, they have to be able to stretch the floor. The Mavericks, unfortunately, don¡¯t have any solution like this. Two years ago, they filled the roster with shooters but were too vulnerable defensively. One year ago, the team tried to pivot to toward defense by landing Josh Richardson and James Johnson but it did not work as they had expected.

Kyodo News: Japan won't host 2021 Club World Cup due to COVID-19,"The Emperor's Cup final may be brought forward from New Year's Day to December 19 since the Club World Cup won't happen around that date, according to Kyodo News. That should give the Japanese national team players more time to rest and prepare for the FIFA World Cup qualification tournament games on January 27 and February 1, 2022.

Kyodo News also revealed that FIFA has not decided which country will replace Japan as the host or when the tournament will happen. Traditionally, the Club World Cup takes place in December, but it might be postponed this time.

The Japan Football Association (JFA) is discussing relinquishing the right to host the 2021 Club World Cup with FIFA due to the COVID-19 situation in the country, according to Kyodo News.

The Club World Cup, which evolved from the Toyota Cup, used to combine both the European and South American champions in one game. Today, the event has clubs from six confederations. The JFA was counting on it to create decent revenues with full crowds of over 60,000 for the semifinals and final at International Stadium Yokohama.

However, that plan is not going anywhere because of the COVID-19 restrictions in place. Even if the games can happen ¨C probably behind closed doors ¨C there will be hardly any profit, if not losses.

The JFA's profit for the 2020 fiscal year was 15 billion yen (about $136 million), five billion yen less than in 2019. National team games had no spectators at all. As a result, Kozo Tashima, president of the Japanese football-governing body, said the JFA has to ""dip into their savings"" this fiscal year.

""Unless we forge a path to where events can be staged in coexistence with the virus, soccer as well as other sports won't be able to maintain themselves,"" said a senior JFA official."

The NBL is the top basketball league in Australia. LaMelo Ball played for the Illawarra Hawks in the 2019-20 season and was named the NBL Rookie of the Year before getting drafted by the NBA's Charlotte Hornets with the third-overall pick in 2020.

Another promising young man who left the NBL for the NBA in recent years was Josh Giddey who played for the Adelaide 36ers and won the Rookie of the Year Award as well before being selected by the Oklahoma City Thunder with the sixth-overall pick on July 29.

Yuya Osako's first-half goal helped Japan beat China 1-0 in the final round of the FIFA World Cup Asian Zone qualifiers on Tuesday.

China came into the game after a 3-0 defeat to Australia, while Japan were stunned by Oman 1-0 in their opener of the final qualifying round. Both teams were eager to get their qualification campaign back on track.

Facing Japan, the highest FIFA ranked team in Asia, Chinese head coach Li Tie fielded five defenders in the starting line-up. But they suffered an early setback as veteran center back Zhang Linpeng had to be stretched off just five minutes into the match due to a waist injury and was replaced by Zhu Chenjie.

""Zhang was injured by accident. His injury seems very severe and he will go through PCR test tomorrow,"" Li said in the post-match press conference. ""We had a preliminary plan when Zhang couldn't play, the young defender Zhu played a very good match and executed our tactics well.""

Japan had 78 percent ball possession and 14 shots in the first half. Forward Kubo Takefusa penetrated into the penalty area in the 22nd minute, but his close-range shot was denied by the post. They broke the deadlock in the 40th minute, when Junya Ito raced down the right flank and found Osako who tapped in from inside the box to put his side 1-0 ahead.

In the second half, China managed to keep Japan at bay but was unable to level the score despite sending strikers A Lan and Luo Guofu on in a bid to strengthen their counterattack.

""I am very grateful for the efforts of my players. We saw the gap between us and the best team in Asia through the game. I am satisfied with the fighting spirits of my players,"" Li said. ""All my players have equal opportunities, I only select the starting lineup on the basis of the game plan and requirements. No matter starters or substitutes, they all fought hard.""

The Chinese were drawn into Group B of the final round with Australia, Japan, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Vietnam. The top two will qualify for Qatar 2022 directly. The third finisher will play a home-and-away playoff with its counterpart in Group A, and the winner will go into a continental playoff.

Elsewhere on Tuesday, Australia beat Vietnam 1-0 to top the group, while Saudi Arabia also claimed a 1-0 victory against Oman.

China will next play Vietnam on October 7 in Sharjah, the United Arab Emirates. The Chinese sqaud will depart for Sharjah on Wednesday.

""We will definitely train very hard and I hope all my players' fitness could improve to a higher level after one month of training,"" Li said.

""I hope we have chances to play friendly matches against teams who are better than us. Before the final round of the qualifying tournament, We couldn't play high-quality games for nearly two years due to the pandemic. Australia and Japan out-competed us with a fast tempo, that's what we need to improve on,"" he added."

Canadian Leylah Fernandez was unstoppable at the U.S. Open, with a roaring 6-3, 3-6, 7-6(5) win over Ukrainian No. 5 seed Elina Svitolina in a women's singles quarterfinal on Tuesday.

Fernandez, who just turned 19 on Monday, has defeated top-ranked players and made the crowds go wild at Flushing Meadows, starting from her battle against four-time major champion Naomi Osaka, followed by her victory over former world number one Angelique Kerber.

Fernandez had Svitolina off-balance from the start, denying the 26-year-old a single break opportunity as she bagged the opening set.

Playing with more aggression, Svitolina broke Fernandez twice in the second set to build a 5-1 advantage.

Fernandez, however, wasn't going to give in an inch in the third set tiebreak, and awarded herself with a birthday present of a spot in the last four.

Fernandez as well as Emma Raducanu and Carlos Alcaraz have shown themselves as sensational teenagers who cannot be ignored anymore.

Alcaraz became the youngest male quarterfinalist at the U.S. Open after he defeated third seed Stefanos Tsitsipas and Peter Gojowczyk, but had to retire at that stage against Felix Auger-Aliassime who was leading 6-2, 3-1.

Raducanu will be fighting for a spot in the semifinals against top-ranked Belinda Bencic.

Also on Tuesday, men's second seed Daniil Medvedev advanced to the semifinals after defeating Botic van de Zandschulp 6-3, 6-0, 4-6, 7-5. He next plays Auger-Aliassime."

The name of Zheng Tao got etched in the world's memory after the Chinese swimmer broke three world records and won four gold medals at the Tokyo Paralympics.

Zhang was always there holding the sheet that Zheng held in his mouth before propelling himself in the pool. That job is actually more difficult than it appears. ""If you hold it too low, he can't jump high enough; if you hold it too high, he can't pull full strength,"" 61-year-old Zhang told Beijing Youth Daily.

When asked why it must be him to hold the sheet for Zheng, Zhang did not tell a story of how the two went through so much together or anything like that. Instead, he simply said: ""Maybe I always bring him good luck."" However, Zhang did not hold himself back in praising Zheng: ""Team China needs a victory to start the swimming competitions at the Paralympics and it's all on Zheng Tao to do that. He never let us down in the three Paralympics before. ¡­ He always keeps a low-profile attitude. If he was more talkative, he would have been much more famous."" China sent 32 swimmers to the Tokyo Paralympics, only half of the number for Rio 2016, but that did not keep them from dominating the events. Team China claimed 19 gold, 19 silver and 18 bronze medals. Zhang has attended eight editions of the Paralympic Games from 1992 to 2021, witnessing every stage and cornerstone of the development of Chinese Paralympic swimming. He became a coach for Paralympians in 1988 after realizing how much swimming could help the physically challenged.

""We had to do everything under limited conditions at the beginning. Back then, Paralympians were considered as amateur athletes and did not receive enough attention. We only had a loose organization and not any systematic mechanism,"" Zhang told Beijing Youth Daily. Paralympic swimming went though dramatic changes in the following decades. Zhang believes the biggest difference is that more schools offering special education to people with disabilities were opened, thereby helping the team find talents more efficiently as well as helping the physically challenged realize that they have more options than just becoming an athlete. However, according to Zhang, many today still chose to become athletes because they want to surpass their physical limits ¨C they have a simpler but purer goal.

ANVISA said Brazilian rules make clear that travelers who have been in the UK, South Africa or India during the previous 14 days are forbidden from entering the country unless they are Brazilian citizens or have permanent residency.

""Valtteri has done a fantastic job over the past five seasons and he has made an essential contribution to our success and to our growth. ""Together with Lewis, he has built a benchmark partnership between two teammates in the sport, and that has been a valuable weapon in our championship battles and pushed us to achieve unprecedented success."" Wolff said Bottas, a calm and straightforward personality who gets on well with Hamilton, would have deserved to stay with Mercedes. ""When the time comes, he will leave us with huge goodwill from every single member of the team, and he will forever be part of the Mercedes family,"" said the Austrian.

Brazil's World Cup South American qualifying clash against Argentina was dramatically suspended shortly after kick-off on Sunday as controversy over COVID-19 protocols erupted.

Amid incredible scenes at Sao Paulo's Neo Quimica Arena, the match between the two giants of South American football came to a halt when a group of Brazilian public health officials came onto the pitch, triggering a melee involving team staff and players.

Argentina's players trudged off the pitch to the changing room as the fury erupted. Argentina captain Lionel Messi later re-emerged from the tunnel without his team shirt on as confusion swept around the stadium.

The South American Football Confederation (CONMEBOL) said in a statement that the game had been ""suspended"" but did not say whether the match would resume or be replayed.

""By decision of the match referee, the match organized by FIFA between Brazil and Argentina for the qualifiers for the World Cup is suspended,"" the statement said.

""The referee and the match commissioner will submit a report to the FIFA Disciplinary Committee, which will determine the steps to follow. These procedures adhere strictly to current regulations.""

The stunning intervention came just hours after Brazil's health authorities said four players in Argentina's squad based in England should be placed in ""immediate quarantine"" for breaching COVID-19 protocols.

According to Brazil's National Health Surveillance Agency (ANVISA), Premier League players Giovani Lo Celso, Emiliano Martinez, Emiliano Buendia and Cristian Romero provided ""false information"" upon their entry to Brazil.

Romero, Lo Celso and Martinez were all in the Argentina starting lineup that kicked off Sunday's game ¨C triggering the intervention onto the field of officials wearing ANVISA shirts."

The Brooklyn Nets continue to build their small-ball squad for the 2021-22 NBA season by acquiring Paul Millsap, trading DeAndre Jordan for Sekou Doumbouya and signing LaMarcus Aldridge again. Millsap, 36, has agreed to a one-year deal with the Nets, according to Shams Charania of The Athletic who spoke to Millsap's agent DeAngelo Simmons. The Nets let Jeff Green go during the offseason partly for financial reasons. Green joined the Denver Nuggets on a two-year, $10-million contract ¨C a number that will lead to a drastic rise in the luxury tax paid by the team.

Compared with Green, Millsap has less to contribute in off-ball offense and pick-and-rill play, but he is a stronger defender and a better rebounder. He will be a decent substitution for Blake Griffin in the team's small-ball roster. Millsap may not be fast enough to defend perimeter players in mismatch but he can still take on giant power forwards or small-ball centers, namely Giannis Antetokounmpo. Having played 15 seasons in the NBA, Millsap is in the best place to chase his first ring of the career. Few saw it coming when Aldridge decided to retire from the NBA due to irregular heartbeat in April. Fewer expected him to return and reach a one-year, $2.6-million deal with the Nets ¨C of course, after he was cleared by doctors, according to ESPN which talked to his agent Jeff Schwartz of Excel Sports.

""I retired in April based on what I believed was the wisest precautionary decision for my personal health at the time, but further testing and evaluation by several top physicians has convinced the doctors, myself and the Nets that I'm fully cleared and able to return to the rigors of the NBA. I loved my brief time with Brooklyn and am excited to rejoin the team in pursuit of a championship,"" said Aldridge in a statement to ESPN. Though Aldridge spent most of his career in the power forward position, he appeared more often in center at the final phase of his career. With his 2.11-meter height and 113-kg weight, Aldridge is fully capable of playing center in today's league. In the series against the Milwaukee Bucks last season, the Nets had to watch Antetokounmpo wreak havoc on their rim the moment Griffin returned to the bench. Green was not the answer for him and coach Steve Nash's belief in small-ball theory led to his decision of abandoning Jordan.

Two-time champion Naomi Osaka suffered a stunning defeat in the third round of the U.S. Open on Friday to Canadian Leylah Fernandez 5-7, 7-6(2), 6-4, ending her title defence inside Arthur Ashe Stadium. After both players held their serves through the first 10 games, the four-time Grand Slam winner broke Fernandez's serve and then closed out the set in the next game with an ace to cheers from the New York crowd. But the night quickly turned sour for the third seed as she dropped her serve to send the second set into the tiebreak, where she uncharacteristically lost her cool, whacking her racquet and then flinging it onto the court twice in frustration as Fernandez scored five straight points.

Earlier on Friday on the men's side, Russian Daniil Medvedev ripped through third-round opponent Pablo Andujar 6-0, 6-4, 6-3, his third win in under two hours at this year's U.S. Open. The world number two held the unseeded Spaniard to five points in the first set, putting up just three unforced errors in a stretch of superb play in his bid for a maiden major title two years after he lost in the final to Rafa Nadal. The Russian has yet to drop a set at Flushing Meadows this year and showed scarce few moments of vulnerability on Friday. He recovered from a double fault in the 10th game of the second set with a pair of aces and fired off 34 winners to Andujar's 16 across the entire match. Andujar converted one of four break point opportunities late in the third set to wild applause from the fans inside Louis Armstrong Stadium. However, it was two little too late as the Australian Open finalist fired back with a break of his own to clinch the match. ""The main positive is to win in three sets because Pablo was fighting good,"" said Medvedev, who clinched his fourth Masters 1000 title last month in Toronto. ""I was playing good and (I'm) really happy with my level."" He faces a potential challenge in the fourth round from 24th-seeded Briton Dan Evans, who beat world number one Novak Djokovic in Monte Carlo in April and whom Medvedev described as ""very smart"". ""He doesn't have one shot that is a weapon, and yet he's a top player for many years already,"" Medvedev told reporters. ""The way he chooses the right moment to go to the net, to slice, to make a dropshot. I mean, his serve is not huge, but it's tough to return. Great player.""

Fueled by the deep pockets, skating venues are popping up in record time, and the number of ski resorts is estimated to jump from about 570 in 2015 to more than 1,000 by 2022, according to an action plan. The number of Chinese companies involved in winter sports also swelled to 4,650 in 2020 from 1,950 in 2015. Even the fiercest skeptic would grudgingly admit that the sector's economic trends are heartening. It was not always obvious that the country would do so well. Only two decades ago, China was practically cut off from the clannish winter sports world by its predominantly unsuitable weather and a lack of popular interest. It had just a dozen indoor ice rinks at the turn of the century. Now, driven by its successful bid for the 2022 Winter Olympics, and its ever-growing prowess in producing artificial snow and ski simulators, China is standing proud as one of the most promising powers in winter sports. For all the phenomenal progress and awe-inspiring breakthroughs, the picture is not all rosy. While the ice and snow industry is firmly gathering pace, China still faces deep-seated structural problems that cannot be remedied merely by government subsidies.

The most glaring of issues at the moment is the country's overwhelming number of beginners in winter sports. Compared to developed countries in the ice and snow industry, this particular group make up a disproportionately large part of the people who participate in winter sports in China. The tricky part is that the percentage of those who bother to convert themselves from thrill-seeking tyros to true-hearted enthusiasts is extremely low, which could bode ill for the sustained and long-term development of China's winter sports industry. There have been mounting concerns about this hidden threat lurking in the shadows, with experts sounding the alarm over the risk of bubbles bursting in the Chinese winter sports market if the status quo is maintained. Hence the importance of the WWSE 2021 cannot be downplayed. The prestigious Expo brings together established brands, emerging start-ups, seasoned retailers and suppliers, and picks the brains of industry heavyweights, government officials and many other distinguished professionals. This grand assembly of the winter sports industry could provide much-needed inspiration and ideas for China to respond to the challenges it is currently encountering.

Novak Djokovic's bid for a 21st major title that would complete a calendar-year Grand Slam picked up pace on Thursday, as the world No. 1 cruised into the U.S. Open third round with a 6-2, 6-3, 6-2 thrashing of Tallon Griekspoor.

Having shaken off the rust in a spotty four-set opening match against 18-year-old Holger Rune on Tuesday, Djokovic was sharper and much more focused against the 25-year-old Dutchman.

Djokovic, playing his first event since the Tokyo Olympics, found the intensity that had been lacking against Rune, speeding through the opening set in 30 minutes.

The highlight of the evening for Griekspoor came in the second set when he broke Djokovic but the Serb would break right back and then hold serve to take the set and a 2-0 lead.

Griekspoor had rallied from 2-1 down in his opening match to collect his first ever Grand Slam win but there was no coming back against the top seed.

Djokovic then broke Griekspoor twice in the third set before sealing the contest with his 13th ace.

Djokovic next faces Japan's Kei Nishikori, the 2014 U.S. Open runner-up."

CGTN Sports Talk: How will 'old' Lakers perform in new NBA season?,"Signing Rajon Rondo to a one-year minimum deal both added to the Los Angeles Lakers' treasure trove of experience and made the team even older. By now, half of the league's oldest guys are with the purple and gold, including their commander LeBron James, who will turn 37 in less than four months.

Such an old roster means the Lakers will be more experienced and probably play smarter on the court, but they are likely to be slower and more vulnerable to injuries as well. Having given up almost all future assets in the past three years, the team must win now. The question is, can those old legs still carry them victory?"

""Even though the season is still on, I want to thank my family, all my teams, everyone involved in my racing career and especially all of you great fans that have been rooting for me all this time.""

However, the Grizzlies were also the last team you wanted to meet in the playoffs from 2011 to 2017, during which they reached the postseason for seven straight seasons. Allen, Randolph, Conley and Marc Gasol were all with that team, playing different but integral roles. Allen, a six-time All-Defensive Team member, was always tasked with covering the opponents' perimeter ace and make them work hard to get anything.

""Finally the mission is accomplished. First stop, Suzhou. I'm going to sweep the tomb of my late mother, who passed away due to health issues last year.""

Lang Ping posted her farewell letter on Chinese social media on Wednesday, announcing her retirement from the position of head coach of the Chinese women's volleyball team.

The volleyball legend, dubbed ""Iron Hammer"" from her days as an athlete, witnessed the Chinese team pocketing all five major titles from 1981 to 1986, including the World Championships, the World Cup, and the Olympic Games, and her successors topping the world ranking in 2018, following their crowning moment in the 2016 Rio Olympics. She is widely recognized as a legend in the sport, as she was at the center of all these glorious times, as a super spiker, then head coach.

The past year has posted challenge on Lang and her girls, adjusting themselves for the delay of the Tokyo Olympics caused by the novel coronavirus, whilst Lang herself suffered the loss of her mother a year back, according to the letter.

""My love for the sport compensates the tiredness from this bumpy road. Everything was to gain, and nothing to lose, despite all the defeats, victories, (and) ups and downs that were inevitable when one chooses such a career. As I look back on my life in volleyball, I feel content and joyous, and cherish what I have had."""

Novak Djokovic took a first unsteady step toward completing the calendar-year Grand Slam on Tuesday as he knocked into the second round of the U.S. Open with a 6-1 6-7(5) 6-2 6-1 win over dashing Danish teenager Holger Rune.

On paper, the contest was a total mismatch ¨C an 18-year-old qualifier making his Grand Slam debut against a player chasing a 21st major title.

While the outcome was exactly what was expected, the effort needed by Djokovic to see off the fearless Dane, who battled to the end despite suffering cramp, was not.

""I started great. Played a really, really good first set,"" said Djokovic. ""After that, I don't know, I was 4-3 serving in the second set, everything was working well, but then I just lost the first serve.

""I had until tonight tons of experience playing on this court, for him it was the first one.

""Still you get nerves. You still are feeling a little bit rusty at the beginning.""

The match got underway amid a somewhat flat atmosphere inside Arthur Ashe Stadium but the crowd were chanting the little-known Dane's name after he stunned Djokovic to win the second set.

Aside from that, it was a controlled effort from the 34-year-old Djokovic, far different from the Serb's last match on this court that ended with him being disqualified after swatting a ball in frustration that struck a line judge in 2020."

Chinese researchers have joined forces to prepare venues, gear and athletes' training facilities for the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics.

In 2018, researchers and students from the wind tunnel lab at Beijing Jiaotong University joined the construction efforts of the Winter Olympic venues.

The National Alpine Ski Center, one of Beijing 2022's most technically challenging venues, was built more than 1,200 meters above sea level on Xiaohaituo Mountain in the Yanqing competition zone.

At the foot of the Alpine ski center, a sliding track for bobsleigh, luge and skeleton at the 2022 Games winds down the mountain, ready for the world's best pilots to display their courage and skills in disciplines often dubbed ""Formula 1 on ice.""

The 1.9-km sliding center, the first of its kind in China, features 16 angled curves to resemble a mythical Chinese dragon.

""The Yanqing competition zone has complex terrain and strong wind,"" said Li Bo, a professor at Beijing Jiaotong University. ""Wind resistance is key to the construction of buildings and temporary facilities.""

Li and his team from the wind tunnel lab studied the wind field data in the Yanqing competition zone and used tunnel tests to assist in the design of the Olympic venues.

According to Qiu Jianbing, the design leader of the sliding center, the facility at the Yanqing competition zone is located on the mountain's southern slope. The design team developed a system combining the terrain, awning and sunshade to reduce the impact of solar radiation.

They analyzed the sun's height in spring, autumn and winter, and used computer models to simulate and determine the awning and sunshade coverage on the track. Now, harsh sunlight will not be an issue for athletes' training and competition."

Two-time Grand Slam champion Simona Halep, battling back from injury, advanced to the second round of the U.S. Open on Monday as the hardcourts showdown began before full-capacity crowds. The 29-year-old Romanian 12th seed defeated Italy's Camila Giorgi 6-4, 7-6 (7/3) to book a second-round match against Slovakian Kristina Kucova, who ousted American Ann Li 7-5, 6-1. Halep, the 2018 French Open and 2019 Wimbledon champion, tore a left calf muscle at the Italian Open, missed the French Open and Wimbledon, then suffered a right thigh injury at Cincinnati, but made a solid New York start. 2017 champion Sloane Stephens edged Madison Keys 6-3, 1-6, 7-6 (7) in a rematch of their final four years ago.

Anderson rattled off 17 aces in the final set alone, the last one coming on match point. Then he broke into wide grin in his moment of triumph before hoisting his arms aloft. While his ace tally was well short of John Isner's record of 113, which he achieved during his 11-hour five-minute first-round win at Wimbledon in 2010, it nonetheless earned a standing ovation from the crowd packed into one of Flushing Meadows' outside courts.

Hansi Flick, the new manager of Germany, has told Bild that Thomas Muller still has an important part to play for the national team. Flick coached Bayern Munich for two seasons during which Muller was an integral part of the team. Scoring 29 goals and 50 assists in 96 appearances was very impressive, but it wasn't the most important role Muller played for Flick's team. ""I don't know if there is a specific position for Thomas, it feels like he runs all over the place in the game. He's a player that gives you more joy than headaches,"" said Flick.

Flick's first major event as manager of the national team will be the World Cup in Qatar in 2022, and he's expecting Muller to play a key role. ""He's a player who is enormously important for any coach because he knows what to do, how to build the team. That's why he's an important factor,"" Flick told Bild. Of course, Muller is not the only attacker Germany can call on. There are Timo Werner, Kai Havertz, and of course, Leroy Sane. Bayern paid 49 million euros (about $57.8 million) in 2020 summer to land Sane from Manchester City, expecting him to carry the team's offense from the right wing. However, it did not work so well last season in which Sane had 10 goals and 12 assists in 44 games. That's where rumors of Sane and Flick falling out came from. The 56-year-old manager denied those rumors in the interview, saying ""there are no grudges held at all"" between him and Sane.

Lionel Messi made his Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) debut on Sunday, coming off the bench in the second half of their Ligue 1 game against Reims. The Argentine was introduced as a substitute in the 66th minute, replacing Neymar, with PSG leading 2-0 at the time thanks to a brace from Kylian Mbappe.

Red Bull Racing's Max Verstappen won F1's shortest race on Sunday, a wet Belgian Grand Prix with no overtaking that was called off as soon as enough safety car-led laps had been completed to award half-points.

With no actual racing allowed, the Dutchman secured his sixth win of the season ahead of Britain's George Russell, who had put Williams on the front row with a stunning display in a wet qualifying on Saturday.

Championship leader Lewis Hamilton, who again missed out on the chance to secure a record-extending 100th win, was third for Mercedes.

It was only the sixth time since the first championship in 1950 that half points had been awarded, and Hamilton's lead over Verstappen in the overall standings dwindled to just three points.

Red Bull also cut their deficit to Mercedes in the constructors' standings to seven.

""It's a big shame to not do proper laps but the conditions were very tricky out there,"" said Verstappen after sealing his 16th career win and first at Spa.

""Of course, it's a win but it's not how you want to win."""

IAG-2021: China wins 'interaction race' stage of Clear Sky contest,"03:11

China has scored another win at the International Army Games held in Korla, northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. The event continued with the Clear Sky contest, involving six countries, namely, China, Russia, Belarus, Egypt, Uzbekistan and Venezuela. In the ""interaction race"" stage, air defense teams have to drive armored transport vehicles on a closed track of 9.5 kilometers. Along the route, they go through 12 obstacle courses like an anti-tank ditch and curve turns. This round of competition tests firing abilities against air targets. They're required to fire from six positions, using automatic rifles, anti-aircraft machine guns and portable air defense systems.

This year, five of the contestants are using the China-made Vanguard-2 infrared-guided surface-to-air missile, while Russia is using its Igla-S anti-aircraft missile. Both have a speed of 600 meters per second, with a maximum operational range of six kilometers. Scores are won if the missile reaches a point within five meters around the target. ""The hardest part is locating the target. Since the weather conditions were good today, I could see the target from start to finish. But we usually encounter cloudy weather during training. And if you can't see the target, you can't hit it,"" Tsering Wonchog, a gunner for the Chinese team in the Clear Sky contest.

The Clear Sky contest also involves shooting simulated helicopter targets and moving targets on the ground. It's a comprehensive test tackling physical, technical and psychological qualities of each participant. Yang Jinlong, chief of the Chinese team in the Clear Sky contest told CGTN in an interview: ""I think that, in real combat training, we should take in certain elements of the 'Clear Sky' contest. For example, in the course of maneuvering, lessons on how to combine elements like physical strength, skills and live fire exercises would improve the level of the army's combat training.""

Less than 24 hours before that interview, Liu lifted 198 kg in the men's 65 kg powerlifting event at the Tokyo Paralympics to win the gold on Friday. It's already the fourth Paralympic gold of his career. Liu revealed that 198 kg is his worst performance in nearly 15 years. ""We had no systematic training at all in the past two months due to COVID-19. Almost all athletes could only do 80 to 90 percent of their best,"" he said to Xinhua. Liu said he was going for a medal before the competition began but did not expect to win the gold. ""It's not perfect, but it's the best result.""

Liu recalled that he saw Amir Jafari Arangeh of Iran browsing through photos of his son during the match on Friday. When he reached the last one, a photo of a gold medal, Jafari stared at it for over 10 seconds. Liu said he knew Jafari was his biggest opponent at that moment. In the end, Jafari took the silver medal. Liu became very talkative when his son was mentioned. ""I asked my son before I came to Tokyo: How do you think your old man is gonna perform? He said 'You will be the first.' I thought he did not know what that means so I asked him again. 'What medal will the first, second and third get?' My son answered 'Gold, silver and bronze.'"" That's when Liu realized that his son knew exactly what first means in sports. ""Since then, every time I began to doubt myself, I would tell myself: My son believes in me."" Liu did not cry when he won gold in the previous Paralympics but he could help it in Tokyo. ""It has been a very difficult trip.""

The Chinese men's national football team are currently training in Doha, Qatar to prepare for the coming 2022 FIFA World Cup qualification game against Australia.

Midfielder Zhang Xizhe told Xinhua News Agency that this is their ""best chance"" to go for World Cup qualification and the players are more confident than they were five years ago. ""It's the best chance for the players of my generation. We have already come so far so we will give our best efforts in every game. All of us will do so to make the World Cup,"" he said.

China last reached this stage of World Cup qualification in 2016. But before that, the team had a 16-year-long absence from such competitions. Zhang noted that many players in the team five years ago had never played in games like that and so lacked confidence on the field. That affected their performance and was partly why China failed to make it to the World Cup in Russia.

""Now about half of the players took part in the tournament last time. They know what it was like and they are more confident,"" Zhang told Xinhua."

Chinese center Zhou Qi on Sunday announced he will not play in the coming 2021-2022 CBA season in a post on Sina Weibo. ""I announced I am quitting the whole season. I will persist in safeguarding the legitimate rights of players because that's my responsibility as a player,"" said 25-year-old Zhou. ""I hope what happened to me will spur the CBA league to set more reasonable standards and do a better job of protecting the legitimate rights of players. Meanwhile, I will submit supplementary materials to the Chinese Basketball Association as soon as possible. I expect the association to conduct a fair and just arbitration over the matter."" With two days remaining before the August 31 deadline for teams to register their rosters, few saw Zhou's announcement coming. However, it's not too surprising because the relationship between Zhou and the Xinjiang Flying Tigers fell apart a long time ago.

In summer 2020, the Flying Tigers let three key players ¨C Shirelijan Muxtar?, Kyranbek Makan and Yu Changdong ¨C go during the offseason. As a result, Zhou had to carry the team almost by himself and watched the Flying Tigers lose to the Shandong Heroes in the playoffs. Zhou has publicly expressed his resentment multiple times since then. He became a free agent this summer and wanted to leave the Flying Tigers. However, according to league rules, the Flying Tigers have the exclusive right to sign Zhou as long as they offer a maximum contract, which is about 6 million yuan (about $927,099) per year. Meanwhile, there seems to be no team reaching out to the Flying Tigers trying to land Zhou, leaving the Flying Tigers with no reason to let him go. Zhou and his agent previously lodged a complaint to the league but it was rejected by a collegial panel consisting of representatives of five teams. Things reached a deadlock between Zhou and the Flying Tigers until Zhou made the announcement on Sunday.

It's hard to rule which side is wrong over the above disputes. What Zhou is after is in the interest of the player. His contract with the team ended and he wants to leave, so he does not want to sign a new contract with the team regardless of the number on it. The Flying Tigers also did nothing wrong. They are operating in accordance with the league rules over the contract signing with Zhou. After investing so much to acquire Zhou from Liaoning's youth team at the beginning, the Flying Tigers surely do not want to watch him leave now. The rules in this matter may sound unreasonable, but the league came up with them to protect the interests of the teams. By giving the teams exclusive rights to keep their best players with maximum deals, the league wants to make sure that every team, especially the weak ones, can remain competitive, for the sake of both games and finances.

But Jurgen Klopp's men failed to make their man advantage count in the second half as the European champions showed resilience to dig out a precious point that strengthened their title credentials.

Olympic champion Elaine Thompson-Herah stormed to victory in the women's 100m final at the Paris Diamond League on Saturday, although the 33-year-old world record remains frustratingly out of reach.

The Jamaican star clocked a meet record of 10.72 seconds to see off compatriot and Tokyo bronze medalist Shericka Jackson in 10.97.

Thompson-Herah, 29, who won three golds in Tokyo with triumphs in the 100m, 200m and 4x100m relay, has been threatening Florence Griffith-Joyner's world record of 10.49 set back in 1988.

Last weekend in Eugene, she ran the second-fastest time in history of 10.54 and then timed 10.64 in Lausanne on Thursday behind fellow Jamaican Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce's 10.60, the third-fastest ever mark.

""The world record is a short-term goal; it's quite close, but if I end the season without taking it, it doesn't matter,"" said Thompson-Herah.

Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) could try to chase Robert Lewandowski of Bayern Munich, Erling Haaland of Borussia Dortmund, or Richarlison of Everton to replace Kylian Mbappe, who's being eyed by Real Madrid, ESPN has reported. The French club has not yet agreed to the 180-million-euro (about $212.3 million) offer by Real Madrid for Mbappe but talks reportedly continued on Friday. Though Real's new offer is unlikely to sway PSG, the French side is also not very determined to keep Mbappe in their squad, especially considering that Mbappe only has one year left of his current contract.

Meanwhile, ESPN has revealed that Lewandowski's agent Pini Zahavi was in Paris on Monday, recommending his client to PSG. The Polish striker scored 48 goals in 40 games for Bayern last season. In fact, he's never had fewer than 40 goals in any of the past six seasons with the German giants, winning seven Bundesliga titles, three DFB-Pokal championships, five DFL-Supercup titles, one UEFA Champions League trophy, one UEFA Super Cup title and one FIFA Club World Cup championship for Bayern. Lewandowski is reportedly looking for a new challenge after his glorious career in Bayern. He still has two years left of his current deal with the German club and it will definitely take a generous offer to convince Bayern to let him go.

Haaland, 21, has been another popular target on the transfer market. He scored 41 goals in 41 appearances for Dortmund last season. There is a 75-million-euro (about $88.5 million) release clause in his current contract with the club and it will come into effect next year. If PSG want to land Haaland in 2021, they may need to offer Dortmund 200 million euros (about $236 million), which is reportedly the price they want for Mbappe. Haaland's agent Mino Raiola has worked with PSG's sporting director Leonardo to bring Gianluigi Donnarumma from AC Milan to PSG for free this summer.

Confusing move: Cavaliers acquire Lauri Markkanen via sign-and-trade,"Lauri Markkanen is traded by the Chicago Bulls to the Cleveland Cavaliers. /CFP Lauri Markkanen is traded by the Chicago Bulls to the Cleveland Cavaliers. /CFP

The Cleveland Cavaliers reached agreement with the Chicago Bulls and the Portland Trail Blazers on a three-team trade which saw restricted free agent Lauri Markkanen join the Cavaliers on a sign-and-trade deal, according to ESPN. 24-year-old Markkanen received a four-year, $67-million contract. The Trail Blazers had Larry Nance Jr. who has two years, $20 million left of his contract. The Bulls got a 2023 second-round draft pick, a 2022 first-rounder (lottery protected) and Derrick Jones Jr., who has only one year, $9.7 million left of his current deal.

Both Portland and Chicago got what they needed from the trade. Though Nance suffered injury and only played 35 games for the Cavaliers last season, he is an underestimated big-man defender who can switch to cover perimeter players and contribute 1.7 steals per game. He can give Portland more defensive options than simply closing in around the paint. Jones Jr. has good size and athleticism as a wing defender. With him in the roster, the Bulls can put DeMar DeRozan in the shooting guard position, avoiding watching him become a defensive liability in mismatch. Though there was only very limited Jones Jr. could do offensively, the Bulls have Zach LaVine, DeRozan and Nikola Vucevic to worry about that. By contrast, the Cavaliers' intention of making this deal is confusing. Their paint was already very crowded before the trade. Replacing Nance Jr. with Markkanen won't make it better.

The Cavaliers gave Jarett Allen a five-year, $100-million contract extension, obviously making him part of their future plan. They drafted Evan Mobley, a 2.13-meter-tall, 20-year-old big men from the University of Southern California with the third overall pick in July. Young men require time to grow, especially big men in today's NBA. Moreover, don't forget that Kevin Love is still on the roster of the Cavaliers. The team must give him time to play on the court, either because he can help, or to show other teams that he's still valuable. Of the above three, Allen is the rim protector; Mobley is the promising young blood; Love is the experienced veteran who can score and stretch the spacing. What can Markkanen offer to the Cavaliers that one of the three can't provide?

Borussia Dortmund's Erling Haaland scored the winner in added time on Friday to snatch a dramatic 3-2 win at home to Hoffenheim in the Bundesliga.

Hoffenheim equalized twice as goals by Dortmund teenagers Giovanni Reyna and Jude Bellingham were canceled out by Christoph Baumgartner and then Munas Dabbur, who leveled in the 90th minute.

However, Haaland made sure of the three points for Dortmund when he smashed his sixth goal this season into the net in the 91st minute.

U.S. Open spectators now must show proof of at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine to attend matches, a change made less than 72 hours before the tennis tournament starts. The U.S. Tennis Association (USTA) announced on Friday that the New York City mayor's office decided to require proof of vaccination to go into Arthur Ashe Stadium, the main arena at the National Tennis Center. The USTA then opted to extend that rule to cover all ticket-holders 12 years and older who enter the grounds during the two-week Grand Slam tournament that begins on August 30. The event is returning to 100 percent capacity after all fans were banned from attending a year ago because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Earlier in the week, the USTA said spectators would not be required to wear masks or show proof of their vaccination status to attend matches at the U.S. Open. The tournament operated without fans in 2020.

Manchester United soccer club has announced that it has re-signed Cristiano Ronaldo. The record-breaking Portuguese forward represented the English club between 2003 and 2009, winning three Premier Leagues and a Champions League.

Already holding the records for the most goals (134) and assists (42) in the Champions League, this summer, he became the record goalscorer in European Championships finals (14) and is now tied for the most goals in international soccer (109).

Born on the Portuguese archipelago of Madeira, Ronaldo represented the Lisbon club Sporting before first moving to Manchester as a promising teenager. He later joined Real Madrid in Spain, becoming the club's all-time top goalscorer with 451 in 438 games.

Ambassadors' China Story,"04:56

In the previous episode of the ¡°Ambassador¡¯s China Story¡± launched by CGTN Global Stringer, 81-year-old South Korean former ambassador Kwon Byong-hyon took us back to his remarkable experiences in China. In the second episode, the legendary account of a 76-year-old former Spanish ambassador awaits us...

CGTN Photo CGTN Photo

¡°My diplomatic career began when I was 38. That¡¯s quite an exception as most start when they are around 50. I have been the ambassador to China three times, which is extremely rare in Spain¡¯s or even the world¡¯s diplomatic history. My friend always jokingly says that this was history in the making. ¡± Eugenio Bregolat, Spain¡¯s former ambassador

Drinking Longjing Tea (i.e. Dragon Well tea, a variety of green tea from Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, China), listening to The Butterfly Lovers (a Chinese legend of the tragic love between Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai), reading the collection of poems by Li Bai (a Chinese Tang-Dynasty poet) and studying Deng Xiaoping Theory¡­ Obviously, this Spanish elder has perfectly integrated into Chinese society. But the beginning of his story dates back to the 1980s. Before he took up his first diplomatic tenure in China, Bregolat spent a month traveling this country. ¡°I remember in that tour group, there were mostly Americans. And there were few foreigners in China,¡± he recalled. They crossed the Yangtze River and visited cities like Xi¡¯an and Shanghai. The vast expanse of the landscape, the changing topography, as well as the colorful culture greatly impressed Bregolat. But it was the people that warmed his heart. ¡°Once, I was on the Nanshan scenic spot of Chongqing, I saw a group of Chinese dancing. And one of them invited me to dance with them. Such a scene is still alive in my memory. From then on, I fell in love with China.¡± Before long, Eugenio took up the position as the ambassador to China in 1986. He later returned for two more tenures, which allowed him to witness the biggest change in this country. He wrote down everything he observed in his notebook.

Eugenio Bregolat (L) and Li Xiannian (R); Bregolat was the ambassador to China from 1986-1991, 1999-2003 and 2011-2013. Eugenio Bregolat (L) and Li Xiannian (R); Bregolat was the ambassador to China from 1986-1991, 1999-2003 and 2011-2013.

¡°But ten years later, when I came back to China, I could see a 30-floor building when I walked out of the embassy and crossed Liangmaqiao. In the evening, neon lights, traveling cars, skyscrapers and cabs were everywhere (only the high-class hotels had cabs before). And restaurants were dotted on the street lines. Modernity was very much in the air. After another ten years, all the narrow streets turned to city malls. How fast that change was. Unbelievable!¡±

How does a visually impaired person take photography?

Visually impaired since birth, Brazilian Teco Barbero fell in love with photography when he was in journalism school. It was then that he developed a technique that allowed him to handle a camera and take photographs, even though he only has five percent of his vision. As a journalist and photographer, Barbero currently lives in the city of Sorocaba, in the interior of Brazil.

In this video, we will see how he actually takes photos with his 'eye'. He first walks to the character that he is going to photograph, to find his or her face, and then he places his thumb on the camera. By doing this, he assures the person's face will be properly framed, after that he takes two steps back and presses the shutter.

Barbero says he doesn't care if he can properly see those pictures, he cares more about what others see. The photos are his expressions of what he sees. For him, his camera is his new horizon and it can extend around the world."

As hospitals across the U.S. struggle to treat COVID-19 patients, some states are running out of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) beds. Alabama, Georgia, Texas, Florida and Arkansas have less than 10% of beds available, according to Department of Health and Human Services data.

U.S. intelligence community divided on COVID-19 origins,"The U.S. intelligence community was unable to reach a conclusive assessment about the origins of COVID-19 after a 90-day investigation.

President Joe Biden ordered the investigation, which was wrapped up with an inconclusive, unclassified summary released to the public on Friday by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.

Although the report blames China for the uncertainty surrounding the virus, it admits Chinese officials ""did not have foreknowledge of the virus before the initial outbreak.""

China has repeatedly urged the U.S. to respect science and stop politicizing COVID-19 origins tracing and twice invited WHO experts in for the origins tracing.

While the investigation of COVID-19's origins is inconclusive, the report did state the virus was not developed as a biological weapon or was genetically engineered.

During the administration of former U.S. President Donald Trump, then Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and some other State Department officials had peddled a conspiracy theory that the virus was a potential biological weapon created in China.

Why the White House has backed down from the 'Wuhan Lab Theory'

The intelligence agencies involved in the report are divided on their theories of the virus's origins.

Some believe with low confidence that COVID-19 was likely caused by natural exposure to an animal.

Another agency assessed with moderate confidence the first human infection most likely came from a lab accident.

And other agencies wanted more information before agreeing with either theory, saying the study ""lacks clinical samples or a complete understanding of epidemiological data from the earliest COVID-19 cases.""

According to the WHO report on the global tracing of COVID-19 origins released in March, COVID-19 introduction through an intermediate host is ""likely to very likely,"" introduction through cold/food chain products is ""possible,"" and introduction through a laboratory incident is ""extremely unlikely."""

About 10 million children in Afghanistan need humanitarian assistance to survive, according to the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF).

UNICEF warns that 4.2 million of children are out of school. Some 435,000 kids are internally displaced. The UN has recorded more than 2,000 violations of children's rights since January.

A severe drought, water shortages, COVID-19, the oncoming winter and now the Taliban are all factors impacting the humanitarian needs of people in Afghanistan.

UNICEF expects the humanitarian crisis to get worse.

The organization says it will stay in Afghanistan in the days to come.

According to the World Food Programme (WFP), one-third of the country's population is facing food insecurity.

They're asking for $200 million by the end of the year, so they can keep working in Afghanistan after the Taliban's takeover.

Without this funding, WFP Executive Director David Beasley says the program will start to run out of food in September, reports Al Jazeera.

Beasley adds, the Taliban has assured the WFP can continue to provide aid to Afghanistan.

""So far they [the Taliban] have calibrated, cooperated and given us the access we need,"" he told Al Jazeera."

In recent weeks, events in Afghanistan have put the country in the spotlight once again after years of it drifting off the world's news radar. But for those of us with a personal link to the embattled nation, political instability and devastating war have sadly become all too familiar. The next time you meet an Afghan, ask them if they recall their parents talking about politics and the country's countless conflicts at family gatherings. I'll bet almost all of them do.

The story of war and migration is one that has touched all Afghans. I was born in London five years after my parents left Afghanistan. It was the Soviet invasion in 1979 that caused the first major exodus from the country in the 1980s. Few could have predicted that 42 years later, people would still be forcibly displaced as a result of violence, which the overwhelming majority has nothing to do with.

It has been almost 20 years since the U.S.-led invasion toppled the Taliban government, which ruled Afghanistan from 1996 to 2001. What transpired in the following two decades was a failed attempt at state-building, if the ease with which the government and its armed forces collapsed are anything to go by. Western officials ¨C including U.S. President Joe Biden ¨C have said they were surprised by how quickly the Taliban took over the country. Barely 10 days after taking its first provincial capital, it captured Kabul. But for those of us who've been closely observing events, the structural weaknesses of the Afghan government were plain to see. There are many factors that have contributed to the collapse of the state but some key dates and issues stand out.

Endemic corruption Given the nature of its tribal society and its notoriously difficult landscape, the U.S. and its international allies used a collection of warlords in the fight against the Taliban in 2001. These were men who made a name for themselves ¨C not always positively ¨C during the resistance against the Soviets and the ensuing civil war in the early 1990s. As the western focus shifted to setting up a political structure, many of the leaders were given senior government roles as billions of dollars of aid and military support began trickling in. The result was a culture of cronyism and endemic corruption that permeated Afghan society and was very often linked to the top. The United Nations' former deputy special envoy for Afghanistan, Peter Galbraith, told the BBC that coalition partners ""never seriously tried to address the corruption that was prevalent from the top."" He added: ""The local partner was corrupt, ineffective, illegitimate."" Under the leadership of Hamid Karzai and his successor Ashraf Ghani, Afghanistan constantly ranked among the most corrupt countries in the world. According to Transparency International's Corruption Index, it ranked 165 out of 180 nations in 2020. To put it into perspective, analysis by Brown University in April estimated the war cost the U.S. alone $2.26 trillion. Many other countries were involved in funding the conflict, aid and reconstruction efforts and pouring billions into the nation.

Crisis of governance The widespread prevalence of corruption did little to endear the government to Afghans. The country's political structure didn't help either. From the off, the system imposed was a highly centralized state, with the president inheriting significant powers with few checks and balances. On paper, they existed ¨C such as the largely ceremonial parliament ¨C but in practice, the president's signature was sacrosanct. Hamid Karzai was appointed interim leader in 2002 and won his first election in 2004. Five years later, he was re-elected as president amid reports of widespread electoral fraud. In 2014, former finance minister Ashraf Ghani was sworn in as his successor, in another disputed election, which was mired in allegations of vote-rigging and ballot boxes being fiddled with. In both instances, the apparent loser was Abdullah Abdullah, a sharply dressed politician who was a figure of the Northern Alliance resistance to the Soviets and the Taliban.

Former Afghan President Hamid Karzai, second left, accompanied by the old government's main peace envoy, Abdullah Abdullah, recently held talks with members of a Taliban delegation. /Dr Abdullah Abdullah via Facebook/Handout via Reuters.

Both he and Ghani traded accusations of fraud, which led to months of paralysis and a failure to form a new government. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry had to fly in to mediate and the result was a so-called ""National Unity Government."" Ghani would remain president, while a new role of chief executive of Afghanistan was created for Abdullah. The result was a further fracturing of governance and a true turning point for attempts to nation-build. Regardless of its intentions, the move eroded the government's ¨C and particularly Ghani's ¨C legitimacy in the eyes of many Afghans. The 2019 presidential election involved the same two front-runners. The result was predictably the same ¨C allegations of fraud, months of political crisis, two parallel governments being set up and finally, another power-sharing deal reached almost eight months later in May 2020. According to the country's Independent Election Commission, voter turnout was less than 20 percent ¨C far lower than the approximately 60 percent recorded in 2004. Throughout the past two decades, the U.S.-backed government in Kabul has been beset by political problems. Despite the scenes in bustling cities, many Afghans had little day-to-day involvement with state institutions and few viewed the political establishment as working in their favor. That has been a constant theme in the years I have been speaking to people there.

Security weaknesses ""We spent over a trillion dollars. We trained and equipped an Afghan military force of some 300,000 strong,"" that was what Biden said about the Afghan security forces days after the Taliban's rapid offensive. In reality, the true number was much smaller. So-called ""ghost"" soldiers and police officers have been a defining characteristic of the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF). It's an example of how intertwined the fundamental problems above were. Corruption meant salaries were collected for soldiers who didn't exist and poor governance allowed it to go on. Despite the eye-watering amounts of money spent on training the ANSF, they have long suffered from structural deficiencies. Aside from being poorly equipped in places, high rates of absenteeism and drug abuse were common, as were concerns of low morale and ethnic divisions being reinforced in the army and police. The issues have been well-documented but rarely made international headlines. Throughout the conflict, there has been a fascination with the numbers trained ¨C i.e. quantitative targets at the direct expense of qualitative progress.

Businesses in the UK are calling for urgent clarity over the rules around self-isolating when staff come into contact with someone who has tested positive with COVID-19.

The British Retail Consortium said workers and suppliers who are double-jabbed should be exempt from the requirements, given that they have worked throughout the pandemic.

On Monday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson ¨C who is himself self-isolating ¨C said ""critical workers"" wouldn't need to quarantine, but has since apologized for growing confusion about the guidance.

There was set to be a list of those who would be exempt from any rules but that plan was subsequently shelved, with the government saying exemptions would be considered on a ""case-by-case basis"" instead. However, pressure has mounted on officials to do more to resolve the issue.

In another apparent U-turn, Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng, said new guidance on exemptions for ""specific sectors"" was now being worked on and will be released on Wednesday. But he said there was ""no need for panic.""

""I don't think there's any cause at all for the kind of alarmist, in some instances, panic but I am very mindful of the fact that businesses and other people are very concerned,"" he said. ""I understand that, but I think we shouldn't try and create a false sense of alarm.""

Cases rising

The pingdemic issue risks overshadowing Johnson's decision to end almost all legal coronavirus restrictions on Monday. Many health experts had warned the move could be premature, with cases rising sharply in the UK.

On Wednesday, more than 44,000 people tested positive for COVID-19. In the last seven days, the total was almost 335,000 ¨C a rise of 36 percent on the previous week. With rules now relaxed, those figures are expected to rise further.

While the new guidance for key sectors could help minimize the disruption being reported, for others who are not exempt but have been double-jabbed, Kwarteng said current rules requiring self-isolation when pinged would remain in place until August 16."

Testing children for the COVID-19 vaccine,"For more than six months now, people have rolled up their sleeves for the COVID-19 vaccine. More than 180 million Americans have received at least one dose, but one group has not been part of the effort: young children.



""I was really lucky to have this chance, so I really did not want to turn it down.""



Nine-year-old Daemo Gregorie-Cradick is part of the new Pfizer vaccine trial being conducted by Children¡¯s Hospital Colorado and some 80 other medical facilities. More than two-thousand kids ages 5-11 are part of the study.



""We will get an idea of whether children who got the vaccine were protected and know their immune response.""



Dr. Eric Simoes is leading Colorado¡¯s portion of the trial in which two-thirds of participants receive the vaccine and one-third a placebo. Based on his first shot, Daemo thinks he got the real thing.



""Kind of like in a way a shiver going down my arm, and that¡¯s never happened before.""



Until now, children under 12, like Daemo, have not been a vaccine priority. Their rates of COVID-19 infection and risk of severe disease are lower than adults.



That's prompted some experts to urge caution, that too much remains unknown about possible vaccine risks. But the COVID-19 virus has proven fatal to a small number of kids. Simoes says it's no time to hold back.



""We can't predict which child is going to have signs and symptoms that bring the child to the hospital, therefore it behooves us to protect children.""



Especially, he says, when more virulent and contagious disease variants pose a serious threat.



""Why wait for it to happen before we try to prevent it. Don't wait for the hurricane to come before you put shutters on the windows.""



""If you become less ill from the virus then you have less chances of spreading the virus to other people, so if everybody becomes vaccinated, there's less spread going on.""



Daemo's father says kids' lack of social distancing make the vaccine even more of a priority.



""I look and see how groups of people work and play together, this group plays closer in proximity to one another than any other group. Like I don't see my colleagues and tackle them.""



This part-time fisherman says he¡¯s always interested in learning. He was chosen by lottery for this trial and believes he hit the jackpot with this opportunity.



""Some of my friends didn¡¯t really believe I was going to do this.""



If he got the placebo, he'll receive the actual vaccine in six months. Pfizer expects data from the study this fall and could ask regulators for emergency approval of the drug soon after.

UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson rejected concerns raised by German Chancellor Angela Merkel during a visit to Britain that big crowds at upcoming Euro 2020 football matches in London could accelerate COVID-19.

Johnson, speaking alongside Merkel at a joint news conference, said that he'd follow the ""scientific guidance"" and he did not plan to order a reduction in crowds attending matches at Wembley Stadium.

Crowd capacity at Wembley will increase to more than 60,000 fans for the semi-finals and final of Euro 2020 under a pilot scheme announced last week.

""The crucial point is that ... here in the UK, we have built up a very considerable wall of immunity against the disease by our vaccination program,"" Johnson stated.

""The position is very clear in the UK, which is that we have certain events which we can put on in a very careful and controlled manner with testing of everybody who goes there,"" he added.

Merkel expressed her worry about European football's governing body UEFA's decision to allow bigger crowds amid a spike in the coronavirus crisis caused by the Delta variant.

""I am worried and skeptical about whether this is good,"" Merkel said at the same news conference.

China's UK ambassador calls for closer trade ties despite 'headwinds',"China's new ambassador to the UK says he hopes trade ties between the two countries can be strengthened, despite ""headwinds"" in their relationship.

Zheng Zeguang was making his first public appearance as ambassador at a webinar celebrating 20 years of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce in the UK.

China is the UK's fifth-largest trading partner, with bilateral trade in goods and services worth $112 billion a year.

But a series of high-profile disagreements on key issues has raised political tensions between the governments in London and Beijing.

They include the future of Hong Kong and retaliatory sanctions over allegations of human rights abuses in Xinjiang ¨C something China strongly denies.

""China creates opportunities for the UK rather than poses a threat,"" said Zheng.

""The sound development of China-UK relations will provide a stable and predictable macro-environment for the enterprises of our two countries.""

Over the past two decades, the economic relationship has improved significantly. Exports either way have risen almost 900 percent during that period, according to Sherard Cowper-Coles, chair of the China-Britain Business Council.

""There are now more than 800 Chinese-owned companies trading in the UK, employing some 75,000 people throughout the country. So, trade may sound like quite an abstract relationship but for me it's about real people making, buying and selling real things,"" he said.

Bilateral ties may have peaked under former Prime Minister David Cameron, who ushered in a so-called ""Golden Era"" of relations with the world's second largest economy. But several high-profile deals have since been reviewed, with the current political environment in the UK a lot more wary of Chinese investment, especially in key, sensitive areas of the economy.

Last year, telecoms firm Huawei was banned from taking part in the UK's 5G networks ¨C a decision the company said would cost the country billions of dollars.

Zheng said the countries were now at a ""critical juncture"" and it was ""even more important that businesses keep working"" to improve ties.

Commenting on the political tensions, he added: ""It is not surprising that we have different views on certain issues, but the key is to respect core interests and major concerns."""

Treating COVID-19 long-haulers,"22-year-old Devin Kadis of Colorado contracted COVID-19 last August. She immediately went into quarantine and began thinking about recovery.

""I definitely was very sick. I was bedridden, I had all the symptoms pretty much besides a fever actually.""

She soon began to feel better but then¡­""Everything started to go downhill again.""

She started experiencing what she calls 'body crashes.'

""I couldn¡¯t move. My friends had to pick me up physically off the ground and put me in bed, and I couldn¡¯t even speak. I was slurring all my words.""

The loss of smell, occasional trouble breathing, and brain fog continued into the fall.

""I didn¡¯t need the answer, I know there weren¡¯t answers yet, but I just needed somebody to make sure that I was okay.""

Eventually she landed at UCHealth University of Colorado Hospital, one of at least 33 U.S. medical facilities that are meeting this so-called long-hauler syndrome head-on.

""I think it¡¯s being recognized as a much bigger problem as people are starting to recover from COVID.""

Dr. Natasha Altman helps run this post-COVID clinic which employs a variety of specialists to try to get a handle on what ails patients like Kadis and help them, somehow, someway.

""Long-hauler syndrome is a bizarre, often debilitating by-product of COVID-19. It¡¯s marked by strange, wildly different symptoms. Doctors don't know what causes it.""

""There's something that the virus is doing I think either to the autonomic nervous system or how it's impacting the heart itself or the other organs as well.""

On this day, Altman, a cardiologist, put Kadis through a treadmill stress test to determine whether heart issues were causing her exercise intolerance. Heart muscle inflammation and persistent high heart rates are two post-COVID symptoms. This syndrome affects a wide range of Americans.

The non-profit organization FAIR Health found nearly one-quarter of those who contracted COVID-19 experienced at least one new medical condition one month after infection, including a number of people who had mild or no symptoms initially.

""We have not seen this burden of persistent illness in people who are not hospitalized with this type of respiratory infection previously.""

UC Health doctors have found that recumbent exercise, lots of fluids and time are three things that tend to help their patients.

""I would definitely say one size doesn't fit all.""

""I would never want this to happen to anyone else, because it's been tough.""

Kadis, who despite the reluctance of some in the medical community to take long-hauler syndrome seriously, has been reassured it's not in her head, it's a real thing.

""The fact that I can work out again, the fact that I can smell again, means that I will be back to normal soon.""

A month after this interview, she says she¡¯s now nearly recovered. She's one of the lucky ones. With this clinic's help, it appears she's finally shown COVID-19 the door."

A new study by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is showing evidence of possible COVID-19 infections in the U.S. as early as December 2019.

That's weeks before the first documented infection in the country.

Published in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases, this new report supports previous studies that have shown COVID-19 was circulating in the U.S. in the first two months of 2020.

Scientists at NIH say a volunteer from Illinois who gave blood on January 7, 2020 for a different study tested positive for COVID-19 antibodies.

Antibodies take about 14 days to develop, indicating the virus might have been present in Illinois as early as December.

The first reported U.S. infection was confirmed on January 20 in Washington state. The patient had traveled from Wuhan, China.

England's Covid-19 restrictions could be extended: UK health minister,"02:24

The UK government is willing to delay the fourth and final step out of England's lockdown set for June 21, according to health secretary Matt Hancock. The date is when all social restrictions are due to be eased in the country as part of a roadmap that has seen rules gradually lifted since March.

But speaking to the BBC on Sunday, Hancock said officials were ready to push back the process ""if that's what needs to happen"". With more than 40 million people receiving at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine in the UK, the risk of hospitalization and death as a result of COVID-19 has reduced significantly. But, in recent weeks, infections have risen sharply. According to government data, in the last 7 days, there were more than 31,000 new cases - a 46 percent rise on the previous week. That has led to concerns that opening up further will spread the virus, in particular, the Delta variant first discovered in India.

Opening the summit, which is tackling a broad range of issues from climate to recovery from the pandemic, UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the nations ""need to meet our ambitions on tackling climate change and ensuring that the way we tax large, global, especially digital, companies is fair and fit for the modern age.""

In a letter on Friday, the finance ministers of France, Italy and Germany said they would work together to define ""a common position on a new international tax system"" at the meetings.

U.S. Treasury Secretary, Janet Yellen, has proposed a minimum global tax rate of 15 percent. That is significantly lower than most G7 states currently have in place, but the plans were expected to face opposition from other economies that benefit from multinationals setting up bases there. Ireland - a member of the European Union - has a corporate tax rate of 12.5 percent, for example.

And there is likely to be plenty of opposition from the companies affected, especially global tech firms whose services are digital and naturally unconstrained by borders.

In recent years, some governments have called for the likes of Facebook and Google to pay more taxes in the countries they operate in and when they benefit from people using their services. The UK and France are two nations that have planned a digital services tax on technology giants.

Such moves were strongly opposed by president Trump but his successor in the White House, Joe Biden, has shown more willingness to tax large corporations.

Sunak said the fact that tech firms were so dominant in our daily lives meant new rules needed to be established.

""It is increasingly clear that in a complex, global, digital economy, we cannot continue to rely on a tax system that was largely designed in the 1920s. And I will just say this: the world has noticed. And I believe they have high expectations for what we all can agree over the coming days.""

Any concrete progress out of the London meetings will require broader support though. A gathering of the wider G20 economies in Italy in June is one possible date when more international consensus can be tested.

The stakes are high but any changing of the rules will face strong resistance from governments and businesses alike.

Vlogger: American media bear responsibility for rise in hate crimes,"Hate attacks targeting Asians and Asian Americans have escalated in the United States, fueling protests and outrage among many people.

However, the mainstream media in the United States, CNN and Fox News falsely smear China and at the same time advocate for treating Asian people kindly.

American vlogger Shangguan Jiewen believes these media outlets bear responsibility for the rise in anti-Asian hate crimes, as they have been repeating some of the discriminatory and anti-Chinese words of American leaders, leading the American public to be anti-Asian and anti-Chinese.

He says American media outlets like CNN and Fox News must stop making hateful comments, only in this way can Asian people enjoy equal rights in America."
UK hospitals turn to e-cigarettes in fight against tobacco,"The UK government is handing out electronic cigarettes (e-cigs) at hospitals to try to help people stop smoking.

The trial scheme provides vaping starter kits to patients after they have visited emergency wards. It is initially being tested at four hospitals in England and Edinburgh's Royal Infirmary in Scotland.

Research has shown that e-cigs can help people quit tobacco, according to Caitlin Notley, professor of addiction sciences at the University of East Anglia, which is helping with the trials.

""We know from the latest evidence that e-cigarettes are now the most popular consumer choice for those who are deciding to switch from tobacco smoking. Perhaps a really attractive option because they're not necessarily a medical device so people can go and buy them, they can try different strengths, different types and find something that suits their needs,"" she told CGTN Europe.

The plan is hoping to reach 1,000 participants in total, with some being monitored for progress at one-, three- and six-month intervals.

The government's backing of e-cigarettes could be significant for the UK's fight against tobacco-related illnesses. Data reviewed by Public Health England estimates that vaping is 95 percent less harmful than tobacco smoking.

May 31 marks World No Tobacco Day. Every year, 78,000 people die from smoking in the UK, with many more living with serious illnesses.

""If we can show that the intervention is effective at helping people to switch from smoking, then clearly there are important cost implications as well,¡± said Notley.

""A vape starter kit might cost around 20 pounds ($28) but the long-term savings for the health service in terms of not having to treat tobacco-related illness are potentially billions of pounds.""

If successful, the trial could see the UK's National Health Service regularly provide e-cigarettes.

That would be welcome news for the businesses selling the products. John Garcia, manager of a vaping shop in south London, said most customers are existing smokers looking to kick the habit ¨C a trend that's accelerated recently due to COVID-19.

""You get the nicotine content without inhaling all the toxins that are in a cigarette and it's better because it doesn't ruin the teeth, they don't get stains on their fingers, it doesn't ruin your clothes or make them smell.""

But as a relatively nascent industry, the long-term health implications of vaping are still unclear, according to Notley: ""Most of the evidence we have at the moment comes from people who've switched from tobacco smoking, so any damage we might see may have already been caused by earlier tobacco smoking.""

There are also concerns around the addictiveness of vaping. But as things stand, UK policymakers see value in e-gigs as a harm-reduction option that is preferable to traditional forms of tobacco."

""It's been challenging but it's been a fun challenge getting ready for the reopening,"" said Helena Bates, interim curator of meteorites at the NHM.

Numbers will be restricted and those coming will need to pre-book time slots. There will also be social distancing measures in place and guests will need to wear masks.

With customers forced to stay away, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a major impact on the sector. At the NHM, 50 percent of revenue is derived from visitor-related income.

Government grants and funding have helped keep many theaters and museums going for the past year but there are concerns some smaller venues may have to shut for good because of financial pressures.

According to the UK Museums Association, 4,100 jobs have already been lost directly and indirectly in the sector. More could follow, particularly given the threat of more restrictions and lockdowns due to variants of concern being monitored by the UK government.

But for many people, being able to access arts and culture physically once again will be welcome news. Imogen, a mother of three from London and told CGTN Europe that museums are ""a really big part of [her family's] lives"".

UK local elections - what do results mean for United Kingdom's future?,"A referendum on the issue in 2014 saw voters narrowly support remaining in the union, by 55 to 46%.

Sturgeon called the results ""historic and extraordinary"" and said it shows there's a strong mandate to push ahead with what's become known as ""indyref2"". But, she added the priority is focusing on the ""Covid crisis"" but that ""when the time's right"", the SNP will seek to ask voters if they want to remain part of the UK.

The Scottish National Party (SNP) led by Nicola Sturgeon secured a fourth consecutive term in power after a strong performance in Scotland's parliamentary elections. With 64 seats, they fell one short of an outright majority but are expected to push ahead with plans for a second independence referendum.

Results from the UK's local elections have now been counted and there's plenty to digest. Calls for Scottish independence are likely to grow, there's been strong support for the union in Wales and Boris Johnson's Conservatives have cemented their power in England. CGTN Europe breaks down some of the key questions for you.

Is Scotland going to become independent?

There's no guarantee. There would have to be a referendum among Scottish voters first and that's certainly not going to happen while tackling the pandemic is the priority. Without a majority, the SNP will have to rely on other parties to back their bid to hold a poll. The most likely is The Green Party, which secured eight seats out of the 129 and has previously backed the idea of independence.

The bigger worry is how they'll do it. There are essentially two options. Under current laws which gave Scotland more devolved power in 1999, the UK's central government in Westminster would need to approve the holding of a referendum. Boris Johnson has made clear he will not support it.

The other route is the legal one. If the SNP chooses to take the UK government to court, it could end up in the Supreme Court in London. Speaking to the BBC on Sunday, Sturgeon said ""if it comes to being decided in the courts, that'll be the debate we have to have.""

But she added: ""I don't think we'll get there¡­ it would be such a grave, serious and undemocratic situation.""

Will Boris Johnson stop them?

The prime minister has repeatedly stated that he doesn't want the break up of the UK and said an attempt for a second referendum in the current context was ""irresponsible and reckless"".

In a bid to quash divisions, he's written to Sturgeon as well as the first minister of Wales and leaders of Northern Ireland calling for a ""Team UK"" summit to show ""unity"" in the fight against COVID-19.

The man charged with overseeing the union, cabinet office minister Michael Gove, urged the SNP to act cautiously and focus on jointly fighting the pandemic. He said national leaders couldn't ""take their eye off the ball by a protracted conversation about the constitution"".

He also said Scotland had the right to leave the UK if it wanted ruled out taking the matter to court if Scotland's parliament - led by the SNP - voted for an independence referendum.

What about Wales?

The SNP's success was in sharp contrast to the independence movement in Wales, where the nationalist Plaid Cyrmu picked up 13 seats, far short of the 31 needed for a majority. Worse still, a strong showing for the Conservatives saw it leapfrog Plaid Cyrmu to become the second biggest in the Welsh parliament.

Who won in London?

The incumbent mayor Sadiq Khan won but it was a closer race than expected. He needed a run-off with Conservative candidate Shaun Bailey after neither of them secured 50 percent of the votes after first preferences were counted.

In the end, Khan won by a margin of more than 228,000 votes. While seemingly decisive, the race in London echoed the progress made by the Conservatives elsewhere in England, boosted by the UK's recent success in delivering COVID-19 vaccines."
UK local elections - what are they and why do they matter?,"A man leaves the polling station after voting in London, Thursday, May 6, 2021. AP Photo/Frank Augstein A man leaves the polling station after voting in London, Thursday, May 6, 2021. AP Photo/Frank Augstein

Conservatives, Labour, Holyrood and the Senedd - don't worry, we know the UK's local politics can be confusing. But as results trickle in from one of the most important elections in recent times, CGTN Europe breaks down the main races for you and sheds some light on what they might mean.

Scotland The big one to watch is the Scottish parliamentary elections. Although the United Kingdom has a central government based mostly in the capital London, some power is devolved to the three other countries that make up the UK - Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. There are 129 members of the Scottish parliament based in Holyrood in the capital Edinburgh. Parties need to win 65 seats to rule with a majority. The Scottish National Party led by Nicola Sturgeon has vowed to push for a second independence referendum if it gets enough seats, saying she would offer Scotland ""the choice of a better future"". If it doesn't win outright, it can form a coalition with other parties which also want an independent Scotland - most likely the Green Party.

By Saturday morning the SNP had won 39 of the 48 seats announced. The expectation is that even if it falls short, there will be a pro-independence majority. That will not go down well with UK prime minister Boris Johnson, who told the Daily Telegraph a second referendum on the issue in the current context would be ""irresponsible and reckless"". The last referendum in 2014 saw voters narrowly choose to remain part of the UK, with 55 percent opting to remain in the union. Wales Like in Scotland, the current ruling party in Wales has done well in these elections. That's the Labour party, led by Mark Drakeford, who's also the first minister. The Welsh assembly is known as the Senedd and is based in the capital Cardiff, where 60 seats were up for grabs in Thursday's election. Labour had already won half of them by Saturday morning. That means it has equaled its best ever result and is set to hold on to power. There were calls for Welsh independence spearheaded by the nationalist Plaid Cymru party. It won nine seats on Friday - far short of the majority needed to govern.

England local councils In terms of scale, most of Thursday's elections were in England - the UK's most populous nation. Around 5,000 seats were voted for in 143 local councils across the country. Prime minister Boris Johnson's Conservative party has done well in the early results. After 89 councils announced ballots, the so-called Tories had already won seven more councils, and added 159 councilors on those bodies making local decisions. In contrast, the Labour party had lost 192 councilors and lost control of four councils. The results follow a similar trend in the 2019 general election when Boris Johnson secured a record victory by picking up traditional Labour seats promising to deliver Brexit. Then, he faced Jeremy Corbyn as leader of the main opposition. Now it's Keir Starmer, who's faced a backlash from within his party following the latest results. Starmer said he was ""bitterly disappointed"" but insisted he ""will take full responsibility for fixing things""."

The result continues a trend from the 2019 general election, which saw traditional Labour seats in the north of England fall to Boris Johnson's party.

""Not only that, I am the first woman ever to be elected as an MP for this town. It's a truly historic result and a momentous day,"" she said.

The winner, Jill Mortimer, said she was ""immensely proud to be the first Conservative MP in Hartlepool for 57 years.""

One of the most high-profile races was a by-election in Hartlepool in the north of England, which offered a seat in the UK's parliament in Westminster. The Conservatives won the seat for the first time since it became a constituency in 1974, taking it from the main opposition Labour Party.

Brexit was a critical factor in those victories and almost 70 percent of Hartlepool's residents voted to leave the European Union (EU) in the 2016 referendum. Labour's choice of candidate, Paul Williams, a former MP for a nearby constituency, was criticized as he campaigned to remain in the bloc.

Labour leader Keir Starmer has made a point of moving the party from the left toward the center of UK politics, espousing more nationalist policies, hiring allies of former Labour Prime Minister Tony Blair and promising to break with his left-wing predecessor Jeremy Corbyn.

Last night's results sparked criticism from the party's left.

Diane Abbott, shadow home secretary under Corbyn, tweeted: ""Keir Starmer must think again about his strategy."" Adding: ""Crushing defeat for Labour in Hartlepool. Not possible to blame Jeremy Corbyn for this result. Labour won the seat twice under his leadership.""

Scotland, Wales and London

Across the UK, more than 5,000 seats were up for grabs in the voting on Thursday. The majority of those were local councils in England.

City mayors were also being elected, including London, where the incumbent, Sadiq Khan, is expected to retain power.

In Wales and Scotland, people voted for regional devolved parliaments, which hold significant power. The two nations can make laws on issues such as health, education and policing.

The ruling Scottish National Party and several others, including the Greens, have voiced their backing for a second independence referendum for Scotland. In the last one in 2014, voters narrowly opted to remain part of the UK. Since then, support for independence has generally increased.

Depending on the latest results, calls for another referendum could increase tensions between Edinburgh and the UK government in Westminster.

Speaking as she voted on Thursday, Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon gave the prime minister a firm warning: ""He has no right to stand in the way of the people of Scotland making that choice, it is for Scotland to decide the future of the country not for any individual politician whether that's me or Boris Johnson.""

Some 129 members of the Scottish Parliament are to be elected, along with 60 members of the Welsh Parliament, known as the Senedd.

Vote counting began on Friday, with results across the UK being announced throughout the weekend.

Mastering Chinese Poetry: Get into the autumn evening with Wang Wei,"04:56

In Chinese beliefs, the full moon is a symbol of peace, harmony, luck and family reunion, that's one of the reasons why appreciating the full moon has become the highlight of the Mid-Autumn Festival, a well-known traditional Chinese festival that can be traced back to Tang Dynasty (618¨C907). People usually gather with their loved ones and share tasty meals and moon cakes for celebration. For Chinese writers and poets, the moon is not just about the festival, but also brings endless inspiration to them. In this episode of Mastering Chinese Poetry let's take the time machine and back into that peaceful autumn night in mountains with Chinese poet Wang Wei.

Autumn Evening in the Mountains After fresh rain in mountains bare; Autumn permeates evening air. Among pine-trees bright moonbeams peer; Over crystal stones flows water clear. Bamboos whisper of washer-maids; Lotus stirs when fishing boat wades. Though fragrant spring may pass away£¬ Still here's the place for you to stay. £¨Translated by Xu Yuanchong£©

Wang Wei is a renowned landscape poet and a talented landscape painter of Tang Dynasty. One of China's greatest poets Su Shi once commented on his work: ""Pictures in poems, poems in pictures."" I personally can't agree more, as Wang's poems always present a portray of imagery, like the poem above. k¨­ng sh¨¡n x¨©n y¨³ h¨°u£¬ ¿ÕÉ½ÐÂÓêºó£¬ ti¨¡n q¨¬ w¨£n l¨¢i qi¨±¡£ ÌìÆøÍíÀ´Çï¡£ ""After fresh rain in mountains bare; Autumn permeates evening air.""

At this moment, you may hear the breeze from forests, the sound of water running¡­ or you may hear nothing but your breath. The magic here is that there was no 3D or VR tech back then, but the poet Wang Wei can always take the readers into his scenery with a few simple words.

This poem is written during Wang Wei's seclusion in Zhongnan Mountains, Northwest China. It expresses his pursuit of the simple and quiet mountain life.

Interview with 'Balloon' cast: Human experiences in Tibetan context,"05:51

In a Tibetan family struggling to make ends meet, the mother of three finds herself pregnant with a fourth child. What should she do? The dilemma of keeping the baby and risking deeper poverty or aborting at the expense of sinning summarizes the tension between traditional beliefs and modern ideas. This is the premise of ""Balloon,"" the seventh feature of Tibetan filmmaker and author Pema Tseden, which hit cinemas across China on November 20. Set in the late 1990s in the austere but appealing highlands of northwest China's Qinghai Province, the Tibetan picture depicts a bittersweet story centered on three generations of a rural family, whose peaceful yet tough life is repeatedly disturbed by unexpected problems after the children steal the only condoms in the house to blow them up like balloons.

""I was once on the street in Zhongguancun (Beijing's tech hub) and I saw a red balloon floating in the air. I was attracted by the visuals, which were particularly suitable for a film,"" Tseden told CGTN in an interview.

The chance encounter triggered a lightbulb moment for the 51-year-old filmmaker. ""At that moment, I related this image to real Tibetan life, and I thought about a white balloon, which is a key element in this film: the condom,"" he said.

The contraceptive, which the children in the movie discover under their parents' pillow, prompts a series of embarrassing events, lands the family in an uneasy dilemma, and stirs up trouble between wife Drolkar and husband Dargye. Qinghai-born Tseden again turned his lens towards a familiar place ¨C his birthplace ¨C to depict the picturesque views of Qinghai Lake and the daily life of Tibetan shepherds. In his family drama, the filmmaker delves into the religious and traditional culture in which the ethnic group is rooted and explores the conflict between real-life concerns and spiritual ideals.

The lead roles are played by rising Tibetan actors Sonam Wangmo and Jinpa, who collaborated with Tseden on his last title ""Jinpa,"" which bagged the Best Screenplay Award at the 2019 Venice International Film Festival's Horizon section.

Speaking about their third cooperation, Jinpa said there was a tacit understanding with the director and sometimes their rapport did not need words. ""The director didn't say much [on site], but I would just look at him and know what kind of feelings he wants, and then go with it,"" the actor told CGTN. ""Tseden is a very talented director. Many scenes in 'Balloon' were ideas that he came up with before filming or even on location,"" Sonam Wangmo said of her second team-up with the director.

For her powerful performance as a stressed wife and mother in ""Balloon,"" Wangmo won the best actress award at Hainan Island International Film Festival last year and the film pocketed the best feature.

Human elements lead to global acceptance

""Balloon"" made its global premiere in September at last year's Venice International Film Festival before crossing the Atlantic to take part in Toronto International Film Festival. In both events, it enjoyed great popularity and warm reception. ""What impressed me the most was our global premiere in Venice, during one of their largest screening rooms with 3,000 or 4,000 viewers,"" Tseden recalled. ""Many, especially women, said they could relate on a deep level with the film. They stood up to share their feelings, one after another. Many were touched and cried for Drolkar's dilemma about abortion.""

""The film is for Tibetan people, but I hope it could be viewed by a wider audience beyond the ethnic group, who could receive it and accept it,"" he said, adding, ""Our hope since the beginning was to create a work that transcends regions and nations.""

""The work I filmed doesn't belong to me,"" Jinpa told CGTN. ""A good work belongs to mankind."" Tseden was the first ethnic Tibetan student to be admitted to the prestigious Beijing Film Academy and the first director to film a movie completely in the Tibetan language in China. Five years after ""Tharlo"" caught international attention, the director is now not only a pioneering filmmaker at home but also a leading voice of Tibetan cinema internationally.

The award-winning filmmaker expressed belief that the rise of Tibetan cinema in recent years has a lot more to do than ethnic exoticism, which originates from a questionable but common belief that ""ethnic uniqueness is a ticket to global acceptance"" in movies."
Interview with production team of 'Day Is Done': The power of emotion,"04:28

""A family visit turns into a slow-paced loving farewell between a grandfather and his grandson ¡­ Zhang Dalei's rich cinematic language builds a sensitive family portrait that transcends the duration of the short form,"" said the jury statement in its citation for Chinese short film ""Day Is Done,"" which won the Silver Bear Jury Prize at the 71st Berlin International Film Festival in March.



As one of the world's largest film festivals and also one of the European highlights of the cinema industry calendar, the event, also called Berlinale, was held online this year for the first time due to the coronavirus pandemic. The in-person awards ceremony has been tentatively scheduled for June.



The low-key 2021 Berlinale still offered audiences some impressive productions, of which ""Day Is Done"" is one.

Shared emotion between the East and the West

The story of ""Day Is Done"" happened on a normal afternoon, and it's relatively simple: A boy is about to leave home to study abroad. Before leaving, he visits his grandfather who recalls things from the past. But the film doesn't overplay the sadness of this farewell between loved ones.



""The way of showing emotions (in the Orient) is very restrained. It's cumulative and then explosive,"" the director of ""Day Is Done"" Zhang Dalei told CGTN in an interview. ""Unlike in the West, where people communicate directly, emotions for Oriental people are retained for a long time.""

Quoting from Krzysztof Kieslowski, a director Zhang likes, ""Our race is different, and everyone experiences life differently, the difficulties we meet and our emotional expressions are all the same,"" Zhang talked about how his film resonated with audiences from different countries.



""There are cultural differences,"" Zhang said. ""The differences may be modal and historical, but our emotions are all the same. I think this is one of the reasons why my film was well received by the judges.""



""Deep connections can be made, mainly because we focus on emotions,"" Gao Yitian, the producer of ""Day Is Done"" and director of operations of FIRST International Film Festival, told CGTN during the interview. ""When it comes to emotions, regardless of the country or language barriers, you feel the flow of emotions among people.""

Focus on the new generation of Chinese filmmakers

""Prior to 'Day Is Done' and for many years now, we've had different works shortlisted for the Berlin Film Festival. Different Chinese works of all kinds are selected for international film festivals every year,"" Gao said.

FIRST International Film Festival is about to usher in its 15th year, the young festival has been labeled as arthouse, avant-garde and independent. No one would deny that the festival brings groundbreaking but largely unknown films, including the award-winning ""The Coffin in the Mountain"" and documentary ""Four Springs.""



FIRST International Film Festival focuses more on the new generation of Chinese creators and their productions, most of which involve directorial debuts, according to Gao.

Gao Yitian speaks to CGTN. /CGTN Gao Yitian speaks to CGTN. /CGTN

""We hope that internationally, more people can see the most current and unique talents of every new generation of creators in China, as well as their stories, images, and the expressions of their lives that are born in China,"" he said.



Zhang and Gao both expressed confidence in the future of China's film market and environment. ""Although there are dark times and heavy losses, the recovery is relatively fast,"" said Gao. ""This is a very good era."""
Guan Hu: I'm learning to slow down and find peace in my lows,"04:27

Check any year-end list of 2020's biggest films and you won't miss ""The Eight Hundred."" The Guan Hu-directed war epic was one of the first releases in China after a months-long cinema shutdown because of COVID-19. It scored big on home turf and beyond, raking in a remarkable $468 million to be crowed the No. 1 grossing film of 2020 worldwide. It is the first Chinese-language film to top the global box office, a milestone in an unprecedented era. But for Guan, the hit movie is the realization of a teenage dream to film a war picture after the young man read stories about the Battle of Shanghai in a history book. ""For me, cinema has different functions, like painting and music,"" the 52-year-old veteran filmmaker told CGTN. ""It is a way of life, to ease depression, conquer fear, or fulfill a long-cherished wish, like in the case of 'The Eight Hundred.'"" The $85 million production, based on true events, tells the story of Chinese soldiers defending a warehouse against the invading Japanese army during the Battle of Shanghai in 1937. The title achieved critical and commercial success upon its release on August 21, one month after Chinese cinemas reopened at half-capacity after a six-month lull in operations.

The first major blockbuster of the pandemic era, ""The Eight Hundred"" boosted the recovery of Chinese cinemas, and was credited with the revival of the domestic movie market, which is this year's biggest global box office. Theaters in the country have been operating at a healthy 75% capacity since September. The film's triumph represents a big win for its producers, distributors and Guan himself, who took a risk by releasing the film as the first tentpole to hit cinemas amid the pandemic. The enterprising filmmaker was also among the first to resume work on other movies.

'Relying on creative instinct'

Just two months after the release of ""The Eight Hundred,"" Guan brought to the big screen another war picture, ""The Sacrifice,"" also known as ""Jin Gang Chuan,"" in cooperation with two rising directors Frank Guo (""The Wandering Earth,"" 2019) and Lu Yang (""Brotherhood of Blades,"" 2014).

Director Guan Hu speaks to CGTN /CGTN Director Guan Hu speaks to CGTN /CGTN

The filming of the special effects-driven war picture spotlighting the Chinese People's Volunteers Army began in early August with the three directors working on different parts simultaneously. The movie was released in theaters on October 23 and went on to amass over $171 million, ranking 10th among this year's biggest movies. Noting that the creation course of the film didn't follow the usual rules of production time and techniques, Guan said it was an opportunity to strengthen his will and skills to make ""this miracle."" ""This is an interesting process, during which you are completely relying on your creative instinct,"" he said, adding ""Facing uncertainties and challenges, [you had to] be meticulous about everything.""

Moviemaking needs passion

For the veteran director, working with two other big names on one movie was also a chance to get more inspiration from young talents. ""We are all directors, with different emotions and personalities. So, we could be friends in daily life, but the kind of connection and communication [we had] at work is very rare,"" said Guan of his cooperation with Guo and Lu.

A member of the China Film Director's Guild (CFDG), Guan has been showing support for young filmmakers. He's been on projects by up-and-coming directors, such as ""Reunion Day"" by Gao Linyang, and just last month announced that he will lead the 6th CFDG Young Director Support Program to blaze a trail for young talent. ""Movies belong to young people. Making movies needs passion,"" Guan told CGTN. He expressed the belief that the young generation can be a strong engine in the reboot and recovery of the film industry. ""[Many] have said that the Chinese movie industry has been hit by the COVID-19 pandemic and that we need fresh blood. Haven't they? They refer to this kind of passion,"" he said.

Enjoying peace in highs and lows

Being busy for many years, the filmmaker revealed that he had some restless moments at the beginning of the pandemic when life's pace slowed down. It was an occasion for him to focus on a few small projects that he's been eager to do but had put off for a long time.

"'Stand by me' becomes dark horse, 'Cloudy Mountain' to open","The movie market before the Mid-Autumn Festival is still relatively muted. Despite the release of some new movies, China's box office winner for the week of September 6-12 is still Disney's blockbuster ""Free Guy,"" which crossed 124.67 million yuan ($19.33 million) according to Chinese online movie-ticketing platform Maoyan. After 19 days of its release, ""Free Guy"" has earned a cumulative box office of more than 500 million yuan and a score of 7.8 points out of 10 on Douban, one of the main movie-rating platforms in China. It is well-received as a popcorn movie. ""Free Guy"" is the only Hollywood film to dominate the Chinese box office after the summer break. Released at the end of the summer, it caught the summer holiday as well as the upcoming Mid-Autumn holidays, which gives the film a lot of room to grow at the box office.

In second place was the romance comedy ""Stand by Me,"" which grossed 80 million yuan six days after its release and is very likely to reach the 100 million yuan mark. With its little-known cast and a comparatively small budget, this movie is definitely a box-office dark horse. Before its release, ""Stand by Me"" set off a wave of ""confessions"" on Chinese social networks by virtue of its romantic title. Many netizens expressed their love for their special someone quoting the title of the film. Coming in third with about 63.91 million yuan in ticket sales was ""Raging Fire,"" the final directorial effort by Benny Chan, one of Hong Kong's leading action directors, before his death last August. Sci-fi flick ""The Tomorrow War"" comes in fourth with about 41.14 million yuan while ""Pokemon the Movie: Coco"" followed with 22.02 million yuan.

China's lucrative National Day holiday box office is set to see a star-studded four-part anthology film roughly translated as ""Me and My Father's Generation"" lock horns with the highly-anticipated war film ""The Battle at Lake Changjin.""

The release date of ""Me and My Father's Generation"" has been brought forward by one day to September 30, the last business day before the National Day holiday begins on October 1. The holiday is known as a golden week for major cultural and tourism consumption.

The announcement, made via the official Weibo account of the film on Tuesday, meant ""Me and My Father's Generation"" will have the same release day with ""The Battle at Lake Changjin.""

""Me and My Father's Generation"" is jointly directed by Wu Jing, Zhang Ziyi, Xu Zheng and Shen Teng, all of whom also play the leading roles.

It adopts the storytelling technique of collective creation ¨C one film containing multiple stories by different directors ¨C similar to anthology movies ""My People, My Country"" and ""My People, My Homeland."" The latter two hit theaters around the National Day of 2019 and 2020, respectively, and achieved huge market success.

""The Battle at Lake Changjin"" is jointly helmed by Chen Kaige, Hark Tsui and Dante Lam, all big names in the Chinese film industry. It follows the Chinese People's Volunteers (CPV) in a courageous battle during the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea (1950-1953).

The war film stars Wu Jing and Jackson Yee and tells the story of CPV soldiers fighting bravely in freezing temperatures in a key campaign around Changjin Lake, also known as Chosin Reservoir."
Showtime! A stage actress' Mid-Autumn Festival,"""We have more shows to be staged during the festival,"" the actress explained, adding that the theater where she works is expecting the biggest number of visitors yet after being closed for over 40 days due to the heavy rain and the virus outbreak.

After the deadly floods which struck central China's Zhengzhou in July, followed by a COVID-19 flare-up that shut down parts of this city of 10 million in August, autumn heralds a new beginning for Chen.

""How I'd like to spend this festival? I want to go home, but I can't make it this year,"" Chen told CGTN during an exclusive interview before the festival began.

Home for 22-year-old actress Chen Minghui is 400 kilometers away in north China's Shanxi Province. But for this year, a family reunion will have to be put off.

""I'm excited,"" said Chen without hesitation.

It's the third Mid-Autumn Festival Chen won't spend with her family, but she's committed to her craft.

""I love performing, for no reason, I just love it,"" said the actress, adding that she can't just be an observer.

""If there are people performing on stage, I will definitely join them,"" Chen continued, noting that her mum always supports her, and they can meet after the festival when the work is done.

When the curtain rises, Chen is the ""Silver Butterfly,"" an opera star who sacrifices herself to save the country. A bit of the character's bravery translates to her real life: Chen chooses to take responsibility for her actions.

""I left my hometown and started to work at a younger age,"" Chen recalled. She said she's used to sharing grievances with friends rather than her mum.

""I don't want to worry her,"" the actress whispered. ""She knows I'm well out here, that's all I'm telling her.""

Chen is among 100 of her peers in a troupe working in Jianye movie town. They're her family away from home.

""We perform together, receive flowers and applause together. It makes me happy,"" said the young performer.

As the saying goes, home is where the heart is. And Chen Minghui's heart lies clearly in her craft, and a choice to bring joy to others this festival season.

Rural teacher lights up children's lives with singing,"04:34

Jibu Xiaolong has a full schedule every day. After giving all lessons to students, he continues to coach the members of his choir. Writing songs, playing instruments and teaching his students how to sing, for the 35-year-old teacher, music is an integral part of his life, and it is also changing the children from somewhere once known as one of China's poorest regions in a special way. He describes this a way of realizing the children's dream, but also his own dream. A dream-chaser from mountainous village Xiaolong was born in Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture in southwest China's Sichuan Province, home to the largest population of the Yi ethnic group. For centuries, it was isolated from the world, with all residents struggling in deep poverty. Xiaolong's affection for music started in middle school when he received a guitar from his father as a gift, something deemed as a luxury back then. He was later admitted to the Sichuan Conservatory of Music, a great honor in a place where very few people could receive college education due to poverty. ""But I dared not sing in the beginning, as most of my classmates received professional training during high school and could sing very well. I didn't even know how to do solfeggio and ear training,"" Xiaolong recalled.

Yet his passion has never faded, and he gradually regained confidence as his horizon was broadened in the provincial capital. Following his graduation, he chose to pursue his dream as a singer in different cities, including Beijing, where he participated in some music talent shows and performed part-time in various occasions. It's an adventure full of excitement as well as setbacks. The ambitious young man didn't get many opportunities as expected at a time when young dream seekers were flourishing. He said in the most difficult period of time, he couldn't even afford a guitar worth of 300 yuan ($47). Then he decided to go back home. ""I love singing and playing instruments. I thought it would be great if I could help children in my hometown enjoy music and bring them happiness through singing,"" Xiaolong said. An educator with experience from big cities In 2012, Xiaolong took up work as an elementary school teacher in Liangshan. Apart from music, he also taught other subjects like math as well, a common practice in many rural areas where teachers are scarce. In the first few years, Xiaolong tried to create a children's choir, but his attempts all failed as students were all too shy to sing. ""They even blushed when I talked to them,"" he said.

In 2018, he finally found four children who would like to sing with him at the school he currently works at in Puge County. He also started to write songs on his own, in both Chinese and Yi ethnic language, all focusing on the children's childhood life and beautiful hometown. The melodious works have attracted a growing number of students. Now, the choir named ""Niuniu,"" meaning little girls, have some 40 members. Xiaolong explained that many boys were naughty and felt embarrassed to sing together with girls, and so the group gradually became exclusively for girls. For these students who've never walked out of their mountainous home, music has changed them quite a bit. ""Having stayed in the choir for one and a half years, I'm getting a lot more daring. I was once shy, but now I like to laugh all the time,"" said six-grader Aniu Wuge.

Many of the members are so-called ""left-behind"" children, as their parents seek employment far away from home. For them, music means much more. ""When I miss my parents, I always sing the songs Xiaolong writes for us, especially one called 'Brave Niuniu,' as one line says 'I can look after myself even when mom and dad aren't home,'"" said choir member Asheng Wuzhi. A pathfinder of 'left-behind' children Xiaolong said he felt upset when he just came back and started his teaching career, as what he was still longing for stages to perform. But now, the choir has allowed him to create a close bond with the children, bringing him a sense of accomplishment. ""Sometimes I feel as if they're carrying on my dream. I was pursuing my own dream before, but I feel what I'm doing now is more meaningful, as it allows me to help these children in my own special way,"" he said.

Jibu Xiaolong and his choir members read comments from netizens towards their performance. Yang Jinghao/CGTN Jibu Xiaolong and his choir members read comments from netizens towards their performance. Yang Jinghao/CGTN

He also posts the children's singing at some popular video-sharing platforms like Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok, gaining much popularity. This has brought much confidence to both Xiaolong and the members. Xiaolong is currently trying to seek more performance opportunities for the children in order to expand their horizons and to share the Yi culture with a larger audience. ""If they can take a look at the outside world, they would plant a seed for a better future in their heart and then study harder,"" said Xiaolong. He added that they will not participate in any commercial performances. Earlier this year, they were invited to perform in a music festival in Beijing, but the trip was canceled due to the COVID-19 epidemic, a great disappointment for the girls. ""I hope we can have more opportunities to perform on big stages, really big ones. I really hope I can see more of the world,"" said choir member Axi Wuguo.

'Guochao': China's younger generation embracing domestic brands,"Monday marks China Brand Day. Data shows that Chinese brands are winning increasingly more consumers in recent years, especially among the younger generation. The percentage of keyword searches for Chinese brands surged to more than two thirds among all the searches on Baidu, up from only about one-third 10 years earlier, according to a report jointly released by the search engine and the Research Institute of People.cn.

The trend is usually dubbed ""guochao,"" or ""Chinese fashion trend,"" which has driven demand for domestic brands and products that often incorporate Chinese traditional culture and style. Its main followers are millennials born between 1980-95 and Generation Z born between 1995-2010. Unlike the older generations who could have attachment to Western culture and brands, Chinese youth were born and raised when the country's economy and wealth were taking off, catching up quickly with Western counterparts. The younger generation tends to have strong and genuine confidence in their national identity and traditional culture.

To woo young customers, these domestic names are making products with high quality and appeal by strengthening research and marketing efforts. An often-cited case is Li-Ning, China's homegrown sportswear brand that is named after one of the nation's most famous athletes. The company almost met its demise after a failed rebranding in 2011 ¨C when it went through three consecutive years of losses after losing older customers while failing to attract younger buyers. Then by restructuring its business, clearing out inventory built up, closing underperforming stores and resorting to e-commerce, Li-Ning made a small profit in 2015. It was not until the 2018 New York Fashion Week that the brand made its huge comeback. Its trendy look, bold use of color, and embedded traditional Chinese culture elements showcased on the stage, that it immediately grabbed attention at home and abroad.

Last month, Li Ning even saw its sales on e-commerce platform Tmall surge by more than 800 percent, amid a slump in the popularity of Western brands that boycotted Xinjiang cotton citing ""forced labor"" allegations. Read more: Adidas, Nike web sales in China plunge amid boycott The trend to embrace domestic brands has spread rapidly to various sectors and products as well, from food and drinks (Three Squirrels, Hey Tea) to clothing (Ubras, Bosideng), mobile phones (Huawei, Xiaomi, Oppo) and electronic vehicles (Nio, XPeng). Market share of Chinese brands has reached 72 percent in 2019 on Alibaba's retail platforms, data from China's e-commerce giant shows.

Many decade-old brands have reinvigorated themselves and made tremendous progress in connecting with young markets. For example, one of China's oldest liquor maker Luzhou Laojiao launched a perfume; White Rabbit candy, the milk-flavored chewy sweet that easily evokes Chinese's childhood memories, launched a lip balm in with Maxam, a local cosmetics company. Their sales were then boosted by innovative marketing and sales tactics.

Pechoin, a Shanghai skincare brand founded in 1931, employed a variety of promotional strategies on digital channels to revamp its image, including game sponsorships, celebrity endorsements that enjoys a huge Generation Z fan base, co-branding, social-media campaigns and online promotions. It launched a mobile ad in 2017 that swept the whole country, which staged an elegant Shanghainese female spy on a secret mission in 1931. It has since consolidated the leading share in China's skincare market. There has also been a shift to invite online influencers to attract new audiences and consumers. Established in 2017, Florasis soon became one of the top new Chinese beauty brands, largely due to its collaboration with top livestreamer Li Jiaqi to promote its products. Data shows that from January to February 2020, 80 percent of Florasis' revenue came from online sales ¨C half of which came directly from Li's livestream sessions. Read more: China's top beauty influencer Li Jiaqi: No makeup when I am offline While many Chinese brands have been gaining significant market share at home in recent years, others are posting an increasingly stronger global presence. In 2020, China's tech giant Xiaomi reported its most profitable year on the back of expanded sales and global market share. Revenues from Haier Smart Home's overseas business last year also marked an all-time high of 100 billion yuan ($15.5 billion), cementing the top position in global market share for major home appliances. But most of the brands still face plenty of challenges ahead to meet the sophisticated needs of customers and regulators in overseas markets; even geopolitical risks may stand in the way."

""My illustration ""Cute Island"" that depicted my trip to South Korea's Jeju Island was selected for the 2019 edition. And later that year, when I went to Italy to claim the award, I visited Rome, Florence and Bologna. Inspired by local art museums, architecture and even street scenes, I painted ""A Travel"" which was selected for the 2020 edition,"" said Wu.

Launched by the Bologna Children's Book Fair in 1967, the Bologna Illustrators Exhibition also introduces the latest trends in illustration. Since its debut in China in 2016, the event has attracted both artists and enthusiasts from across the country.

Blooming Chinese finery: International clothing fair in Dalian,"2021 China (Dalian) International Garment & Textile Fair, CIGF 2021, kicked off in the city of Dalian on September 10, with ""Blooming Clothes"" as its theme.

The three-day fair focused on the garment industry in northeastern China, leading the fashion in the coming seasons.

Domestic designs were definitely in the spotlight. More than 450 domestic brands participated, accounting for 75 percent of the total. In the exhibition area of the brand ""TRANDS,"" the focus was on the ""Guochao"" series of Chinoiserie couture suits. Dayang Group, its owner, is a leader in China's textile and garment industry, which is renowned for its suit-making expertise.

Hu Dongmei, general manager of Dayang Group, said they launched their innovative products involving intangible cultural heritage in their ""Guochao"" series. They added Chinese elements such as Suzhou embroidery into their suits. The combination of Chinese and Western, classical and innovative, resonated with the aesthetics of the young generation.

There was plenty of focus too on various independent fashion designers' works and a wedding dress exhibition. Many renowned designers as well as emerging designers still in fashion colleges and universities in northeast China presented diverse designs. The Dalian Cup International Youth Fashion Design Contest was also held for young designers during the fair.

Xi Jinping sends greetings to teachers ahead of Teachers' Day,"Chinese President Xi Jinping has called on teachers to provide good guidance to students in a greeting to educators across the country ahead of China's Teachers' Day, which falls on Friday.



Xi, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission, made the remarks on Wednesday in a letter to representatives of model teaching units named after late geophysicist at Jilin University Huang Danian, who helped China make advances in deep earth exploration.



Xi praised the representatives for their achievements in teaching and scientific research and innovation, noting that they have followed Huang's example in their work.



He encouraged them and college teachers across China to provide good guidance to students and make new contributions to the cause of fully building a modern socialist country.



Huang, known for his expertise in deep earth exploration technology, studied and worked in Britain for 18 years before returning to China in 2009. Over the ensuing years, he helped China soar in a number of technical fields, transforming the nation into a world leader in deep earth exploration. He died in January 2017 at the age of 58.



Xi called on the whole society to learn from the late geophysicist and hailed his outstanding contributions in education and scientific research in a written instruction in May 2017.



The Ministry of Education launched a nationwide campaign in colleges and universities in 2017 to form model teaching units named after Huang. The first batch of 201 teaching units from 200 colleges and universities was identified in the campaign.



The representatives of these teaching units wrote a letter to Xi recently about their work and expressed determination to contribute to China's national rejuvenation.

China strengthens crackdown on irregular off-campus tutoring,"China has pledged stern actions against irregular off-campus tutoring activities featuring curriculum subjects.

Unlicensed institutions and individuals offering backdoor curriculum subject-tutoring services, such as household services and consulting, will be investigated and handled in accordance with the related law and regulations, according to a circular issued by the Ministry of Education on Wednesday.

The document also clarifies other types of irregularities in off-campus curriculum subject-tutoring activities, including those violating regulations on who can provide such services as well as when, where and how such services can be provided.

Meanwhile, primary and secondary school teachers are banned from being paid for offering extra lessons after class, the circular says.

It also bans conducting tutoring of core school subjects under the disguise of summer camps or training of art, sports, science and technology, adding that offline institutions cannot provide such services through online channels, such as livestreaming and online conferencing.

China's Ministry of Education (MOE) on Friday asked schools to strengthen health monitoring of their students and faculty members before the beginning of the fall semester.

Schools are not permitted to begin classes if they fail to meet local COVID-19 control standards or if they are not fully prepared for an emergency, the ministry said at a press conference.

Schools in areas that are at high or medium risk for COVID-19 should postpone the start of the new semester.

Students and teachers who have been to high- or medium-risk areas should delay their return to school, the MOE said.

Students, faculty members and other staff of higher education institutions are required to show negative results of nucleic acid tests taken within 48 hours of their return from vacation, it said.

A COVID-19 control plan for schools that was recently issued by the MOE and the National Health Commission has required students at higher education institutions to wear masks on campus.

Primary and middle school students in low-risk areas and children in kindergartens do not have to wear masks in class, the document said."

News and rumors about the education arm of TikTok owner ByteDance going through a major human resources quake went viral online on Thursday. Formed in October 2020, the newcomer in the educational tech sector, Dali Education, was just about to ride the tide of China's private education business boom in recent years. In February this year, it announced its plan to hire some 13,000 employees as part of its ambition to build up an education business empire. Many of its employees were fresh graduates from universities. The expansion has come to an abrupt halt shortly after the authorities issued a guidance in late July to ban listed companies to run school curriculum tutoring services, a move the government said was aimed at reducing burdens of students and preventing education from being ""hijacked by capitals."" According to sources close to Dali, though rumors about a full layoff of all employees are not true, the company did let go an undisclosed number of people. Some people were transferred to other teams. Known as an international learning platform with only North American teachers, online education company VIPKid on Saturday said on its WeChat account that it will not provide learning products involving foreign teachers, echoing the government's recent policy to cut student's burdens. The policy clearly forbids foreign teachers from teaching outside the country. VIPKid said it will soon launch lessons for adults and lessons on traditional culture, and its international business will not be affected. Gogokid, a sub-brand under Dali that operates online English teaching and also claims all of its teachers are from North America, said in a message on its website that it would end all its streaming lessons from August 5. More education companies have been dealt a blow following the release of the new rules. Two U.S.-listed Chinese educational tech companies, New Oriental and TAL Education, after a heavy stock plunge of over 70 percent, on Monday canceled their scheduled release of the quarterly financial results for the three months ended June 30, amid the recent regulatory action.

Established in 1993 and listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in 2006, New Oriental is the largest private education service provider in China. It is known for language training and test preparation. As of May 31, 2020, New Oriental has set up 104 schools, 1,361 learning centers, and 12 bookstores in 91 cities across the country. TAL, formerly known as Xueersi, which was founded in 2003 and listed on the NYSE in 2010, had set up 990 teaching centers in 102 cities by the end of November 2020, according to its website. Many other companies engaged in English, math and Chinese private tutoring have been reportedly planning or already starting to lay off people or restructure their teaching programs and human resources. Observers say the authorities have been determined to sort out the long-debated after-school education sector, as many have been complaining about the draining of high-quality teachers from schools to the high-paying tutoring companies, and the increasing cost of time and money outside school. It is time for the tutoring firms to rethink their business model and restructure their teaching programs if they want to survive in the tutoring business, analysts said. Sudden blow The regulation released on July 24 will ban private institutions that teach school subjects from raising capital from the stock markets, providing tutoring on weekends and holidays, or providing foreign curricula. It also forbids listed companies or foreign companies to invest in such tutoring services. While no new such services will be allowed to register, the existing ones will be turned into ""non-profit institutions,"" according to the regulation. ""It is devastating for the whole training industries, including online and offline training, because classes are not allowed on weekends, during winter and summer breaks,"" Helen Li, a teacher from online education startup Zuoyebang, told CGTN. Li said the regulations are very detailed. Students can only have after-school classes before 21:00 from Monday to Friday. Many parents who send their children to such classes during the weekends are unwilling to adjust accordingly, some may probably withdraw, Li said.

Parents are having mixed feelings when they heard the news. Many of them send their children to private tutoring just for fear of being left behind by other students who already attend such classes. The students who obtained an edge from off-campus tutorship are often in a better position to be admitted by more prestigious high schools. ""We can take a relaxing breath amid the fierce tutoring campaign, which is a good thing,"" said a father with a 6-year-old son, who preferred to only use his surname Wang in the article. But he said he's still worried, ""I'm not sure if other parents have some other ways to get their children tutored."" There are indeed some parents who embrace off-campus training. ""Most parents have clear goals. They want their children to get into a good college, so they are willing to get their children tutored,"" Adele Liu, a high school-curriculum teacher from New Oriental said. Liu said the high school teaching team at the company has not been affected so far. Meanwhile, reactions vary from first-tier cities to small cities, as some large cities like Beijing and Shanghai serve as pilot cities in the rectification. Some small cities are still watching. Restructuring and layoffs ""Almost all tutoring companies are cutting off employees, some are even cutting about 70 percent of the total,"" Li said. Zhang Bangxin, the co-founder and chairman of TAL Education, said layoffs are inevitable at an internal meeting on July 27, when talks of the government's major overhaul of this industry have been running hot. ""Businesses that are not in demand will definitely be shut down. Employees in the corresponding business can be transferred internally first. If they cannot be transferred, we will pay compensation per national laws,"" Zhang said, Caijing magazine's LatePost reported. Chen Xiangdong, the co-founder and chairman of Beijing-based online tutoring service provider Gaotu Techedu also said the company has to cut employees. But it is also a process of restructuring. ""A large number of sales positions will be abolished. But those teachers in the teaching system will be retained. It can be said that the teachers left are outstanding. In this sense, our ability has been improved rather than degraded,"" Chen said in an interview with the 21st Century Business Herald. Transformation is a must-do, but the plan is not that clear. ""If you want to survive, transformation is a must. We may try many things, including shifting to the non-academic subjects like artificial intelligence (AI) lesson, or recording some lessons for students to take,"" Li said.

During this period, coastal areas are more prone to natural calamities like typhoons, while some regions are more likely to reel under drought-like situations as many others face an increased risk of flooding and erosion. But abundant sunshine and rainfall also spells a boost for the forthcoming harvest. For farmers living in southern China, it is a crucial time for gathering their ripe crops from the field, beginning another round of direct seeding and transplanting rice seedlings.

Best foods to keep cool this summer!

It is vital to make necessary dietary changes according to the season, especially during the ""dog days"" when you easily feel lethargic and struggle with lack of concentration at work as hot and humid weather causes loss of appetite and sleeping disorders.

Extreme heatwave can pose serious heath risks including dehydration, skin sensitivities, fever and heat stroke. During Major Heat, your body needs foods that contain more water to replenish the fluids lost from sweating. Juicy fruits and vegetables such as strawberries, orange, grapes, melons, cucumber and leafy greens like Chinese cabbage score highly in this regard.

Foods with mild and gentle tastes like pumpkin and honey are great appetite boosters, which also help nourish our heat-stricken digestive system. Litchi, full of glucose and vitamins, is a popular choice. According to Traditional Chinese Medicine, eating litchi during this period is as nourishing as eating ginseng ¨C a herbal supplement that is often regarded as the king of all herbs. Drinking some tea and eating cool desserts, prepared using natural ingredients such as herbs, fruit, and flowers, can help your body cool off and avoid heat-related health issues.

Grass jelly is a black jelly-like substance that has a mild and slightly bitter taste. It can also relieve a burned tongue and heal a sore throat. It derives from Platostoma palustre plant ¨C a member of the mint family that is also known as ""Chinese mesona"" ¨C and is overwhelmingly popular in southern China, such as in Fujian, Guangdong and Taiwan.

Hailed as divine grass, or ""Xiancao"" in Chinese, grass jelly is found to be a promising agent to promote digestive health and improve general well being as it has high water and fiber content and chock-full of beneficial nutrients, including vitamin A and C, carbohydrates, and chlorophyll compounds. Offering a wealth of health benefits, it is also deliciously refreshing. Often times served chilled, grass jelly tastes good when it is mixed with other toppings like apricot, raisins, and crushed peanuts. A cooling sweet treat featuring grass jelly as well as the above-mentioned ingredients including pumpkin and honey is a must-try in peak summer.

Minor heat: A sweet treat for an appetizing summer,"02:27

Minor heat, the 11th of the 24 solar terms on the Chinese lunar calendar, indicates that the hottest period is on its way, with the ¡°dog days¡± yet to arrive.

Rain, thunder, and hail

As the name indicates, ¡°heat¡± is definitely the most significant feeling during this period of time. Across China, the temperature will surge as high as 40 degrees Celsius, especially in cities known as China's furnaces like Nanjing, Wuhan, Chongqing and Nanchang. Besides the rising temperature, rain, along with thunder and hail, will also come in spades. Thus, during this period of time, flood control and drought relief are the primary focus in farming.

According to Chinese folklore, there was a little white dragon who was imprisoned far away by his father for breaking the law of heaven. On this day of minor heat every year, the Dragon King granted permission for the little white dragon to visit his mother. The little white dragon flew all the way back home to his mother day and night, brought thunder and rain along the way. Usually after rains and storms, a clear sky emerges with plenty of sunshine, so the dragon robes were taken out of the Dragon Palace and dried under the sun. So many families often choose this day to hang clothes and bedding in the sunny weather to remove dampness.

Sweet appetizer

When summer hits, people lose their appetites, but some refreshing sweet dishes stimulate the appetite during the summer. Many kinds of melons are harvested during the summer, especially watermelon, which is definitely a seasonal favorite.

Lotus blossom during the summer. /VCG Photo Lotus blossom during the summer. /VCG Photo

Besides melons, lotus roots are also great for cooking. In the summer, the lotus fully blossoms, while its roots are fresh and tender. Poetic Chinese not only appreciate the beauty of the lotus, but also make its root into appetizers. According to traditional Chinese medicine, people believe that the lotus root can clear the lungs and relieve heat, so dishes cooked with lotus roots are highly recommended by doctors. ¡°Lotus Root Stuffed with Steamed Sticky Rice¡± is one of the most popular dishes. Prepared a pot of boiled water colored with red yeast rice, add cube sugar and malt syrup for a sticky texture. Fill up the lotus root with sticky rice and fix it with toothpicks. Cook the lotus root for about three hours. Cut the lotus root into slices and drizzle the lotus root slices with osmanthus honey and sprinkle the dry osmanthus onto it. A good-looking and delicious summer snack is ready to be enjoyed."
Summer Solstice: Enjoy cold noodles in the heat of summer,"The sweaty days of summer come after the day of Summer Solstice, which starts on June 21 this year.

The Summer Solstice, or Xiazhi in Chinese, begins when the sun reaches the celestial longitude of 90 degrees. This is also when the Northern Hemisphere sees the longest day and the shortest night of the year.

For each of the 24 solar terms divided by the Chinese lunar calendar, there are representative foods. For Summer Solstice, the day would be incomplete without noodles.

Taking the temperature into consideration, a bowl of Chinese cold noodles is an indisputable choice for dinner."
Tomb of Nanyue King: Discovering precious items and imported goods,"04:19

As a person who grew up in northern China, my impression towards Guangzhou City, one of the largest southeast cities in China, was all from internet and weather reports. Hot and humid, it is the typical description for coastal cities in China, including Guangzhou. Guangzhou is the birthplace for the ancient maritime silk route, connecting China with foreign countries by ships. In the past, Guangzhou was called Panyu, the capital of Nanyue Kingdom.

In contrast to other tombs located far from the city center, the Nanyue King tomb was discovered in downtown Guangzhou in 1983. The Nanyue King museum, which houses the tomb, was built in the same location next to a busy street. This tomb from the Han Dynasty is the oldest and largest Han tomb with the most burial objects in Lingnan (South of the Nanling Mountain).

The Nanyue King tomb belonged to the second king of Nanyue, Zhao Mo, who ruled from 137 BC to 122 BC. Compared to other luxury tombs, the Nanyue King tomb unearthed more than 1,000 burial objects; many of them rare treasures with exotic cultural characteristics.

The administrative seal of emperor Wen is one of such rare items. Emperor seals are typically made from jade and are large and heavy. The tiny, but delicate, seal is made from pure gold. It was the earliest seal with dragon a knob found. A lot of the relics can be traced back to foreign countries of that time. The patterns on ornaments have the strong characteristics of Mesopotamian culture. Even at that time, people had the concept of combining exotic foreign styles with local culture.

The Tomb of Nanyue King of Western Han Dynasty unveiled the impact of the ancient maritime silk route. All the burial objects are extremely rare and precious, which combine culture from different regions and countries. Whether as Panyu in ancient past or as Guangzhou in today's world, this city located near the sea has greatly taken advantage of its geographical location by building international networks throughout time."
Sanxingdui Site: A mysterious costume party with masks from the past,"""Are they aliens?"" ¨C That was my first impression when I saw weird masks of different sizes floating in a big display room at Sanxingdui Museum in southwest China's Sichuan Province. Their ears resembled those of elves, their eyes in cylindrical or triangular shapes.

Sanxingdui translates into ""Three-Star Piles."" It is a cultural relic from the ancient Shu Kingdom. The name refers to the three earth mounds at the eponymous site, whose discovery attracted international attention and rewrote the history of Chinese civilization.

These masks were unearthed from sacrificial pits, were archaeologists also found decorative animals including dragons and snakes, a giant wand, and sacrificial altars.

But these large bronze masks with angular human features, including exaggerated triangle-shaped eyes, big noses, and huge ears, do not reflect how Asian people look."
An ancient 'slash worker': Marquis Yi of Zeng and his alter ego,"04:54

The clanging sound of swords clashing was not music to the ears of a Chinese king during the Warring States period (475 B.C. ¨C 221 B.C.). At a time of bloodshed and violence, Marquis Yi of Zeng found peace in the gentle ring of chimes. New York Times author Marci Alboher coined the term ""slash career"" to describe the people in modern time who have a steady income from different careers. In central China's Hubei Province, I came across arguably the oldest ""slash worker"" who lived during the Warring States period. He is thought to be a king of one of the states at war. His tomb, discovered in Suizhou City of central China's Hubei Province in 1978, is noteworthy because it was built using thick tree trunks. Each burial chamber is square-shaped.

When the tomb was excavated, a number of coffins were found floating in underground water. One coffin housed the remains of a male in his mid-forties. It was that of Marquis Yi of Zeng. The remaining 21 caskets all belonged to women, aged between 13 and 25. Once the water was drained, an astonishing collection of musical instruments revealed itself to the world. The most famous one is a giant chime, which weighs nearly five tons. It is a percussion instrument, called ""bianzhong"" or ""chime bells,"" consisting of a set of bronze bells of different sizes and pitch sequences. It's the best preserved chime set, with the most bells. Among the 21 buried women, eight were in the same chamber with the owner, so experts believe they were his wives. The other 13 were found in a separate chamber next to the instruments and are believed to be musicians.

Historical records show that Marquis Yi of Zeng was into making musical instruments and researching about music ¡ª a musician of sorts. I got the chance to play a replica of the instrument at Hubei Provincial Museum. Each bell can make two different sounds when tapped in different locations. I somehow managed to play ""Ode of Joy"" with the 2,400-year-old instrument. In the tomb, archaeologists also discovered a considerable number of ritual and drinking vessels. They are the most refined I have ever seen during any of my archaeological trips. Their peculiar shapes, perfect craftsmanship, and gorgeous decoration showed advanced smelting techniques at such an early time.

Half of the burial objects were weapons, and the expansive collection of rare weapon types suggests that Marquis Yi of Zeng was a great strategist as well. Living in an era when wars were a daily occurrence, Marquis Yi of Zeng seemed to have found peace in diversifying his interests, switching between a strategist and a musician."

"No game, no life: A young woman's trailblazing entrepreneurship","05:29

""Life is like a game of chess, where every move you make has an impact on the rest of your game,"" Kathy Gong Xiaosi said, looking radiant. Sitting in the open area outside her office in downtown Beijing, Gong, once the youngest national chess champion, recounted how her third startup survived a near collapse. Called Wafa Games, her company uses cutting-edge tech to create fun and dignified gaming experiences. Venturing into the gaming industry requires massive investments and courage to withstand the risk of bankruptcy. But Gong chose to go against the grain. The 35-year-old woman from the southwestern city of Chengdu founded the company in 2017 with a partner she got to know through playing games. ""I'm a gamer, but I found most games boring or even disagreeable since female characters are designed mainly to appeal to male players, with scant clothing and sexualized bodies."" For decades, most video games around the world have portrayed female characters as manifestations of male fantasies with hourglass curves and skinny waists. In hot pants or tiny skirts, they prance around to help, support and take care of their male teammates. Either that or they are framed as ditzy love interests needing to be rescued. Gong developed her deep affection for games during a lonely period while studying in New York, so she decided to fight against this stereotype by creating well-rounded female protagonists, especially for women gamers like her. ""I like hardcore games where you use strategic thinking as you do on the chessboard,"" she said. Female gamers are on the rise, accounting for nearly half of gamers worldwide. In China and the U.S. ¨C the world's two biggest gaming markets ¨C women made up about 48 percent (according to the China Gamers Report) and 41 percent (according to Statista) of gamers respectively in 2020. The female-to-male proportion is even higher when it comes to the mobile gaming market, at 63 percent female and 37 percent male. Women players are fond of a variety of games from adventure to action to strategy, plot-heavy and story-driven, but it can be difficult for them to find elements they relate to.

A gamer, a woman, an entrepreneur The gaming industry is hyper-casual, which makes it difficult to anticipate customer demand and predict what's going to be popular next year. Getting VC funding for a gaming startup is tough. Moreover, a team with well-rounded expertise, cohesion and gender conscience is usually an outlier. For such a startup led by a woman, things get even more complicated. Gong noted that fewer than one in 1,000 female entrepreneurs in the industry have ever gotten early-stage investment. She had to go the extra mile to get things done. Most of the time when she met with investors, they'd ask, ""How do you lead a game company as a woman?"" She was repeatedly told to make people forget as much as possible that she's a woman. Like in most other sectors, women in power are still subordinate to their male counterparts. On the executive board of the top 14 global gaming companies, only 16 percent are women, according to a Forbes study in 2020. The proportion is equally dire out of the C-Suite: Women make up merely 24 percent of employees engaged in game development. In addition, they frequently face discrimination, and receive lower pay than their male counterparts. Most games are created by men, for men. Female representation in both the real world and the make-believe universe is far from fair. ""Gaming needs diversity. I want to make something different,"" Gong said. The way to trailblaze in this boys-only club is rough and checkered. ""Like playing chess, one move is all it takes for your game to fall apart."" In 2019, Wafa Games had a serious problem with cash flow. She sent emails in a frenzy to possible investors, looking for a way out. ""Every day when I walked home, tears just streamed down my face. I ran every day, for 10 kilometers. After that I felt I was reborn. It's just like playing chess: How can you surrender when you are not yet checkmated?""

No checkmate When Gong was little, her father gave up his stable job at an ordnance factory in Huaying Mountains, and her mother, a doctor, quit to help with her father's endeavor. They moved to the nearby city of Chengdu and started a business amidst the tide of reform and opening-up. It was exciting but daunting. The family lived in a rental home, too small to house a wardrobe. And it was hard to find a proper school for Gong since many teachers thought ""a rural kid"" would be a drag on the class. ""I felt inferior in that big city."" One day, she was diagnosed with autism. ""I don't know when it started and don't know whether I've ever recovered."" ""Back then, my mother took me to dancing class, but I wasn't into it,"" Gong recalled. ""One day I saw in an opposite classroom a teacher instructing children how to play chess. That piqued my interest. It was amazing to move the pieces on the glittering chessboard."" Since then, she has been obsessed with chess. ""My father told me every move had a price. At around 9 or 10, I was traveling around the country to participate in chess competitions. He made me do the math by adding up the costs of train tickets, hotels and registration fee, and then calculate how much each move would cost."" Training and practicing day and night paid off. She became the youngest national champion in China's history at the age of 8 and repeated the feat five years later. With such an impressive accomplishment, she was sent to compete in a dozen international tournaments on behalf of China.

A young championship helped Gong deal with her autism, won her a full scholarship to Columbia University, and most importantly, gave her the ability to manage emotions ¨C a crucial element in entrepreneurship. ""Victory is important. Failure is just as important. They both help improve my skills, temper my will, and make me stronger."" Before Wafa Games, Gong founded two startups. The first was called PPoint, an instant messenger for cross-border business negotiation software, which, however, broke by the ninth month before the product came out. She then started a second firm ¨C ai.Law ¨C a robotics company providing affordable legal services in divorce and immigration. For instance, it cost only 1 yuan ($0.15) for one consultation session in a divorce case. To Gong's surprise, 67 percent of the APP's 6 million users were women, many of whom were seeking a divorce from an abusive relationship. During those early years of entrepreneurship, every day was a thrilling yet indulgent excursion. Hardships couldn't derail her. ""You may run out of money, half of your employees quit, and your product even has no potential, but as long as your will does not collapse, there is hope.""

Inspiring through gaming Gong took away important lessons on gender disparities from the user profiles during her experience with ai.Law. She addresses some of them in her latest startup, such as reshaping female characters into warriors. ""In the Middle Ages, there were female generals commanding soldiers on the battlefield. They were brave, resolute, audacious,"" Gong exclaimed. She and her team explored powerful women in history to put in their game. ""We have a female character called Shajar al-Durr, reputed to be the first female Muslim Sultan during the time of the Crusades, which were pretty much a medieval world war. Born a slave, she ascended to the throne, becoming the first woman to rule Egypt since Cleopatra,"" Gong said excitedly when explaining the characters in their game ""Swords of Glory."" In the Middle Ages, a proliferation of women held ruling positions or worked as political elites. Another female protagonist was Eleanor of Aquitaine, one of the most powerful and wealthy women in medieval Europe. She was married to the king of France and then the king of England when divorce was taboo. Historians today are still obsessed with exploring the legend of her life.

While promoting gender diversity through game design, Gong calls for unity among young people from all backgrounds, not just between men and women. Now that 80 percent of millennials and Gen Zers play video games, she thinks it's important to have the younger generations use games for more than play. ""In our game, for example, we have many Muslim players and Christian players. In the real world they might start a fight when they meet, but in the game world they might be brothers."" Now Wafa Games has over 1 million gamers worldwide, 40 percent of whom are women. For her breakthroughs in game AI and related algorithms as well as her effort to promote digital dignity, Gong was named one of the 35 innovators under the age of 35 by MIT Technology Review.

Nobel Laureate Mo Yan reveals secret behind his powerful storytelling,"06:35

Nine years after receiving the Nobel Prize in Literature, Mo Yan, 66, shows no sign of letting up in his pursuit of crafting great stories, remaining a passionate storyteller as energetic as he was three decades ago. As one of China's most accomplished contemporary writers, Mo Yan has generated tons of novels that are widely published and have won him multiple honors and awards both at home and abroad. But he achieved celebrity status largely thanks to the stunning success of the eponymous film adaption of his romantic novel Red Sorghum, which was first published in 1986. The acclaimed director Zhang Yimou made a visually striking movie out of the writer's cinematic and suspenseful grand narrative. The film was a huge hit at the box office. It also won the Golden Bear at the 1988 Berlin International Film Festival.

02:07

Since the late 1980s, Mo Yan has deviated from mainstream Chinese literature and created a style to call his own. The Nobel Committee for Literature praised him as the one ""who with hallucinatory realism merges folk tales, history and the contemporary."" Although Mo Yan acknowledges that Garcia Marquez's magic realism style inspired his writing in some way, he insists that he is trudging on a path independent from Marquez. Mo Yan, pseudonym of Guan Moye, was born in 1955 in a small village in east China's Shandong Province. His rural hometown has been the fictionalized setting for most of his stories.

The childhood home of Chinese writer Mo Yan in Gaomi County, east China's Shandong Province, April 2, 2018. /CFP The childhood home of Chinese writer Mo Yan in Gaomi County, east China's Shandong Province, April 2, 2018. /CFP

""I am deeply nourished by folk literature,"" Mo Yan told CGTN, ""I dropped out of school at the fifth grade. After that, I worked with my uncles to do farm work for many years. While my peers were reading with their eyes, I was reading with my ears. I listened to the stories of gods and ghosts, historical legends, and anecdotes told by adults."" And his works have drawn on traditional Chinese folk tales. With a mix of realism and surrealism, Mo Yan's stories are meant to take a harsh look at the dark side of life, with an unflinching dissection of humanity. He told CGTN that he was ""writing as if he himself is the sinner"" when working on his most recent novel Frog, first published in 2009. ""A writer must turn his vision and eyes inward and look at his own heart,"" he said. Apart from his surreal plots, the dimensions Mo Yan gives to his female protagonist are also hard to ignore. The male writer who once admitted he was a feminist during a magazine interview, has created numerous headstrong and rebellious female characters, such as Shangguan Lu in his epic novel Big Breasts & Wide Hips and Dai Fenglian in Red Sorghum Family. Big Breasts & Wide Hips, a story about a mom and her eight daughters, is considered a tribute to the strong females in China.

02:38

Mo Yan laments the miserable destiny of Chinese women in the feudal society, and the female characters in his works stand up against oppression and fight for a way out of despair. ""They rebelled against the feudal system physically. Their body was the only thing they had power over,"" he said. Mo Yan is a keen worshipper of maternal love, so much so that he believes motherhood defines part of a woman's identity. He recounted an encounter with a mother of twins, and the stark contrast between the mom's weary look and her twins' rosy cheeks moved him deeply. ""The sun was setting, and the afterglow beamed down on them. I felt as if I was looking at a sacred picture."" Kjell Espmark, former chairman of the Nobel Committee for Literature, once said that he believed in Mo Yan's capability in continuously writing great stories even after winning the Nobel Prize.

00:54

Mo Yan surely never let people down when it comes to his writing. His latest book A Late Bloomer, a collection of 12 novellas, has won critical acclaim, and people are expecting more from him. During the interview, Mo revealed that his next novel takes on quite a grand theme, and he is still polishing it, without disclosing any further details. Mo Yan said he will keep writing as long as he can. ""Only when I am writing, can I feel the worth and meaning of my life,"" he said."

Brunei actor-singer Wu Chun receives Chinese-made coronavirus vaccines,"02:27

100,000 Sinopharm vaccine doses contributed by the Chinese government arrived in Brunei a few days ago. Writing on social media, the Brunei actor and singer Wu Chun celebrated the delivery and announced that he had received the vaccine. During an exclusive interview with CGTN's reporter You Yang, Wu shared about his vaccination experience.

""I received the vaccine at a hospital in Brunei. There are many different coronavirus vaccines on the market here in Brunei. I did a lot of research on the vaccines, because I wanted to take my family to get the shot with me. I think safety is very important. Finally we decided to take Chinese-made vaccines because we trust them and we think these vaccines are more suitable for us,"" said Wu.

This latest contribution represents the second batch of vaccines that Brunei received from China. The first batch of vaccines consisting 52,000 doses of Sinopharm were received in February. ""I've worked in China for over 10 years. So I am learning more and more about China. And I also took my family to China. During these years, we have seen the fast development of China's medical science and technology. And we have also consulted many of our friends about China's vaccines, so I have a lot of confidence in them, ""said Wu when asked why Chinese-made coronavirus vaccines are trustworthy.

Since 2020, Brunei and China have extended mutual assistance in addressing the COVID-19. Brunei provided financial assistance to help China manage the impact of the coronavirus in March 2020. ""A lot of my friends asked me how I felt about getting a Chinese-made vaccine. And I will tell you that earlier this year, because the first batch of Chinese-made vaccine was used up here in Brunei, there is a video showing an old lady who was upset that she couldn't get it. She said in the video 'I don't want to use other kinds of vaccines'. That video soon became quite popular here, so you can see there are a lot of people in Brunei who trust Chinese vaccines,"" Wu added.

A nationwide campaign was launched shortly after a famous actress made the headlines with a fine of $46 million for evading taxes. Zheng Shuang failed to declare 191-million-yuan worth of personal income earned over the past two years and had evaded taxes worth 45.27 million yuan. She was also found to have underpaid her taxes by 26.52 million yuan.

The State Taxation Administration issued a notice and required celebrities to pay up taxes by self-declaration before the end of 2021. Reminding the celebrities of regularly examining their tax records, the notice said one-to-one risk reminders will be issued for those with tax-related risks based on the situation of individual income tax settlement and the payment made in 2020.

Those who voluntarily report and promptly rectify tax-related problems before the end of 2021 may be exempted or given lighter or mitigated punishment.

Anyone who refuses to cooperate with the tax authorities' investigation and verification and supervision of rectification shall be ordered to rectify their behaviors in accordance with the law, and the competent authorities and associations in the industry shall be asked to assist in the supervision and correction; if the circumstances are serious, they shall be investigated and dealt with strictly in accordance with the law.

In the past, in order to attract investment and play a star effect, some places have loosely regulated the enjoyment of preferential tax policies in the entertainment industry, and even introduced some illegal ""local policies"" such as tax refunds.

Many celebrities set up shell companies in tax havens such as Khorgos in northwest China's Xinjiang thus enjoying tax incentives and financial rebates in disguise. In the future, supervision in this area will continue to be strengthened, as will compliance with the principle of substantive operation, and the review process will be more stringent, so as to prevent the shell companies established by celebrities from enjoying preferential policies that should not be obtained."

The final 24 candidates assembled in Beijing's Shougang Park and the National Winter Training Center Ice Hockey Hall on Friday to prepare to set off for the cities of Xi'an, Wuhan, Shanghai or Yunnan, continuing to the final stage of the competition by participating in a reality TV show. ""The Media Challengers"" recruitment process began on April 8, 2021, with the goal of recruiting talented new media professionals worldwide and introduce new ideas into international communication in the context of media convergence. It was a rigorous process that set a high standard for entrants to prove qualified to be a CGTN global host, reporter or internet celebrity. Thirty professional reviewers, including experts and scholars in the media field, well-known media agency executives, well-loved opinion leaders and industry leaders, provided authoritative and professional coverage for this recruitment campaign.

The online ""Like"" vote-gathering activities also fully demonstrated the participants' appeal to fans in the new media era. The 24 finalists were all chosen based on scores counted from a combination of professional selection and online likes. To advance to the next stage, the shortlisted contestants will now be challenged through a ""reality show"" where they will be required to complete a live ""discovery broadcast"" during which the candidates must complete missions, ""remote guest connection"" that one guest for each team to connect and represent overseas challengers within the missions in China, and a ""snap stream,"" among other challenges. CGTN will air the selection process on film. From the very beginning, ""The Media Challengers"" campaign attracted social media influencers, internet celebrities and opinion leaders from all over the world. It has also aroused widespread international media coverage and attention. The candidates are young, energetic, confident and optimistic, and have a unique understanding of the world. Domestically, the final 24 candidates are about to travel to Xi'an, Wuhan, Shanghai or Yunnan to see the beauty of China through their own eyes and document the new developments that are taking place.

In Xi'an, it is hoped that the ancient cultural heritage will inspire the young journalists and allow them to record the ""cultural resonance"" of the city; in Shanghai, the Mid-Autumn Festival special report team will interact with traditional Han cultural activities while presenting their thoughts and those of younger generations; in Wuhan, they will visit the land of Jingchu where ancient and modern meet, while experiencing the charm of the city's heroic past and the market culture that has rapidly recovered from the epidemic; in Yunnan, the contestants will try the latest travel check-in methods, immerse themselves in the fun of operating a homestay, and experience the unique landscape of Chinese mountains and rivers together with young entrepreneurs.

The event provides a platform for aspiring young journalists to display their talents and pursue their dreams while also allowing them to represent their generation's voice in the world. It is also an opportunity for young media professionals to tell Chinese stories. The global epidemic has not yet completely subsided. Considering the actual needs of epidemic prevention and control, overseas Media Challengers cannot come to China. However, this presents a fresh challenge as the new generation of journalists can fully demonstrate the power of technology. In the era of integrated media, multi-screen linkage, the pace of globalization will not stagnate due to time and space constraints.

Is there a future for plant-based seafood?,"A Hope Tree restaurant offers plant-based meatballs produced by Zhenmeat, in Beijing, China, September 4, 2020. /Reuters A Hope Tree restaurant offers plant-based meatballs produced by Zhenmeat, in Beijing, China, September 4, 2020. /Reuters

Plant-based meat alternatives, pegged by creators as a more sustainable food source, have exploded on the Chinese market over the last two years. These vegan options are now available everywhere, from high-end restaurants to fast-food chains like McDonald's. This begs the question: could plant-based seafood be the next big thing?

At the Beijing preview of OmniFoods' new seafood menu on August 29, Arrow Factory Brewing served ""fish"" and chips alongside ""tuna"" fishcakes. Even the omnivores in the room had difficulty believing the flakey double fish burger, laden with cheese and tartare sauce, was entirely vegan. This has been the motivation for the founder of Green Monday & OmniFoods, David Yeung, since his first products went live in 2018 ¨C to create something satisfying for vegans and meat-eaters alike. ""Plant-based meat is an emerging new category which does not need consumers to sacrifice their love for good food,"" Yeung said after the recent launch. ""Over the last few years, we have had successful launches, and we received great reviews, even from meat-eaters who have no intention of becoming vegan.""

It's no surprise that plant-based entrepreneurs like Yeung have been focusing on the Chinese market in recent years, given the steady growth in demand for meat alternatives ¨C a trend that is expected to continue. Consultancy firm Euromonitor has estimated the country's plant-based meat market will grow from around $10 billion in 2018 to nearly $12 billion by 2023. However, plant-based seafood takes up less than one percent of the meat alternative sector. Yeung thinks it's an overlooked area, especially when considering the potential Asian market. ""Asia's seafood intake makes up 73 percent of the global total, compared to 12 percent in Europe and 5.3 percent in the U.S. Seafood is consumed five times more than beef in Asia,"" he said. In Yeung's opinion, plant-based fish could provide a solution to some of the problems currently facing the fishing industry. ""From an impact standpoint, it is of utmost urgency that we protect the marine ecosystem and stop climate change,"" he said. ""The ocean is the lung of the earth, and fishing is causing insurmountable harm to the ocean. Thus, there is an urgency to preserve it in whatever way we can."" However, the vast majority of people are unaware of the environmental challenges facing the oceans. A representative at Green Monday pointed out that although switching to plant-based seafood would be good for the ocean, this reasoning is not yet widely accepted in China. ""Although some know that fish from the ocean or river are very likely to be contaminated and may contain serious toxins like mercury,"" he said, ""That natural resources are quickly depleting, the majority of people remain unaware.""

Memorial ceremony held in NE China to commemorate massacre victims,"02:24

A memorial ceremony was held in northeastern China's Liaoning Province on Thursday to commemorate the victims of the massacre carried out by Japanese invaders in 1932. Representatives from different walks of life participated in the ceremony, observing a moment of silence and laying flowers before a monument specially built in the memory of those killed in the massacre. ""We want to express our deep condolences to the innocent compatriots through the event, which is expected to remind people of the grave sufferings brought by the Japanese invaders and extend Chinese people's determination and willingness to maintain peace,"" said Gai Lanlan, deputy curator of the Pingdingshan Massacre Memorial Hall in the city of Fushun that hosted the event.

On September 15, 1932, more than 1,000 guerrillas from Liaoning attacked some of the Japanese invaders' warehouses and factories in Pingdingshan Village while killing several Japanese soldiers. The next day, in the act of revenge, the Japanese troops rounded up some 3,000 civilians from the village, including many elderly people, women and children. They slaughtered them using cruel ways on the pretext that the villagers had conspired with the guerrillas. The murderers buried the victims on the spot by blowing up a hill in the village. The massacre, the first one during the 14-year Japanese invasion of China, started with an attack on September 18, 1931, in Shenyang, the capital city of Liaoning Province.

The Pingdingshan Massacre Memorial Hall was first built in 1972 after the remains of some 800 victims were unearthed. Over the past decades, memorial activities have been held annually. Representatives from Japanese civil society have also attended some of the events.



""I've visited the memorial hall for several times. I feel so sorry for the victims every time I see the remains. I think every one of us should work hard to make our country stronger to win respect from other countries,"" said Cui Lina, a resident of Fushun.

MOFA backs Stanford professors' call to end 'China Initiative',"The ""China Initiative"" is a tool for anti-China forces in the U.S. to abuse the concept of national security to contain and suppress China, Zhao Lijian, a spokesperson for China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA), told a regular press conference on Tuesday.

A group of 177 Stanford faculty members on Monday sent an open letter to the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), criticizing the ""China Initiative"" launched by the administration of former U.S. President Donald Trump in 2018.

""The China Initiative has deviated significantly from its aimed mission; it is harming the United States' research and technology competitiveness, and it is fueling biases that, in turn, raise concerns about racial profiling,"" they said.

According to Zhao, the media have exposed that the ""China Initiative"" sets targets before investigating cases, and such disregard of judicial justice will only lead to cases involving unjust, false or wrong charges. As of the end of March, none of the so-called China-Related Cases Examples posted on the DOJ website involved intellectual property or commercial theft, with charges ranging from fraud to misrepresentation and tax evasion.

The joint letter signed by the faculty members once again proves that more and more people in the U.S. have realized that the ""China Initiative"" is essentially a tool for anti-China forces in the U.S. to abuse the concept of national security to contain and suppress China, he added. The initiative has not only seriously impacted China-U.S. relations, but also aggravated racial discrimination in the U.S. and caused grave damage to the Asian American community.

""We urge the U.S. side to heed the just call from all walks of life in the U.S., earnestly correct its mistakes and stop interfering with normal exchanges and cooperation between China and the U.S. in science, technology, culture and other fields,"" said Zhao."
David Ferguson wins Special Book Award of China,"The ceremony of the 15th Special Book Award of China was held in Beijing on Tuesday.

Future of work: Will breaking up with the office last forever?,"The past two years have been hard ¨C many are still unable to travel around with COVID-19 restrictions still in place. Yet it has not stopped Zheng Zheng from discovering different coffee shops on a daily basis. She is not one of those internet influencers who check out different fancy cafes to make an income. Like millions who are taking on work-from-home positions, the project manager of an internet company sees it as a way to escape her cramped apartment and remain productive. ""As long as there's Wi-Fi, I can literally work anywhere,"" Zheng told CGTN. Many Silicon Valley executives have been rooting for the rise of remote working since 2020. Last May, Twitter announced its permanent work-from-home plans, calling the flexibility ""the fourth industrial revolution."" ""The future of work is offering employees more optionality,"" said Twitter human resources chief Jennifer Christie. Zheng agreed. ""[Remote working] gives me great flexibility. I could better assign my time, rather than wasting it on things like washing up or taking the subway to the office,"" she said during a Taihe Institute forum on the topic. ""Another great thing is, you can have different sources of income,"" the part-time designer and stylist added. Before returning home to China last January, Zheng had worked as a professional designer and stylist in Los Angeles for years.

Breaking up with the office

""But still, I believe remote working will never completely replace the traditional means of working,"" she said after sharing all the pros. One disadvantage she pointed out is missing out on social interactions with your colleagues, and another is the extended working hours. ""Sometimes, you will need to work 24/7 if you have international clients from both Hangzhou and the UK like I do. You answer their questions when you see them; it doesn't matter what time it is."" While flexible schedules have some obvious benefits, with research showing it generally increases employee happiness and productivity, making the break with the office is certainly more than just missing out on saying hi to your fellow coworkers. ""Face-to-face interaction is required to facilitate collaboration, build relationships, solve complex challenges and generate ideas. Continuous remote work extends the workday, diffuses work-life boundaries and reduces mental well-being,"" Indranil Roy, executive director of Deloitte's Human Capital Department, said in an interview with the BBC.

In a University of Chicago study, employees were found to work longer hours at home for the same task, as focused time was broken up by domestic distractions like childcare and online meetings. Robin Dunbar, emeritus professor of Experimental Psychology at the University of Oxford, told the BBC that he believes remote working is overhyped and certainly won't last long. ""Without face-to-face engagement and those casual meetings round the coffee machine, the 'flow' that makes things work and work fast will be missing. Work groups quickly lose focus, and the sense of belonging ¨C and of commitment to the organization and its aims and objectives ¨C is very quickly lost,"" the BBC quoted Dunbar as saying.

Hybrid work model

""That's why occasionally, I'd still need to be there, say in the factory, and check out the product's quality there,"" Zheng told CGTN. Her work mode is what is now called ""hybrid working,"" which consists of a mixture of home and office work. As time passed and the first wave of coronavirus variants abated only to be followed by the second, companies started to shift to a more hybrid work model, which is expected to give the best of both worlds. Many other urban dwellers share the same sentiment, hoping to get a balance between staying around with colleagues and the efficiencies gained by working remotely. According to a report released by professional networking site LinkedIn this September, 57 percent of the over 1,000 participants in China said they prefer the hybrid model, while 11 percent would choose work from home completely. The same trend has also been seen in the world's biggest economy. In a survey conducted by Stanford University in May 2020, 55 percent of U.S. workers said they want a mixture of onsite and remote working.

A timely film about illegal abortions in 1960s France won the Venice Film Festival's Golden Lion on Saturday, capping a festival rife with female-focused themes.

The film, titled ""Happening,"" wowed viewers on the Lido waterfront with its portrayal of a young woman desperate to arrange a termination to continue with her studies at a time when an abortion could mean a prison term or death.

Directed by Audrey Diwan, the movie is set in France in 1963. But its central theme is as relevant today as it was then, a visibly moved Diwan told the audience, just as the debate about abortion rages again in the United States following new restrictions in Texas.

""I did this movie with anger, with desire, with my belly, my guts, my heart and my head,"" said Diwan, accepting the top prize for her delicately rendered yet gut-punching drama.

In a strong night for women filmmakers, best director went to iconic New Zealand auteur Jane Campion for her emotionally complex Western ""The Power of the Dog,"" starring Benedict Cumberbatch.

The best screenplay award went to Maggie Gyllenhaal for her directorial debut ""The Lost Daughter,"" an unflinching look at the difficulties of balancing career and motherhood starring British Oscar-winner Olivia Colman."

Disney to debut rest of 2021 films in cinemas first,"Disney announced Friday that all of its films slated for release by the end of the year will be exclusively screened in cinemas first, bringing relief to theaters anxious to reconnect with audiences after the coronavirus pandemic devastated their industry.



The animated film ""Encanto"" will be released on the big screen on November 24 and will not appear on Disney's on-demand video platform until December 24, the company said in a statement.



Other planned projects, including ""The Last Duel"" by Ridley Scott, ""Eternals"" by Marvel Studios and ""West Side Story"" by Steven Spielberg, will be screened in theaters for at least 45 days before they are released elsewhere.



The decision was eagerly awaited by traditional cinemas after the entertainment giant recently chose to release a series of big productions such as ""Black Widow"", ""Jungle Cruise"" and ""Cruella"" on its Disney+ platform, diverting part of their revenue.



""Black Widow"" actor Scarlett Johansson has sued Disney, accusing the company of breach of contract and costing her millions of dollars in box office revenue after it released the film on its video platform.



Two years ago, Disney was producing content for both theaters and television channels, but it now has direct access to its audience via streaming, a trend accelerated by the pandemic.



In mid-August, Disney boss Bob Chapek said he favored ""flexibility"" and the ability to ""follow the consumer wherever he goes"".



During a presentation of the company's financial results, he said ""when theaters reopened, there was immense reluctance from the public to return"".



Warner Bros. studios has also been heavily criticised for its decision to release all of its new movies for the rest of the year on its HBO Max platform."

Perfect World design contest opens in Beijing for Chinese students,"In Beijing, the Perfect World Campus Design Competition is underway for young, aspiring artists in China, in a bid to involve college students from across the country and further spark their creativity.

The competition is organized by the tourism bureau of Beijing's Dongcheng District. Last year's inaugural event attracted around 2,300 students from some 300 colleges and universities across China. This year, it aims for an even wider reach, taking the creativity out of campuses for interpretations of Beijing's cultural heritage.

""Dongcheng District is one of the core regions of Beijing. It's not very large in area, but it boasts lots of cultural heritage and resources,"" said Song Xu, deputy director of the Dongcheng District Culture and Tourism Bureau.

Song added that the traditional culture of Xicheng District is especially rich and diverse. She hoped that the event will be a new way to promote China's traditional culture and allow more people to appreciate its charm and beauty.

One of the contest's top priorities is to target young people, and organizers look forward to seeing themselves through young people's perspectives.

Activities will take place in four major venues: the Grand Canal, East of Forbidden City, and two other venues for jewelry design and functional games. The contest will cover themes and cultural elements from ancient and modern China.

Perfect World played a major role in the endeavor. Ruby Wang, senior vice president and spokesperson for Perfect World, said that as a co-organizer of the competition, the company is trying to blend the modern creative industry's ethos with China's cultural tradition.

The prominent company has been exploring this particular field for many years, and has often seen fundamental values shared by the modern and traditional. As a generator of creativity, any company would have its limits. The contest forms part of the company's mission to involve young people and work with other sectors such as high technology.

Eight of Beijing's most prestigious museums will allow access to some collections and archives. Design entries can be sent through a WeChat platform or the official website of Perfect World Company. Submissions will be accepted from Friday to November 10.

A visually impaired tui na therapist's dream comes true,"Luo Chenhao drives on Hulunbuir Grassland under the guidance of a volunteer in north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. /CGTN

""Maybe God was playing a joke on me,"" he said, laughing.

Luo has been unable to see since birth. His parents spent many years taking him from doctor to doctor to get help but couldn't succeed.

Twenty-three-year-old Luo is a practitioner of tui na ¨C a traditional Chinese therapy that involves massage and other manipulation of the body. Unfortunately, his limited light perception means he sees nothing more than shadows. But it doesn't prevent him from challenging himself.

""It was my childhood dream to drive a car,"" said Luo Chenhao as he presses his foot on the accelerator during a road trip to Hulunbuir Grassland in north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. But, until this moment, Luo was always convinced that his dream would never come true, for he has a severe visual impairment.

Luo Chenhao is always positive about life as can be seen when he enjoys himself on vacation on the vast grassland in north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. /CGTN

Luo Chenhao is always positive about life as can be seen when he enjoys himself on vacation on the vast grassland in north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. /CGTN

Growing up, Luo realized that, for a blind person, there were few opportunities to work. His teachers advised him to set up a massage business to earn a living, as this would require only some vocational training. But Luo wanted more.

""I thought I was capable of studying at university,"" he said, ""just like any normally-sighted person. So, why not give it a shot?""

After three years at Zhejiang Pharmaceutical College in east China, he attended the special entrance exam for the visually impaired and was offered a place at Beijing Union University to study acupuncture and tui na.

He also attended three years of further education, finally receiving a bachelor's degree in medicine. After getting the qualification, he was offered a job as a therapist at Hangzhou Tui Na Hospital.

A life-changing hike

Working as a tui na physical therapist provides Luo with a steady income and a comfortable lifestyle. However, by 2018 he was finding the work pressure challenging to handle. So he signed up for a mountain hiking trip designed especially for the visually impaired to escape the stress.

It was the first time he had traveled without his family.

""When we reached the mountain top, I could sense the wide-open landscape,"" Luo recalled. ""I felt my heart had been purified.""

The experience convinced him that he should travel more often.

Reconnecting with society

""You probably consider seeing stunning scenery as the purpose of a trip,"" Luo said. ""In our case, taking a plane for the first time, traveling by train in a sleeping berth¡­ All of these are my experience of a trip.""

But that's not to say that the visually impaired are unable to appreciate nature. On the contrary, many of them, like Luo, can use their senses such as smell, hearing and touch to create a picture of their surroundings in their minds."
"Ningxia, a land made fertile by the Yellow River","Hidden away deep within the country, right on the doorstep of the northwest, insulated from the hustle and bustle of life in the booming cities, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region is a place where the rhythms of life are calm and serene.

Much of what makes Ningxia special, according to the brand new stunningly produced documentary ""A Fertile Land,"" the first season of ""In the Arms of the Yellow River,"" is down to its relationship with the Yellow River.

Indeed, you could say that Ningxia owes everything to China's mother river ¨C the stunning topography that draws sightseers from far and wide, the rich silts laid down by the river over the centuries laying the foundations for the prosperity of Ningxia's jujube growers and the growing fame of its wine industry. In short, for Ningxia, the gifts are given by the Yellow River.

But despite its relatively laid-back lifestyle, the Ningxia portrayed in the film is far from backward-looking.

Whether it's refashioning age-old musical traditions into innovative folk rock, transforming the once-indispensable skin-rafts into an eco-tourism attraction, this documentary is full of examples of a dynamic Ningxia culture that, just like the great Yellow River that gave birth to it and the whole of Chinese civilization, is determined to keep flowing on into the future."

White dew tea: the first cup of tea in autumn,"White Dew, the 15th of the solar terms on the Chinese calendar, falls on September 7 this year. During this solar term, tea lovers are in for a treat: White dew tea is finally ready to be tasted. Unlike spring tea, which is tender and light, or summer tea, which is dry and bitter, white dew tea has a distinctively mellow taste. This fresh taste is inseparable from the weather characteristics of the White Dew term.

Dew can always be found on tree leaves and blades of grass in the early morning during this time of year. /CFP Dew can always be found on tree leaves and blades of grass in the early morning during this time of year. /CFP

White Dew is the dividing line between hot and cold: from this point on, the summer heat fades, and the difference in temperature between day and night gradually widens. As a result, dew can always be found on tree leaves and blades of grass in the early morning during this time of year. The White Dew term is an excellent growth period for tea after the intense heat. And since people are in the habit of gathering morning dew at this time of the year, the tea brewed with this dew has the fragrance of plants and flowers. Not as light as spring tea, nor as bitter as summer tea, the layered taste makes it a favored treat for tea lovers.

Editor's Note: The recent findings of over 1,300 unmarked graves near former indigenous residential schools in Canada once again came as a shock to the international community. Yet, many survivors say these are just the tip of the iceberg. The series intends to throw some light on Canada's dark past. ""The Indian population of Canada has a mortality rate of more than double that of the whole population, and in some provinces more than three times,"" Peter Bryce, a Canadian doctor who was appointed the head medical officer for Indian Affairs in 1904, noted in his annual report in 1906. A year later, after spending months visiting dozens of indigenous residential schools in western Canada, Bryce recorded the high death rate of students at residential schools, some as high as 50 percent, and called it a ""national crime."" Tuberculosis, deaths, and vaccine tests According to Bryce, the highly infectious disease of tuberculosis (TB) was the main cause of indigenous children's deaths at residential schools, and healthy children were deliberately exposed to those carrying the airborne disease.

""We were forced to play with them. The nuns made us play with those kids,"" Virginia Baptiste, a survivor of the St. Eugene's Mission School in British Columbia, said in the documentary ""Unrepentant: Kevin Annett and Canada's Genocide"" (2006). ""We didn't want to get sick either, but they were forcing us to play with those kids, and also they made some of them sleep with the other kids too,"" Baptiste recalled. Directed by Canadian director Louie Lawless, the 106-minute documentary chronicles the country's genocide of its indigenous people at church-run residential schools by drawing upon testimonies of residential school survivors and personal experiences of Kevin Annett, a former minister of St. Andrew's United Church who was expelled from his ministry in 1997.

For decades, indigenous people were treated at segregated tuberculosis sanatoriums and government-run ""Indian hospitals"" where abuses and medical experimentation were reported by survivors, according to CBC News, the country's largest news broadcaster. Maureen Lux, a medical historian at Brock University, said in her research published in 1998 that indigenous children were used as subjects of a TB vaccine trial in the province of Saskatchewan in the 1930s.

Charity to play bigger role as country encourages 'third distribution',"02:18

Sunday marks China's 6th Charity Day. In recent years, philanthropy has taken a bigger role in life in China. And more charities are expected to form, as the government focuses on ""common prosperity"", a concept aiming to ease inequality. This year's ""Charity Day"" comes after an economic leadership meeting in mid-August, which encouraged ""third distribution"" as another key approach to achieving ""common prosperity"". Third distribution means creating opportunities for high-income groups and enterprises to give back. Charity is key to that. Bei Xiaochao is the Secretary General of Chinese Red Cross Foundation, one of the major charity groups in China that focuses on improving national health through charitable means.

""This is a major signal and a major opportunity for the entire sector. We believe that a more favorable policy environment will be created for charity,"" Bei told CGTN, ""In the future, the relevant laws and regulations for charitable organizations will become better, and the fiscal and taxation policies will encourage more donations."" Charity groups believe the potential policy adjustments at the national level will further increase charitable donations. According to Liu Wenkui, secretary general of the China Foundation for Poverty Alleviation, people, especially individuals, in the country are more enthusiast to participate in charity over the last few years.

""In our foundation, individuals accounted for less than 20 percent of the total donations 10 years ago; but these years, the percentage has increased. In the last two years, individual donations have remained above 40 percent That shows the public's enthusiasm for charity has greatly increased,"" Liu said. Liu added, the number of enterprises taking part in charity and the donations they contributed are both on the rise. ""It shows the whole population are really paying more attention to philanthropy,"" he said.

Editor's Note: The recent findings of over 1,000 unmarked graves near former indigenous residential schools in Canada once again came as a shock to the international community. Yet, many survivors say these are just the tip of the iceberg. The series intends to throw some light on Canada's dark past.

""You better behave, don't get out of line because there's the graveyard, and there's also the river, those were warnings that were given to us as little tiny children,"" Barbara McNab-Larson, one of the survivors of Canada's Kamloops Indian Residential School said during an interview with CBC News, the largest news broadcaster in the country.

More than 150,000 Indigenous children were forced to attend state-funded Christian boarding schools from the 19th century through the 1970s in an effort to assimilate them into Canadian society. Thousands of children died there, many of whom were never reunited with their families, as a result of sickness and other causes.



The national humiliation of the schools has resurfaced as a topic of discussion across the country.

Physical and sexual abuse in the schools

Physical and sexual assault were rampant in schools, with students being beaten for speaking their native languages, according to the Canadian government.



""I used to have to run away during the night to get away from that nun,"" said Fred Gordon, a residential school survivor told CTV News Channel. He said he was sexually abused by a nun while at Lebret Indian Industrial Residential School from 1944 to 1951. As a result of the abuse, Gordon was left deaf in one ear and blind in his left eye.



Gordon stated his experience at the residential school still has an impact on facets of his life today, despite the fact that it occurred many years ago.

""Everything was done with a physical"" hand at the school, and children were frequently slapped, punched and kicked, among other abuses, Barry Kennedy, a survivor of the Marieval residential school told CBC.



""We were called to the church one early morning,"" recalled Kennedy. ""We were brought outside and they were burying someone. Who it was, whether it was a boy or a girl, I don't know. But what I do know is that this individual was wrapped in a sheet and there was a hole dug.""



""That's what you're faced with - that along with the confusion of wondering where's your family, that along with the confusion of being lonely,"" Kennedy added.

""They came and took us in big cattle trucks,"" Evelyn Camille, a Kamloops Indian Residential School survivor said during an interview with AFP in June this year.

""We were physically, mentally, spiritually abused,"" the 82-year-old woman chocked up. ""So many of these deaths have never been accounted for.""



""There's never any real closure,"" she admitted. ""The pain is too deep in our hearts, in our minds, in our bodies."" ""But we learn to move on.""



Prior to the discovery of June 30, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said that the national flag on the Peace Tower would be flown at half-mast for Canada Day to remember Indigenous children who died in residential schools."
Elderly Tibetan recalls serf life 70 years ago,"In a small village called Lamo in Taktse District of Lhasa, an elderly Tibetan has lived since he was born. When he was a child over 70 years ago, his family members were serfs and had to work for an owner to earn a living.

Cho Dru remembers that five people lived in a small room. His father herded livestock for the owner. He could not go to school and did not have shoes. They didn't have much to eat, and the owner often beat and locked up serfs who did not obey.

The arrival of the 18th Corps of the People's Liberation Army (PLA), who came to help liberate Tibet, brought young Cho Dru some happiness. He went to watch them train every day and often joined the soldiers when they were eating. He remembers the adults sometimes also went to the army to ask for help to repair tools. Sometimes, the army just gave them new tools for free."
German designer's modern fashion with traditional Chinese textile,"Foreigners were the first batch of renters of Beijing courtyard houses after China's reform and opening-up process began, and many are still fascinated by the authentic Beijinger lifestyle of living in courtyard houses in hutongs ¨C old alleys and narrow streets typically found in Beijing.

Among them is a German fashion designer, Kathrin von Rechenberg, who has been living in Beijing for over 20 years. She is now doing business in a hutong area near the downtown Qianmen Street with her Chinese husband.

What brought Rechenberg to China was a special fabric, Xiang Yun Sha, also known as Liang silk or tea silk.

In 1995, Rechenberg was intrigued by the fabric she saw in Paris. She came to China to look for it in 2000 and then settled down in the country as a designer.

Rechenberg said she was fascinated by the paper-like textile ¨C silky, light, thin and stiff. It is cooling because it does not stick to the skin and has a special shiny glamor, she added.

Every year, Rechenberg goes to south China's Guangdong Province twice to make sure her material is treated the right way.

Xiang Yun Sha is made by being dyed with a plant found in Shunde, Guangdong Province. Its produce process takes more than a dozen intricate steps. Experienced craftsmen will guarantee the right amount of plant juice, sea mud and how long it is dyed, coated with mud and baked under the sun.

Xiang Yun Sha has been a famous product of Shunde since the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644).

Rechenberg, who studied and worked in the Paris fashion scene for eight years, has injected the haute couture spirit into her designs leveraging these special silk garments.

Her collection graced Beijing Fashion Week last autumn. Models attended a contest, wearing her simple yet elegant garments.

The designer said she tries to keep her designs simple, avoiding too much work on the fabric.

""For me, always the fabric comes first and design is following,"" Rechenberg said, adding that she wants to use every part of the material.

She said that the craftsmanship of making Xiang Yun Sha should be honored, comparing it to good wine.

The fabric is rare at a length of 15 meters per roll and needs to be stored for several years until the right color and shine appear, Rechenberg explained."
Italian Renaissance drawings set for Beijing debut,"Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo Buonarroti, Raphael Sanzio, Polidoro da Caravaggio and Titian Vecellio ¨C the drawings of those great names of Italian Renaissance will soon be exhibited in China.

The exhibition titled ""Italian Renaissance: a dialogue with China"" opens at the M Woods Museum in Beijing on Wednesday, marking the first time the British Museum has cooperated with a private Chinese art museum.

The exhibition features the works of artists active on the Italian Peninsula from 1470 to 1580 and is divided into six themes: People, movement, light, clothing, nature and narrative. It delves into how artists from the Renaissance and China used elements such as movement, light and shadow to give life and motion to their creations.

The exhibition was co-curated by juxtaposing Renaissance works with Chinese contemporary art to explore the connection between the Western Renaissance and China across time and space.

""By juxtaposing the works of Renaissance artists with those of contemporary Chinese artists, the exhibition reexamines these historical works from a cross-cultural global perspective,"" said Wang Zongfu, the curator and art director of M Woods Museum, adding that it will open up a new context to explore the parallels and interconnections between these different perspectives and history.

As a response to Renaissance art, several pieces of contemporary Chinese art were created specifically for this exhibition including works by Jin Shangyi and Zeng Fanzhi.

In addition, the exhibition also presents the works of Jiang Baili, Hu Shi, Liang Sicheng, Fu Lei and other key figures in the progress of the Chinese cultural movement in the form of documentary material.

The ""Italian Renaissance: a dialogue with China"" will be open until February 20, 2022."

""Hong Kong has been Chinese territory since ancient times, even when Hong Kong was occupied by Britain after the Opium War (1840-1842), it was still Chinese territory,"" students from Hon Wah College in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) were told in their first class of the new ""citizenship and social development"" curriculum on Thursday.



The class was the first since the controversial liberal studies subject was officially renamed ""citizenship and social development,"" which is regarded as a key stride in HKSAR's education reform, according to Xinhua.

Disputed liberal studies need reform in HKSAR

Liberal studies, one of the four compulsory subjects taught to senior secondary school students since 2009, has been included as a required subject in the Hong Kong College Entrance Examination since 2012. However, its curriculum and evaluation procedures have been questioned since its inception, and have been blamed by Lo Man-tuen, executive director of Hong Kong Association for Promotion of Peaceful Reunification of China Limited, for radicalizing the younger generation.



For example, it included controversial content featuring attacks on ""One Country, Two Systems,"" applauding the illegal ""Occupy Central"" movement, using outdated data when introducing the Chinese mainland, and citing one-sided conclusions about China from a Western perspective.



In November 2020, the Education Bureau (EDB) of the HKSAR government announced plans to streamline liberal studies content and consolidate the knowledge base in accordance with the purpose and objectives of the courses, with new subject titles.

Tip of the iceberg: Canada's cultural genocide of indigenous people,"Children's shoes are placed on the steps of the Vancouver Art Gallery as a memorial to the indigenous children whose remains have been found near a former residential school in Kamloops, British Columbia, Canada, May 28, 2021. /CFP Children's shoes are placed on the steps of the Vancouver Art Gallery as a memorial to the indigenous children whose remains have been found near a former residential school in Kamloops, British Columbia, Canada, May 28, 2021. /CFP

Editor's Note: The recent findings of over 1,000 unmarked graves near former indigenous residential schools in Canada once again came as a shock to the international community. Yet, many survivors say these are just the tip of the iceberg. The series intends to throw some light on Canada's dark past.

""The residential school history within Canada is one of the greatest tragedies, if not the greatest tragedy, in our whole history as a country,"" said church minister Teresa Jones at Lebanese filmmaker Rania Rafei's 40-minute documentary ""Canada's Dark Secret"" (2017). The past months have seen over 1,300 unmarked graves discovered near the sites of former church-run indigenous residential schools in western Canada that appalled people across the world. The latest finding was on July 12, when more than 160 unmarked graves were found around the Kuper Island Industrial School in British Columbia. Before that, remains of 182 indigenous children were discovered near St. Eugene's Mission School in British Columbia on June 30; around 751 unmarked graves were found near Marieval Indian Residential School in Saskatchewan on June 24; another 215 were found near the site of the former Kamloops Indian Residential School in British Columbia on May 27, some as young as three years old. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called these discoveries ""a shameful reminder of the systemic racism, discrimination, and injustice that Indigenous peoples have faced and continue to face in this country.""

Eradication of indigenous culture for over a century After years of investigation and research, Canada's Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) in 2015 concluded that the establishment and operation of residential schools in the country can best be described as ""cultural genocide."" ""The schools were part of a larger effort by Canadian authorities to force Indigenous peoples to assimilate by the outlawing of sacred ceremonies and important traditions,"" said Murray Sinclair, a former Canadian senator and Chair of the TRC. ""It is clear that residential schools were a key component of a Canadian government policy of cultural genocide."" Back in 1876, the Indian Act was passed by the Canadian government, aiming to administer and assimilate the country's indigenous population. Residential schools were then set up to serve the very purpose. Some 150,000 indigenous school-age children across the country were forcibly taken away from their families and sent to these church-run boarding schools between 1863 and 1996, according to the TRC, where they were indoctrinated into the dominant Euro-Canadian and Christian way of life.

""In order to sever those ties in your culture, in your language, they had to separate children from families and communities,"" Roberta Hill, a residential school survivor, said in the documentary. ""We wore uniforms. We all dressed the same. You had your hair cut the same. You were all one,"" Hill recalled her school years at the Mohawk Institute Indian Residential School in Brantford, Ontario, from 1957 to 1961. Students were banned from wearing traditional clothes or performing cultural practices, nor allowed to speak their mother tongue. ""They took us to the church every Sunday. We had to say prayers and things like that. We weren't allowed to talk in our language. We had to speak English,"" said Bud Whiteye, another residential school survivor. As Canada's census in 2016 shows, 15.6 percent of the Aboriginal population in the country are able to converse in an Aboriginal language ¨C a sharp drop from 21.4 percent in 2006. Many of the indigenous languages are spoken by less than 10,000 people, some by only hundreds.

""I know from my own experience, people that I've known, they were raised by whites in the residential schools. So when they were finished there, their parents didn't accept them because they weren't native. And the white community did not accept them because they were native,"" Ron Shortt, former Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) officer said. ""So these people, 150,000 children, grew up in limbo with no roots, no background and no place they could call home,"" Shortt added."

New pressure reduction policies to give young students more free time,"No paper-and-pencil exams will be arranged for first and second graders in primary schools, and only a final examination is allowed at the end of the semester for other grades, said Lyu Yugang, the director of the Ministry of Education's department of basic education during a press conference on Monday.



The changes come amid a national campaign to reduce excessive homework and off-campus tutoring for students receiving the nine-year compulsory education.

A new approach for the new semester

Schools are required to introduce specific regulations on preventing excessive academic burdens on students. An online questionnaire will be opened to the general public, and the feedback will be considered an important indicator for reference when evaluating the performance of schools in this regard, according to Lyu. In July, Chinese authorities introduced a set of guidelines to effectively reduce the heavy workload placed on students and the financial burden on parents. The overall requirement is to pursue a high-quality basic education, improve school education and develop a complete system of on-campus services, said Lyu.

As the main battlefield in the campaign, schools need to recalibrate homework assignments, provide better after-class services and improve classroom teaching, he said. The ministry said clubs for arts, sports, labor skills, reading and other hobbies are encouraged. Teachers are allowed to work on a flexible schedule and obtain subsidies for after-class services. Retired teachers, professionals and volunteers will be enlisted, according to the ministry. Schools are encouraged to launch innovative programs and textbooks while making good use of online courses created by elite teachers across the country, Lyu said, adding that a nationwide selection of high-quality basic education courses was launched earlier this month.

What does the new policy mean for students, parents and teachers?

""The new policies have brought me relief,"" said a middle school student named Xiaoyi. ""I would have more time to read science fiction (books), which is my real hobby."" The new policy stipulates that off-campus training institutions are prohibited from using national statutory holidays, rest days, winter and summer holidays to organize training.



""I think the new policy will be a relief for children like mine,"" said a married woman surnamed Wang, who is also a college teacher in Guangzhou, the capital of south China's Guangdong Province. ""We really want schools to evaluate kids multidimensionally, not just by grades,"" she added. Employment in first-tier cities in the education and training industry contracted sharply, with the number of jobs in July down 32.4 percent from March before the new policy was enacted, according to leading recruitment website Zhaopin.com's 2021 Education and Training Industry Talent Market Analysis report. ""I really like being a teacher but now I can only teach midweek evenings,"" said a math teacher surnamed Fu. She said she will look at the situation of students and their parents applying for classes in the new semester. If the business is really bad, she may go back to schools or find other jobs. ""The goal of the new policy is to reduce repetitive training so that students can develop in an all-around way and face the uncertainty of the future with their determined abilities,"" said Yang Zhenfeng, an official from the Shanghai Municipal Education Commission."
"Afghanistan faces humanitarian, economic crisis as U.S. troops leave","00:53

The United States completed its military withdrawal from Afghanistan on Monday as the last plane carrying troops flew out of Kabul airport. While the U.S. is still evacuating Afghan allies and civilians, the departure of its last contingent of service members marks an end to the 20 year military presence that is officially being recognized as the longest war in U.S. history.

The U.S. spent its last day of withdrawal mourning the service members that were killed in a suicide bombing at Kabul airport by IS-K, the Islamic State group's Afghan affiliate. The U.S. had counter attacked IS-K forces with a drone strike in Kabul, but the strike reportedly killed 10 Afghan civilians, including six children. The strike and the civilian casualties are currently under investigation.

With U.S. forces officially withdrawn from the nation, the Taliban, which took control of Afghanistan on August 15th, declared Afghanistan ""fully independent"". With thousands of Afghan civilians displaced or on the run from Taliban rule, the country now faces a humanitarian crisis as well as a turbulent economy. Families crowded into refugee camps and lined up to receive food and other resources donated by humanitarian aid groups.

Banks reopened in Afghanistan with restrictions placed on the amount of cash that could be withdrawn as thousands of Afghan civilians were lining up outside the bank to withdraw their money amid an uncertain future for the country.

Gyms for senior citizens gain traction in Shanghai,"03:14

It may be a weekday afternoon, but a gym in Shanghai's Xuhui District is packed with people ¨C specifically, people aged 55 and above. Stepping foot inside, you won't be greeted by an adrenaline-pumping vibe or music as you would in most gyms. Rather, you'll find many retirees sitting in repose on massage chairs (which boost blood circulation), brisk walking on treadmills (which have a limited top speed), as well as chest and leg workouts which have less resistance. The mood here is one that's unfazed. People are in no rush at all. ""I come here every day to stay healthy, rain or shine,"" 80-year-old Huo Guanmin, a retired middle school teacher, tells CGTN. He says the changes he's felt since he started working out weren't immediate ¨C but he's noticed some benefits over time. ""My feet are no longer numb and swollen, my sleep is better. Plus, since coming here, the prostate-specific antigen marker in my blood tests has stabilized further. I had prostate cancer and underwent an operation in 2016.""

Eighty-year-old Huo Guanmin (R) said he comes to this gym every day. /CGTN Eighty-year-old Huo Guanmin (R) said he comes to this gym every day. /CGTN

Huo is not new to exercising. He has done his rounds, including tai chi, in parks before. But he finds coming to this gym ¨C located in the community center where he lives ¨C convenient. ""It's a great platform (for us) to socialize. Else, it's just my wife and I at home every day, you know. How much can we talk about?"" he jokes. ""After coming to this gym, I got to know and meet people who lived in my building. Previously, we didn't know each other even though we enter and exit through the same entrance. Now, after out workout, we would sometimes go out and eat together."" Huo claims his generation is ""way luckier"" than the previous generation who did not have such gym facilities for older people. There are reportedly about 30 such senior citizen gyms now operating in Shanghai, and the municipal government plans to up this to at least 100 by 2025. The modus operandi is this: The Shanghai government is in charge of constructing the gym and covering the rental. But the gym's day-to-day operations are managed by a third party company. Most of these gyms have been built within local communities.

For 63-year-old Xu Wenying, it has also become a daily routine and necessity for her to slot in a workout. She joined the gym when it opened over two years ago, and feels her state of mind has improved. ""Also, I've managed to lose weight even though I've consumed more food. Initially I didn't dare eat too much for fear of putting on weight,"" she says. ""But alas! I feel very happy. People here are of about the same age so we have common topics. At the end of the day, it's so important to maintain a good mood!"" Members pay 69 yuan (about $10) monthly as a fee ¨C after deducting sports coupons distributed by the Shanghai Municipal Sports Bureau for seniors. Each member will receive a basic health check prior to officially joining the gym. And before and after each of their workouts, they get their blood pressure tested too. Besides workout equipment tailored specifically for senior citizens at the gym, there is also a daily video-guided Eight-Section Brocade (a set of traditional Qigong exercises).

The company behind this gym, Newbody Lohas, currently directly operates 23 such gyms in Shanghai. It plans to expand to cover most communities and towns in Shanghai. It also has ambitions to expand across China. ""We also hope to offer value-added services to the elderly in time, such as customized one-on-one sessions, and perhaps even embedding medical elements in our centers ¨C beyond just physical exercise,"" says Deputy General Manager Wang Liang. It's a common sight in China to come across senior citizens exercising, dancing in public squares or practicing tai chi in parks. These indoor gyms serve as an alternative, said Zhong Renyao, professor at the school of public administration at East China Normal University. ""As the consumption and spending power of the elderly is released in the future, the market scale of this (elderly gym) industry will be large,"" Zhong tells CGTN.

Professor Zhong Renyao (R) of East China Normal University said the unwillingness of the elderly to spend money is the biggest difficulty facing the elderly care industry.

Season's greetings: Epiphyllum ¨C queen of the night,"Epiphyllum, described as the queen of the night, belongs to the Cactus family. Its large funnel-shaped flowers are very aromatic. Since epiphyllum only blooms at night, people have given this flower a lot of beautiful stories.

Epiphyllum's first flowering is a moment of beauty, a moment of eternity.

The symbolic character of the epiphyllum is its short flowering time, therefore, people commonly used the blooming epiphyllum as a metaphor for how good things don't last.

On the other hand, because of this rarity, it's also a sign of luckiness for those who see its bloom. In China, home-grown epiphyllum blooms are often seen as a sign of good things to come.

There is also a sad and graceful love story about epiphyllum."

A screenshot of the photographs and restoration of Petalodus teeth found in Yangquan City, north China's Shanxi Province, published in the journal Acta Geologica Sinica in August, 2021.

The shark with petal-shaped teeth is a very mysterious and primitive fish, mainly living between 360 million and 250 million years ago, said the first author of the study, Gai Zhikun, from the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology under the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).

In terms of size, the shark's tooth fossil is similar to the tooth of the great white shark. It can be estimated that it is a prehistoric giant shark with a body length of three to five meters, says co-author Lin Xianghong, also from CAS.

So far, the fossil of the shark species has been found in multiple places in the Earth's Northern Hemisphere. Besides Europe and America, the shark's fossil has been found in China and Japan, indicating that it had the ability to migrate across the oceans and was probably a predator with strong swimming capabilities, according to the researchers.

Abundant fossil evidence shows that the city of Yangquan was a warm and transparent shallow sea near the equator more than 200 million years ago, suitable for all kinds of marine life to survive, said fellow co-author Bai Zhijun with the Planning and Natural Resources Bureau of Yangquan City."

"China ramps up rectification of harmful, irrational fan behavior","CFP CFP

The Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) published a notice on Friday decreeing all cyberspace authorities across the country to intensify efforts to regulate online platforms and celebrity agents to help netizens rationally support their superstar idols. The CAC prescribed rectification with specific measures over the ""sick"" parts of the ""fan circle"" culture in the entertainment industry, and tackling the long-controversial moves by teenage fans who blindly idolize celebrities with excessive spending on their ""idols."" The CAC ordered internet platforms to draw up clear and strict guidelines for celebrity agents regarding online account registration, posts, commercial promotion, emergency public relations and fan management. When fans express support for their idols through bad language or false claims about other celebrities, the authority said that internet platforms must remove such posts promptly and harshly punish those that post them.

Online communities, groups, and channels that cause disturbances, including those that encourage fans to raise money for celebrities or share gossip about them, will be cleaned up and shut down, the advisory said. Online programs and talent shows are also forbidden from encouraging fans to pay to vote for contestants. Streaming giant iQiyi announced on August 25 that it is suspending its talent competitions for the next few years and canceling other shows' online voting segments. According to the Global Times, some popular culture observers noted that younger fans whose value systems are yet to be formed are more likely to become combative and act irrationally after indulging in fan circle culture. They are mobilized to do whatever ""opinion leaders"" ask to seek a sense of collectivity and affiliation. How the youth think and act will determine the future of the country and that's why the entire society must create a healthy environment for their development, experts said. The CAC in mid-June and July launched campaigns targeting ""sick"" fan culture that adversely affected the adolescent."

A seven-member boy idol group in China has been disbanded only four days after its establishment, amid overwhelming criticism that the company is profiting from school-age children. The Asia Starry Sky (ASE), the group's agency, announced the decision on Tuesday night. ""The 'Panda Boys' is dismissed as from today, and we will carefully and properly handle the follow-up work,"" read a statement by the company issued on its official account on twitter-like Weibo, a popular social networking platform in China.

We'll discuss where the company is heading to next after this matter is settled,"" Sun is quoted as saying.

The Panda Boys, composed of seven boys aged between seven and 11, made their debut on August 20 in Chengdu, the provincial capital of southwest China's Sichuan. The news soon stirred heated debate online. The majority said that children should receive education at school at such a young age rather than making money as idols. In response to the mounting controversies, the company explained the next day on Weibo that it's ""not taking the children as a tool to make money, but incubating a new generation of teenage role models with 'epochal significance'.""

It further underlined that creating this performance group aims to promote traditional local culture through artistic works integrating various elements. Such claims failed to ease public dissatisfaction. The Guangming Daily, one of the nation's influential media outlets, commented that if the company was aiming to cultivate models of the new era, the boys should study and grow up at school as their peers do. ""That's where they belong to, not under the spotlight,"" it said.

The mother of one of the boys told local news portal chengdu.cn that she was not trying to cultivate her kid into a future star for profits, and she just thought it's a special experience for him to learn something useful. ""People are bringing shame on the children before they make the whole thing clear. The children are just the victims,"" said the mother surnamed Zhang.

The city's educational department said they've paid close attention to the matter and that they would start an investigation into whether any of the children quit school for showbiz. Chinese laws stipulate that all school-age children are obliged to receive compulsory education and that any employer is prohibited from hiring school-age children and teenagers. The short-lived Panda Boys has reminded many of another so-called ""fostering"" idol group ¨C the TF Boys. The three members were around 13 when they started their entertainment career in 2013. The boys soon swept across the country and won a huge number of fans and various honors. Jackson Yee, one of the members, has just topped the Forbes China Celebrity List for the second year in a row, according to the 2021 list published by Forbes China on August 20.

Experts worry about worsening opium trade under Taliban,"Despite the chaos besetting Afghanistan and the fall of Kabul to the Taliban, the illegal drug trade has continued to thrive out of the country, according to reports from the United Nations.

The economic situation in Afghanistan has been grim since the Taliban takeover of the country during the U.S. withdrawal.

Prices have skyrocketed for essential items, and the U.S. has frozen billions of dollars belonging to Afghanistan¡¯s central bank.

But officials point to the illegal drug trade as a possible method for the Taliban to make money.

The Taliban found ways to continue by profiting from Afghanistan¡¯s opium and heroin trade, despite 15 years of the U.S. efforts to eradication poppy fields and raid suspected labs, which reportedly cost more than $8 billion.

In June, a letter from the U.N. Security Council said the ¡°production and trafficking of poppy-based drugs and methamphetamine¡­remains the Taliban¡¯s largest single source of income,¡± adding that the drug trade has ¡°a destabilizing and corrupting effect within Afghanistan and contributes significantly to the narcotics challenges facing the wider international community.¡±

As of 2019, the U.N. estimated that the overall income from the consumption, production, and export of opiates in Afghanistan was estimated between $1.2 billion and $2.1 billion.

The Taliban generates nearly $460 million annually from taxes on the sale of heroin within their territories, the U.N. reports.

The United Nations of Office on Drugs and Crime found that the opium poppy cultivation is most prevalent in villages under non-state control, noting that poppy farming appeared to take place in villages regarded as less secure.

According to the 2020 Afghanistan Opium Survey, opium poppy cultivation increased by 37%, growing by at least 224,000 hectares.

The UNODC estimates that opium production contributed up to 11% of Afghanistan¡¯s economy in 2018. The country¡¯s opium cultivation makes up more than 80% of the world¡¯s supply.

The UNODC warns that because of the COVID-19 pandemic, more women and children could be forced to work in the cultivation and opiate production if farmers in some regions don't find enough workers to help during the start of the season.

Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid said they 'will bring opium cultivation down to zero again' and that there would be no smuggling out of the country.

The Taliban banned poppy cultivation in 2000, but the decision generated a backlash and eventually, the Taliban changed their stance."
Reporter's Diary: My close encounters with Taliban members in Kabul,"Saturday was the seventh day since Taliban fighters took control of Afghanistan's capital, Kabul. Residents of Kabul are still trying to get used to Taliban's presence on the city's roads. They are the topic of our daily dialogue, but we don't know how to get along with them and what they're really like. So my brother and I went out to talk to some Taliban members. At one bus station, we met a Taliban fighter. He introduced himself as Abdul Wahed, a resident of Maidan Wardak province who came to Kabul along with other Taliban members. I asked him how people reacted to their presence, he responded with a loud laugh: ""It has been six days since we arrived in Kabul, and now it is calm, there are no security reports in this Hazara area. The condition is perfectly normal, thank goodness. All the people of Hazara are doing well and there is no problem here."" At the Afghan Military School, a group of Taliban members were standing and talking. We went to them to learn about the situation in the city. To our surprise, they gently welcomed us and said they were very happy that after years of war, they were finally able to return to their hometown and reunite with their families.

Zia-ul-Haq joined the Taliban from Jawzjan province and has been fighting against the Afghan government for nearly 19 years. He told me he was ""very happy"" that the war was over and that he could now live without fear. ""We're tired of war, and no one likes war. It was a holy responsibility to fight for the occupation,"" he said. ""Now all the people of Afghanistan can live freely and remove all fears from their hearts."" Alamuddin is another Taliban fighter who was born in Paghman district of Kabul province. He's now able to visit his family and friends again after a long time. He told me he's glad that his opposition accepted the Taliban and he entered Kabul without a fight. However, not all the Taliban members were that nice. Later in the afternoon, we went to the 13th police precinct to try our luck for an interview with the chief security officer. There were many Taliban soldiers at the entrance to the command post, some of them were armed.

How Hollywood depicts Afghan war,"The U.S. started to invade Afghanistan back in 2001. Though former U.S. President Barack Obama declared an end to the war in 2014, the U.S. military has yet to completely withdraw. During these years, Hollywood has made many movies based on the war in Afghanistan. Most of them explain the necessity of the U.S. war and pave the way for sufficient reasons for the U.S. government to withdraw its troops from Afghanistan.

These movies use a ""Hollywood formula,"" depicting a heroic character and using fancy visual effects to strengthen the image of U.S. troops as ""saviors.""

In this way, the failure and inhumanity of the war are neglected. For example, ""The Outpost,"" which was released in 2020, tells the story of a group of U.S. troops at an outpost in Afghanistan. They not only need to guard against sneak attacks from the Taliban, but also need to appease local Afghan residents."

Producer's Notebook | One Hundred Years Young: The CPC Way,"A poster for CGTN's six-episode documentary ""The CPC Way."" /CGTN A poster for CGTN's six-episode documentary ""The CPC Way."" /CGTN

To understand China today, one must know about the Communist Party of China, the CPC. As the Party marks its centennial in 2021, it's an occasion to review its path and forecast its future. The image of the CPC is widely divided on global media. Some have praised its resolve in strict governance; others have criticized the CPC as being authoritarian. There aren't many documentaries about the CPC outside China. So CGTN decided to make the six-episode documentary.

Guo is a third-generation forest ranger at Babusha, a large sand dune on the southern edge of the Tengger Desert in northwest China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region. /CGTN

One of the biggest challenges is how to present the CPC within the global discourse. There are many negative stereotypes about the CPC around the world. The ideological confrontation poses a challenge to any director. That's why a project like this matters so much. ""The CPC Way"" is not an argument about which system is better but an overall depiction of the CPC's theories and practices. Some Chinese experts point out that, unlike Western political parties, the CPC is ""internally pluralistic."" Where Western critics say it's a ""one-party autocracy,"" Chinese experts contend it is ""pluralism in one body."" It's a circle, with the CPC at its core, representing the greatest common interests of the whole society.

The series brings the practical to the theoretical. We want it to engage the viewers, not lecture them. The six episodes are six journeys exploring the CPC's hard-won victories and the prices paid for the achievements: How the Party began, whom it serves and how, what's behind the policies, and where it is heading. To get the answers, for four months, we profiled nearly 100 people from different walks of life across the country, ranging from workers, farmers, soldiers and CPC officials to scientists, foreigners, and non-Party members.

College move-in day,"It's a big stage in many teenagers' lives: that moment when they leave home and move in to college for the very first time.

""Yeah, I'm super excited. I¡¯m from Milwaukee, Wisconsin so this is something super new and super fun for me.""

""Moving away from home, getting the experience of living by yourself, meeting new people, all that stuff.""

Here at the University of Colorado Boulder, thousands of students, accompanied by their parents, received one hour appointments recently to move all of their stuff into this residence hall.

""I think move-in day is always an emotional day.""

This one, a school spokesperson said, came with an added burst of energy¡­

""For students who spent a lot of their school year remotely last year there¡¯s extra excitement there.""

Online learning was often the default option in education when the pandemic was raging. In-person classes will be the norm here and on many other campuses this fall.

""I didn't ever go back to high school after my junior year and so I think I'll be okay.""

""She's a visual learner and I think it helps her to have interpersonal reaction with her classmates. She learns better. She struggled with online classes to be honest with you.""

""One thing is certainly different on this move-in day: students are armed not only with their possessions, they also have immunity against the virus.""

A year ago, negative COVID-19 test results were required of all students. Vaccines were still on the horizon. Now, more than 700 universities across the country have made them an enrollment requirement. CU Boulder is also mandating masks in all public indoor spaces, just to be safe.

""As we start the semester, as we get a huge influx of people to campus, it's an additional precaution to help prevent the Delta variant that we¡¯re seeing a surge of in the community.""

While some say a virus outbreak or new measures to prevent one are always possible, they think this school year can only be an improvement over the last.

""It was a tough year for the students and I'm concerned how that will go for them and counting on the administration to do a good job.""

""I'm not worried about health and safety, I'm worried about annoyance and overreaction more than anything. But if it makes a lot of people feel better to have kids wear masks in the classes, then so be it and hope it doesn't last very long.""

""Everybody on campus should be vaccinated so I'm feeling pretty safe.""

The biggest challenge now is squeezing these belongings into one dorm room. Not something some past move-in veterans needed to worry about.

""I had two small bags and she's got two carts.""

This is the way institutions of higher learning largely operated pre-pandemic. Students venturing out on their own, that hasn't changed.

""I think he just wants us out, to get going.""

""It's his next chapter in life, so it¡¯s awesome, it's going to be great."""

Chinese vlogger Caiqian who ""recovered"" the Sanxingdui gold mask recently went viral again with his new work ¨C the ""restoration"" of the golden rod of Sanxingdui. The replica took 900 grams of gold and four months of labor to make.

His video showcasing the rod has been viewed more than 1.29 million times on Weibo, and the official Weibo account of the Sanxingdui Museum has also given him a thumbs up, recognizing him for his ""restoration.""

Caiqian became well-known on Chinese social media after he ""restored"" a gold mask that was excavated from the No.5 sacrificial pit at the Sanxingdui Ruins site in southwest China's Sichuan Province on March 20, 2021.

Compared with the gold mask, which took him only 15 days to complete, the rod took him four months because of its intricate design.

The original golden rod of Sanxingdui is 143 centimeters long, 2.3 cm in diameter and weighs 463 grams, and is made of gold-plated wood that boasts a gold leaf design wrapped around the length of its body. Used as a sacrificial tool in the ancient Shu state about 3,000 years ago, the rod was a symbol of the power of the ancient Shu kingdom.

The leaf design is an exquisite 46-centimeter-long decorative pattern of arrows, birds, fish and people and was the most challenging part of Caiqian's ""restoration."""
Who was Josephine Baker and why are her remains being moved?,"Baker was friends with the biggest movie stars, like Charlie Chaplin, seen her congratulating Baker at the Moulin Rouge in Paris./AFP file Baker was friends with the biggest movie stars, like Charlie Chaplin, seen her congratulating Baker at the Moulin Rouge in Paris./AFP file

This is the story of an American jazz singer who became a hero of France. On Sunday, France's President Macron announced Josephine Baker's remains would be interred at the Pantheon in Paris in November. To be buried there is regarded as one of the highest honors in France. Others laid at the so-called ""Temple of the French nation"" include some of the country's most famous writers, thinkers, and scientists, including Victor Hugo, Alexandre Dumas, Marie and Pierre Curie, and most recently Simone Veil in 2018. But Baker will be the very first Black woman to be given the posthumous honor.

Why is an American a French hero? Baker was born in Missouri in 1906, and soon moved to New York to be part of the radical Black art scene, the Harlem Renaissance. But it was in Paris where Baker really hit the big time. In 1925 she started a show at the Theatre des Champs-Elysees in the very center of the city of lights. And from there, her career blossomed, with her often erotic dancing and ""exotic"" shows playing on her race gained a big following - which included some of the most famous writers and artists of her day. Ernest Hemingway called her ""the most sensational woman anyone ever saw,"" and Pablo Picasso painted her on several occasions. But she was rejected by U.S. audiences and critics because of her ethnicity and gave up her U.S. citizenship in 1937 to become French by marriage.

Baker was awarded some France's highest honors, including the 'L¨¦gion d'honneur'/ Associated Press file Baker was awarded some France's highest honors, including the 'L¨¦gion d'honneur'/ Associated Press file

Singer turned Spy Then World War II began. Baker was quickly recruited to the ""Second Bureau"" - the French equivalent of MI5 or the CIA. She was tasked with passing on secrets she uncovered at Parisian parties, often attended by Nazi officers. Her work also gave her a chance to travel around Europe, and even some parts of South America. That gave Baker the opportunities she needed to share the information with the Allied forces. She was awarded both the Croix de Guerre (The War Cross) and was made a Knight of the L¨¦gion d'honneur for her work. They are regarded as the highest honors, reserved for heroes of France. Pascal Bruckner, is a member of the group which petitioned for Baker to be moved from Monaco to the Paris landmark. ""Josephine Baker is a true anti-racist, a true anti-fascist,"" he said. Baker died in 1975 and was buried in Monaco.

"Shariah: What it is, and what it means for Afghans","CFP CFP

At their first press conference after entering Kabul, Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid said the Taliban would guarantee women's rights within the limits of Shariah. The vague expression drew attention worldwide, since the Taliban have a notorious reputation mainly due to their five years of ruling Afghanistan. However, Shariah allows room for interpretation. Besides, it seems the group has been dedicated to showing a more moderate image in front of the world. So, what is Shariah, and what does it mean for ¨C not only women ¨C but all Afghans?

What is Shariah?

The word originates from Arabic, literally meaning ""the path to water."" While the legal aspect of Shariah is commonly stressed, people sometimes forget the word contains more meaning than that. Shariah is a set of ways people should act in all aspects, from religious to ethical behavior. A law states the rights people have and the crimes people should not commit, and Shariah exceeds it by containing content about what people should do. The foundation for Shariah is the Quran, Islam's holy book, as well as the deeds and sayings of the Prophet Muhammad. However, the fragmented sentences in the Quran provide only general guidance to Muslims, and it's hard to apply them to specific questions. When facing a dispute, people depend on experts in Shariah to arbitrate, leaving room for interpretation.

Shariah for the Taliban

Experts are divided into several schools according to how they understand and explain Shariah. Some put extra weight on Muhammad's words and deeds, others appreciate the personal judgement of scholars. The latter is called the Hanafi school and used to be prevalent in Afghanistan. The Taliban, though, follow a different path. The Hanbali school, which is the strictest in Sunni Islam, takes priority in the Taliban's Shariah practices. Describing as ""strict,"" the Hanbali school extremely emphasizes the Quran and the Prophet Muhammad's teaching, and looks down upon speculative reasoning by humans. The difference in schools can lead to great divergence on verdicts. Take drinking alcohol, which is considered as one of the severest sins in Shariah (called Shurb al-Khamr in Arabic), as an example. The Hanafi school believes only drinking spirits breaks Shariah law, while other schools prohibit all alcoholic drinks. All schools agree the punishment should be flogging, yet they differ from one another on the number of lashes.

What might be changed, and what might this mean for Afghans now?"
Zhongyuan Festival: How to mark China's 'ghost festival',"Lanterns float on the Wanquan River in Qionghai, south China's Hainan Province, September 2, 2020. /CFP Lanterns float on the Wanquan River in Qionghai, south China's Hainan Province, September 2, 2020. /CFP

The Zhongyuan Festival goes by many names. Followers of Buddhism call it Ullambana, while many around China refer to it as the ""Ghost Festival."" It falls on the 15th day of the seventh month on lunar Chinese calendar. This year, the date corresponds to August 22 on the Gregorian calendar.

The belief goes that on this day the gates of the spiritual realms open and so people hold all kinds of activities to honor their deceased loved ones.

Honoring ancestors

The Zhongyuan Festival is one of three traditional festivals in China that honor the departed spirits of ancestors. It is also an occasion to pray for safety and express filial piety. The other two festivals are Qingming Festival and the Double Ninth Festival.

The festival is marked by followers of Taoism and Buddhism. Taoists believe the god of hell frees ghosts from the lower realm on this day, while Buddhists take it as a day to ease suffering and honor the elderly.

During the Tang Dynasty (618-907), the Ullambana Festival was introduced to Japan along with Buddhism and was later called Obon, or Bon. On this day, dead ancestors are believed to return to their living families, so people prepare for the reunion with the performance of Bon Odori, or a Bon dance, to welcome the spirits and pay homage to their sacrifices. The Zhongyuan Festival is marked in different ways in China.

Burning fake money

In folklore stories, the deceased ancestors are released by Yama, the god of hell, for half a month. At the end of their stay in this world, people send them off by burning joss paper with the intention of sending money and other items with them to the afterlife.

Floating water lanterns

Floating water lanterns is another way to mark the festival. They are shaped like the lotus flower and a candle or a lamp is usually placed in the middle. The lotus is a symbol of fortune and enlightenment in Buddhism and is meant to wish the ancestors peace.

A fossilized egg from an extinct prehistoric giant turtle with an embryo still inside has been discovered in central China's Henan Province.

A screenshot of the photographs and CT images of the fossilized egg published in the biological research journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences in August, 2021.

Based on 3D reconstruction with the help of high-precision micro-CT scanning, researchers confirmed that the huge and unusually thick-shelled egg was from the Nanhsiungchelyidae, an extinct group of large terrestrial turtles.

According to researcher Han Fenglu from the China University of Geosciences in Wuhan, who first discovered the ancient egg during a field trip in Henan in 2018, it is rare to successfully link a turtle egg fossil with a specific genus.

The turtle that laid the egg was likely to be as long as 1.6 meters, according to the estimation.

The egg shell was nearly 2 millimeters thick, making it among the world's largest and thickest-shelled Mesozoic turtle eggs so far discovered.

Researchers are still investigating the reason for the thick shell, but they say it was probably to adapt to an unusually extreme environment at that time.

""We have found a structure that looks suspiciously like bone in the broken part of the eggshell,"" said Han. ""It is likely that a baby turtle was close to breaking out of its shell.""

Turtles originated in the late Triassic Period and gradually evolved into reptiles over a period of more than 200 million years.

Osmanthus is mentioned in the ""Classics of Mountains and Seas"" of the Warring States Periods (475¨C221 BC). From the Han Dynasty (202 BC-220 AD) to the Wei, Jin, and Northern and Southern dynasties(420-589), osmanthus has been a valuable flower and a symbol of good things.

Italian fugitive connected to stolen Van Gogh paintings arrested,"A suspected Italian drug trafficker who police believe may have bought two stolen Vincent Van Gogh paintings has been arrested in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), a police statement said on Thursday.

Raffaele Imperiale, 46, was arrested in Dubai on August 4 by local authorities, who cooperated with the Italian police. He had been on the run since 2016 and Italy had included him on the list of its most dangerous fugitives.

In 2016, two Van Gogh paintings stolen in Amsterdam in 2002 ¨C ""Congregation Leaving the Reformed Church in Nuenen"" and ""View of the Sea at Scheveningen"" ¨C were found by police in a villa Imperiale owned near Naples.

Each painting was worth an estimated 50 million euros ($58 million), investigators said after recovering them.

Police said Imperiale is a key figure in an international drug trafficking and money laundering ring and has a close relationship with the Camorra mafia gang based around the southern Italian city of Naples.

In the old Tibet, barbarous feudal serfdom was practiced. Over 90 percent of Tibetans struggled for subsistence, and up to 95 percent were illiterate. Seven decades ago, the ""17-Article Agreement"" signed by the central government and Tibet's local government re-established China's sovereignty in the region, and cleared the path of ending serfdom and advancing Tibetan society. Wang Yang, chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) National Committee, is leading the central government delegation to Tibet. In his speech, he called the peaceful liberation a ""historic transition with epoch-making significance for Tibet."" ""Since then, Tibet has embarked on a path from darkness to brightness, from backwardness to progress, from poverty to prosperity, from autocracy to democracy, and from closeness to openness,"" said Wang.

Nicole Kidman gets quarantine exemption by Hong Kong for TV series,"Australian actress Nicole Kidman was exempted from quarantine in Hong Kong last week for filming an Amazon-funded series despite the fact that the Chinese financial hub braced for more draconian COVID-19 travel restrictions to take effect from midnight Thursday.

The Commerce and Economic Development Bureau of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) confirmed Thursday that the Hollywood star and other film crew had been granted an exemption ""to carry out designated professional work.""

The exemption contrasts sharply with entry rules for residents that are some of the most stringent coronavirus requirements globally, sparking online criticism from residents in the special administrative region of China.

Many travelers to Hong Kong have to do up to 21 days mandated quarantine in a hotel, even those who are vaccinated. The measures have led to many residents not being able to visit relatives and travel overseas for nearly two years.

Social media has since filled with comments by expats and local residents over Kidman's quarantine exemption.

""So we have HK residents who can't come back if not vaccinated (and even then with 2-3 weeks quarantine) but Nicole Kidman can just enter like this? It's disgusting!"" said a Twitter user called @WhovianBooknerd.

Kidman was in the city to film a TV series called ""The Expats."" She was spotted shopping and filming after arriving from Sydney last week, according to online news site HK01."

UNICEF says some Taliban officials support education for Afghan girls,"The messages from the Taliban are ""more or less the same"" but with ""small differences,"" especially in terms of girls' education, Messaoud told reporters during a United Nations press briefing.

Taliban representatives in some parts of Afghanistan have expressed support for educating girls after the Taliban retook the country, Mustapha Ben Messaoud, United Nations Children's Fund's (UNICEF) chief of field operations in Afghanistan, said on Tuesday.

""There are areas, parts of the country, where they told us they're waiting for guidance from their leadership, religious and political. In other places they're actually, they said that they want to see girls' education and schools up and running,"" Messaoud added.

Addressing the ability for female aid workers and female Afghan staff to continue in their roles, Messaoud said the Taliban have given ""mixed, measured answers"" but that UNICEF is ""cautiously optimistic.""

At least 11 of UNICEF's 13 field offices in Afghanistan have remained operating since the Taliban took over the country on Sunday, Reuters reported. But Massaoud warned that there were still ""great needs"" on the ground, with nearly half the population ¨C more than 18 million people, including nearly 10 million children ¨C in need of humanitarian assistance."

Latest COVID-19 wave in China hits film industry once again,"Summer holidays have always been a good time for movie going and thus the film industry in China, but the latest wave of COVID-19 infections in the country is causing some headaches for the cinemas.

A cinema in Xujiahui, one of Shanghai's busiest areas, does not see many audience members these days, although it's being disinfected more frequently than ever according to anti-COVID-19 mandate.

""People want to stay home. And we are strictly following the COVID-19 prevention measures. There's less audience compared with the period before this latest wave of the infections,"" said Qian Zhijun, marketing manager of Shangying Cinema.

While this cinema is lucky to open to the public, many cinemas in China's medium- and high-risk areas, including cities of Yangzhou, Nanjing and Zhengzhou, have suspended operations in accordance with COVID-19 prevention protocols. Meanwhile, occupancy rates in cinemas that are still open remain capped at 75 percent each session."
"COVID-19 causes Chinese box office plunge, summer movie release delays","China's weekly box office has witnessed a continuous drop in the past two weeks as the country tightens prevention measures at cinemas as a result of the recent COVID-19 resurgence.

Movie theaters in over 100 medium- and high-risk areas across the country have been asked to suspend operations, and those in low-risk areas currently allow 75 percent of the maximum capacity, according to the China Film Administration.

Action film ""Raging Fire"" continued to dominate the domestic box office last week (August 9-15), raking in over 258 million yuan ($40 million), data from the online ticketing platform Maoyan showed. The film accounted for over half of last week's total.

The movie was directed by late Hong Kong filmmaker Benny Chan, who is famous for Jackie Chan-starring blockbuster ""New Police Story"" (2004). Starring celebrated action stars Donnie Yen and Nicholas Tse, the film focuses on a story about a police hunt for a gang of drug traffickers.

Chinese romantic comedy ""Upcoming Summer"" came in second with $13 million, followed by animated film ""White Snake 2: The Tribulation of the Green Snake,"" which garnered $8 million."

Kris Wu, a Chinese-Canadian pop idol, has been arrested on suspicion of rape, police in Beijing's Chaoyang District said in a statement on Monday.

The 30-year-old singer faces a series of sexual abuse accusations from 19-year-old student Du Meizhu. Wu was previously detained by police on July 31.

Wu, who has a huge fan base, violated the bottom line of the law and has caused extremely bad social impacts that cannot be tolerated, the China Association of Performing Arts, the country's largest membership organization of performing arts based in Beijing, said Monday night on China's Twitter-like platform Weibo.

Wu's case has sent out a warning sign to celebrities and entertainment companies alike that entertainers must raise their legal awareness and moral baseline as public figures, the association said.

Tourism brings old town back to life in north China,"02:29

China has declared an end to extreme poverty. Now the government is seeking to inject vitality into poorer rural areas to ensure that people do not fall back into hardship. One way to do that is tourism, which has become a prevailing business in many rural areas across the country. The Qikou Old Town on the outskirts of Lyuliang City in north China's Shanxi Province has risen to prominence among tourists. The town was once a famed trading location along the Yellow River during the Ming (1368-1644) and Qing (1636-1912) dynasties but declined and sank into poverty amid the rise of highway and railway transport. In recent years, local officials have started to encourage villagers to cater to tourists, built transport infrastructure and improved living facilities. Now the town prospers again as tourists flood in.

One of the town's highlights is Lijiashan Village, which dates back to the Ming and Qing dynasties. The distinctive architecture there has been well-preserved. Most are courtyards and cave houses, creating a spectacular view that attracts photographers and culture enthusiasts. Pan Tao is a schoolteacher from east China's Jiangsu Province. He came to visit the village for the first time. ""I'm amazed by the architecture on the loess plateau here,"" he said. ""I've seen that preserving the architecture and improving living standards are not contradictory."" Sixty-year-old Yang Yanmei's old house often attracts many visitors. In the past, she and her husband made a living by farming. Now as more tourists come, they have transformed their old house into a homestay. Yang has also become a tour guide and also performs folk shows for tourists. In peak season, she has earned up to 2,000 yuan ($309) in a day.

Evergrande Real Estate to make yuan bond coupon payment on time,"Evergrande Group, China's second largest developer, announced on Wednesday it would make an annual interest payment on its domestic yuan bonds on time.

Evergrande's main unit, Evergrande Real Estate, said in a filing with the Shenzhen Stock Exchange that it would make the coupon payment totaling 232 million yuan ($35.88 million) on its 5.8 percent September 2025 bond due September 23.

The announcement comes as Evergrande inches closer to a key deadline for an interest payment on a dollar bond.

The move is expected to soothe investors' fears of default by the indebted group, which had more than $300 billion in liabilities as of the end of June, the company's earnings report showed in August.

It owes $669 million in interest through the end of this year, including $83.5 million in a coupon payment also due September 23 on a dollar bond, Bloomberg reported.

10 Key points from Xi's address to the UN General Assembly,"Chinese President Xi Jinping addressed the United Nations General Assembly Tuesday. Here are 10 points from his speech.

1. The history of world civilization is one of fighting pandemics. Rising to challenges, humanity has always emerged in triumph and achieved greater development and advancement. The current pandemic may appear overwhelming, but humanity will surely overcome it and prevail.

2. Staying committed to development as a priority:

¡°We need to put development high on the global macro policy agenda, strengthen policy coordination among major economies, and ensure policy continuity, consistency and sustainability. We need to foster global development partnerships that are more equal and balanced, forge greater synergy among multilateral development cooperation processes, and speed up the implementation of the U.N. 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.¡±

3. Staying committed to a people-centered approach:

¡°We should safeguard and improve people¡¯s livelihoods and protect and promote human rights through development, and make sure that development is for the people and by the people, and that its fruits are shared among the people. We should continue our work so that the people will have a greater sense of happiness, benefit and security, and achieve well-rounded development.¡±

4. Staying committed to benefits for all:

¡°We should care about the special needs of developing countries. We may employ such means as debt suspension and development aid to help developing countries, particularly vulnerable ones facing exceptional difficulties, with emphasis on addressing unbalanced and inadequate development among and within countries.¡±

5. Staying committed to innovation-driven development:

¡°We need to seize the historic opportunities created by the latest round of technological revolution and industrial transformation, redouble efforts to harness technological achievements to boost productivity, and foster an open, fair, equitable and non-discriminatory environment for the development of science and technology.

7. Staying committed to results-oriented actions:¡°We need to increase input in development, advance on a priority basis cooperation on poverty alleviation, food security, COVID-19 response and vaccines, development financing, climate change and green development, industrialization, digital economy and connectivity, among other areas, and accelerate implementation of the U.N. 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, so as to build a global community of development with a shared future.

China has pledged an additional $3 billion of international assistance in the next three years to support developing countries in responding to COVID-19 and promoting economic and social recovery.¡±

8. ¡°A world of peace and development should embrace civilizations of various forms, and must accommodate diverse paths to modernization. Democracy is not a special right reserved to an individual country, but a right for the people of all countries to enjoy.¡±

9. ¡°One country¡¯s success does not have to mean another country¡¯s failure, and the world is big enough to accommodate common development and progress of all countries.¡±

10. ¡°China is always a builder of world peace, contributor to global development, defender of the international order and provider of public goods. China will continue to bring the world new opportunities through its new development.¡±

Ethiopia: Chinese-built industrial park generates 114 mln USD revenue,"A worker walks at the Hawassa Industrial Park in Hawassa town, 275 kilometers south of Addis Ababa, capital of Ethiopia, July 13, 2016. /Xinhua

Ethiopia's flagship Chinese-built Hawassa Industrial Park on Tuesday announced 114 million U.S. dollars revenue from the export of face masks to the international market.

The reported revenue was generated from the export of face masks mainly to the U.S. and European markets during the recently concluded Ethiopian fiscal year, state-run Ethiopian News Agency (ENA) quoted Fitsum Ketema, General Manager of Hawassa Industrial Park, as saying.

Despite the hardships created by the COVID-19 pandemic, companies operating inside the premises of the industrial park were able to mitigate the economic impact of the pandemic through the production and export of high-quality face-masks and related products, according to the general manager.

Hawassa Industrial Park, which the Ethiopian government considers as a model for the construction of other industrial zones across the country, has proved successful immediately after its inauguration in July 2016 by attracting various world-class textile and apparel companies to the East African country.

The industrial park was built by China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation (CCECC).

The Ethiopian government has previously disclosed its plan to generate close to 1 billion U.S. dollars in annual revenue from the park once it starts operations at its full potential.

As part of its efforts to make the country a light manufacturing hub and lower-middle income economy by 2025, the East African country hopes its plan to build and commission a total of 30 industrial parks within the same period."

Egypt's Suez Canal Authority (SCA) on Tuesday said the revenues of the canal in the first eight months of 2021 rose by 11.6 percent year on year to 4.09 billion U.S. dollars. /Xinhua

Egypt's Suez Canal Authority (SCA) on Tuesday said the revenues of the canal in the first eight months of 2021 rose by 11.6 percent year on year to 4.09 billion U.S. dollars.

Some 13,317 vessels crossed the canal from January to August in 2021 compared with 12,482 ships a year ago, up by 6.7 percent, the SCA said in a statement.

The increase in revenues came as the SCA has been implementing a plan to widen and deepen the southern part of the canal.

The Suez Canal is a major lifeline for global seaborne trade since it allows ships to travel between Europe and South Asia without navigating around Africa, thereby reducing the sea voyage distance by about 7,000 km.

Some 12 percent of the world trade volume passes through the man-made canal, a major source of hard currency in Egypt."
China edges closer to top 10 most innovative economies: WIPO,"China is still the only middle-income economy in the list of the world's top 30 most innovative economies, establishing itself as a global innovation leader and approaching the top 10, according to a report released by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) on Monday.

WIPO's Global Innovation Index (GII) 2021 report shows that China has made continuous progress from ranking 14th last year to 12th this year and is now ""knocking at the door of the GII top 10,"" which ""underlines the continued importance of governmental policies and incentives to stimulate innovation.""

Since 2013, China has moved up the GII ranks consistently and steadily, establishing itself as a global innovation leader.

According to the GII, the number of China's patents by origin, scaled by GDP, is higher than those of Japan, Germany and the U.S., and is even more impressive when considered in absolute terms. The same is true for the number of trademarks and industrial designs by origin as a percentage of GDP.

In terms of innovation clusters geographically, the top 10 list remains the same as last year with only minor shifts. Shenzhen-Hong Kong-Guangzhou and Beijing now rank second and third, respectively, after the Tokyo-Yokohama cluster in Japan. Shanghai ranks eighth. Of the top 100 clusters, China has 19.

Published annually, the GII provides performance measures and ranks 132 economies on their innovation ecosystems. As in past years, Switzerland, Sweden, the U.S. and the UK continue to lead the innovation ranking. Other countries in the GII top 10 include South Korea, the Netherlands, Finland, Singapore, Denmark and Germany.

According to WIPO Director General Daren Tang, ""in spite of the massive impact of the COVID-19 pandemic ... many sectors have shown remarkable resilience, especially those that have embraced digitalization, technology and innovation.""

""As the world looks to rebuild from the pandemic, we know that innovation is integral to overcoming the common challenges that we face and to constructing a better future,"" he said."

U.S. airlines will benefit from the Biden administration's decision on Monday to reopen the country to fully-vaccinated air travelers from around the world, experts said, but the outlook for lucrative business travel was less certain. Lifting restrictions will allow tens of thousands of foreign nationals to fly to the United States. It also gives the big three air carriers, American Airlines, United Airlines and Delta Air Lines, a chance to recover part of their trans-Atlantic business. Moody's Investors Service estimates the White House decision would result in a ""stronger"" operating cash flow at U.S. airlines in the next six months. Trans-Atlantic flights accounted for 11 percent to 17 percent of their 2019 passenger revenues. Overall, international travel generated 26 percent to 38 percent of revenue for the three airlines in 2019, said Colin Scarola, vice president of equity research at CFRA Research.

Scarola added, ""The international category has been the one that really hasn't recovered much at all."" The lifting of restrictions coincides with the onset of the winter season, historically a lean period for international travel. Scarola said the decision would encourage companies to approve overseas business trips, yet the fight against COVID-19 was more important and he does not expect international travel to rebound to pre-pandemic levels before late 2022. CEO Doug Parker said American Airlines was ""looking forward to welcoming more customers back to easy, seamless international trips for business, for leisure, and to reconnect with family and friends."" In early September, U.S. airline passenger volumes for international travel were just 44 percent of the pre-pandemic levels, according to data from Airlines for America, an industry trade group.

Savanthi Syth, an analyst at Raymond James, called the White House's decision an ""incremental positive"" that would give U.S. carriers clarity for next year's summer travel season. Yet it did not prompt her to revise her financial estimates for them or the outlook for air travel. ""While this is a net positive, you have to kind of counterbalance it with what's happening in the U.S.,"" she said, referring to warnings from airlines this month about the financial hit from the fast-spreading Delta variant of the coronavirus. Several airlines have slashed revenue forecasts, citing a slowdown in bookings and increased cancellations. The resurgence in cases has also stalled a pickup in business travel, a cash cow for airlines with a round-trip business class ticket for a Chicago-New York United flight nearly triple the price of economy class. Syth expects domestic business travel to remain below the 2019 levels at least until late 2022. International business travel is not expected to recover before 2024, she said.

Democratic congressional leaders on Monday unveiled plans to suspend the nation's borrowing limit, following a White House warning of ""economic catastrophe"" unless that ceiling is raised.

The legislation also would fund the government through the end of the year after the current budget lapses on September 30.

But the fate of the plan is unclear since Republicans have vowed to withhold support for raising the debt ceiling, which is needed to fund spending already approved by lawmakers, including the massive rescue packages rolled out during the COVID-19 pandemic.

""The American people expect our Republican colleagues to live up to their responsibilities and make good on the debts they proudly helped incur,"" Democratic Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a joint statement.

They warned that ""a reckless Republican-forced default could plunge the country into a recession.""

Democrats have the majority in both houses of Congress, but the slim margin in the Senate means they will need some Republican support to push it through, since a single Senator can block any legislation that has less than 60 votes.

The measure would suspend the debt limit through December 2022 ¨C after the mid-term congressional elections.

It also would keep the government running through the end of the year while legislators continue to debate two massive spending bills ¨C an eight-year, $1.2 trillion infrastructure package and a 10-year, $3.5 trillion package with a host of social programs, largely paid for by rolling back tax cuts.

Schumer and Pelosi said the measure unveiled Monday would avoid ""an unnecessary government shutdown,"" and called it ""must-pass legislation.""

It will also include funds for disaster relief and Afghan evacuee resettlement, with the White House asking for $20 billion for hurricane and wildfire aid and $6 billion for tens of thousands of Afghan refugees.

""We look forward to passing this crucial legislation with bipartisan support through both chambers and sending to the president's desk in the coming weeks,"" they said.

But Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell once again said Democrats should go it alone.

""They just want bipartisan cover so they can pivot as fast as possible to ramming through an historically reckless taxing and spending spree on a pure party-line vote,"" he said on Twitter.

That is a stark contrast from his position in 2019, when Republican Donald Trump was president and McConnell argued that failing to raise the borrowing cap ""would be a disaster.""

U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has warned that without an increase the government will run out of cash to fund operations and pay its debts sometime in October.

Failing to raise the debt limit ""would produce widespread economic catastrophe"" and ""compound the damage of the continuing public health emergency,"" she said Monday."
Troubled Evergrande's EV arm gives out share options to boost morale,"The electric vehicle (EV) arm of China's second largest developer Evergrande Group, which is currently under serious liquidity crisis, has given a total of 323.7 million share options to its directors and employees, said a filing on Tuesday.

Three independent non-executive directors and around 3,180 employees, mostly research and development staff, of China Evergrande New Energy Vehicle were granted the share options. They will be available to exercise from March 20 next year at HK$3.9 ($0.5) per share, 34 percent higher than the EV maker's closing share price HK$2.9 on Tuesday.

The company's share price was down 90.5 percent so far this year.

The share options, described by local media as a Mid-Autum Festival gift to Evergrande employees, are worth about HK$1.26 billion, equivalent to 3.31 percent of the capital of the company's current issued shares. China Evergrande New Energy Vehicle said it is to ""promote and support the company's development"" and ""ensure the interests of the group's long-term development stability."""
Honda says domestic output at 40% capacity in August-September,"Honda Motor said its car factories in Japan have been operating at 40 percent capacity in August and September because of shortages of semiconductors and other components caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

In a press release on its website, Honda said production should rebound to 70 percent capacity in early October.

""We are doing what we can to minimize the impact on production, but the situation remains unclear,"" the Japanese company said.

Models affected include the N-BOX, Fit and Odyssey, according to the release.

The release comes on the heels of Toyota Motor's announcement last Friday that 27 out of 28 lines across its 14 plants in Japan would be temporarily suspended for as many as 11 days in October, due to a shortage of components resulted from the resurgent pandemic.

Semiconductor shortages and the delayed packaging and testing of the chips will cause the production of global light vehicles to drop by 6.2 percent, or five million this year, London-based market research firm IHS Markit estimated last Thursday.

The pandemic-induced chip shortage has repeatedly halted auto plant operations and prompted them to scale back delivery targets since the end of 2020.

IHS Markit also downgraded the production forecast of global light vehicles by 9.3 percent to 82.6 million units in 2022, citing supply chain challenges.

Oil giant Shell sets sights on sustainable aviation fuel take-off,"Royal Dutch Shell plans to start producing low-carbon jet fuel at scale by 2025 to encourage the world's airlines to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

Aviation, accounting for 3 percent of the world's carbon emissions, is considered one of the toughest sectors to tackle due to a lack of alternative technologies to jet fueled-engines.

Shell, one of the world's largest oil traders, said it aims to produce 2 million tonnes of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) by 2025, a tenfold increase from today's total global output.

Produced from waste cooking oil, plants and animal fats, SAF could cut up to 80 percent of aviation emissions, Shell said.

Shell, which at present only supplies SAF produced by others, including Finnish refiner Neste, said on Monday it wants green jet fuel, which can be blended with regular aviation fuel with little need to change plane engines, to make up 10 percent of its global aviation fuel sales by 2030.

SAF accounts for less than 0.1 percent of today's global aviation fuel demand, which reached around 330 million tonnes in 2019, investment bank Jefferies said.

Growing the market faces several hurdles, primarily due to the cost of SAF, which is currently up to 8 times higher than regular jet fuel, and the limited availability of feedstock.

Shell plans to build a biofuels processing plant at its Rotterdam refinery with an annual capacity of 820,000 tonnes, with SAF set to make up more than half of the output. The plant is expected to start production in 2024.

In a new report on the decarbonisation of aviation published together with Deloitte, Shell called for the sector to cut its emissions to net zero by 2050."

Concerns that a potential hike in corporate taxes could eat into earnings also weighed on markets, as leading Democrats sought to raise the top tax rate on corporations to 26.5 percent from the current 21 percent.

""We anticipate large cap volatility as changes to U.S. corporate tax rates play a role going forward as the two sides negotiate, particularly for the 'low tax' sectors implicated such as tech and biotech, and companies with hefty international revenues,"" Dudley said.

Focus is now on a meeting of the Federal Reserve next week, with investors debating if a batch of strong economic data this week could spur the bank into shortening its timeline for reducing monetary stimulus.

Thursday's data showing an unexpected rise in retail sales came on the heels of a steady factory activity reading and a cooling in inflation, suggesting the U.S. economic recovery was resilient despite a recent rise in cases of the Delta COVID-19 variant.

Treasury yields also rose on the data, indicating increased optimism over the economy as investors sold safe-haven bonds.

At 11:48 a.m. eastern time, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 168.97 points, or 0.49 percent , to 34,580.72, the S&P 500 lost 31.57 points, or 0.71 percent, to 4,442.18 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 146.08 points, or 0.96 percent, to 15,035.68.

Analysts said the S&P 500 was trading close to its 50-day moving average, which tends to be a big support for the index. Essentially, Friday's losses could lead to a rebound next week.

The simultaneous expiration of stock options, stock index futures and index options contracts later in the day, known as triple witching, is also expected to cause volatility through the trading session.

Beijing Stock Exchange opens for investor registration,"Investors can make appointments to trade on the Beijing Stock Exchange from Friday, the bourse announced in a notice.

The access threshold for individual investors is 500,000 yuan ($77,458) in securities assets, and there is no capital threshold requirement for institutional investors.

After the stock market opens, the entry threshold for individual investors will be average daily securities assets of 500,000 yuan in the 20 trading days prior to the opening. A minimum two years of experience in securities trading is also required.

The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) released accommodating regulations to the Beijing bourse on Friday asking for public feedback. The regulations concern issuance of shares, refinancing and supervision.

The CSRC said that the regulations are designed to highlight the characteristics of the Beijing Stock Exchange serving innovative small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).

China announced earlier this month that it will set up a new stock exchange, in its capital Beijing.

The new exchange, which is set to be the third stock exchange on the Chinese mainland after those in Shanghai and Shenzhen, will augment an existing equity market ¨C the ""new third board"" ¨C according to the CSRC.

The ""new third board,"" officially known as the National Equities Exchange and Quotations (NEEQ), was launched in Beijing in 2013. It offers SMEs a financing channel with low costs and simple listing procedures but only allows professional investors to trade equities in those companies.

America's ongoing debt trap,"Credit cards and U.S. dollar notes. /Getty Credit cards and U.S. dollar notes. /Getty

Editor's note: James Rae is a professor at California State University Sacramento. He was also a Fulbright Scholar at Beijing Foreign Studies University from 2017 to 2018. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN. The United States is the world's largest debtor nation, with an accumulated federal debt now topping $28 trillion. While the debt to GDP ratio has been growing once again, and is near a peak, it may be sustainable for now, but growing questions about its future impact are looming.

The ability of the U.S. to maintain its dominant position in global affairs, in both the security and economic realm, depend heavily on the health and management of its domestic affairs. The long-term future competitiveness of the American economy is hard to predict, but runaway debts do not bode well regardless. This issue gins more clarity by the immediacy of America's debt ceiling limit legislation. In 2011, the two major American political parties faced off over the regular extension of the debt ceiling and caused insecurity in financial markets when the small risk of default appeared as a possible reality, as Standard and Poor's ultimately downgraded American sovereign debt. A decade later, we may be headed for a similar reckoning. An agreement reached between both parties to suspend the debt ceiling for two years allowed relatively smooth sailing for the crisis spending agreed upon by both parties during both the Donald Trump and Joe Biden administrations. However, that agreement is due to expire July 31. No deal is prepared in this immediate period, though the U.S. government is estimated to have the budgetary ability to persist in its functions until October or November. Therein is the background, which will then be played out like almost all political issues, in a divisive Congress keen to seek partisan advantage regarding any national debate. Senate Minority Leader, Republican Mitch McConnell pledges not to vote for raising the debt limit and hopes to force the Democratic rivals to raise the limit unilaterally using the procedure known as reconciliation where legislation can be adopted by 50 percent plus one rather than the filibuster-proof majority of 60. This would seek to make Democrats ""own"" the enlarged debt and pressure their caucus on the looming trillion-dollar spending bills.

Graphics: A glance at the world's busiest cargo port in east China,"The Port of Ningbo-Zhoushan in east China's Zhejiang Province stands as the world's busiest port in terms of cargo tonnage since 2009. It handled nearly 1.2 billion tonnes of cargo in 2020, while also serving as China's largest transit hub for iron ore and crude oil.

The port's cargo throughput exceeded one billion tonnes in 2017, the first in the world to cross such a benchmark.

China leads the world in cross-border trade recovery thanks to effective COVID-19 containment efforts. The country's foreign trade rose 1.5 percent to $4.65 trillion in 2020, of which exports came in at $2.59 trillion with a 3.6-percent yearly rise. The throughput of the country's major ports has recovered to the pre-pandemic level. In comparison, global leading ports in Singapore, Rotterdam and Busan recorded decline in trade volume due to drop in demand."
Yuan's gain may slow as fundamentals call for some calms,"Gains in China's yuan may be limited in the near term as more investors may start to be relieved that the currency's rally was a bit too fast in the past few months from the fundamental perspective. Also, the U.S. jobs report may offer some supports for the greenback.

Since the end of the first quarter, the yuan has rallied around 3 percent as China's economy has been showing persistent recovery after the pandemic, plus a weaker dollar profile. The fundamentals will continue to support the yuan with no visible depreciation pressure appearing at this moment. But certain clues indicate the pace of gains may slow down in the coming months.

The country's lenders will need to hold 7 percent of their foreign exchange in reserve from June 15, the People's Bank of China (PBOC) said in a statement on Monday. The size of the increase is 2 percentage points, and it is the first hike since 2007. The moves aim to curb the dollar liquidity as it reduces the supply of the dollar. The tighter dollar liquidity is considered to be possible to put some negative impact on the yuan.

The tweak in reserve requirement itself may have a limited direct impact on the Chinese yuan since the yuan interest rate is much higher than dollar rates. However, the message here is clear: the monetary authority may not be comfortable with recent quick gains. Some market participants who have been betting the excessive gains in yuan may start abandoning their earlier forecasts, as they could be worried that any further massive gains in yuan may cause more measures from the central bank.

And there are valid reasons for the Chinese monetary authorities to curb the excessive gains in yuan. Data released on Monday showed that China's new export orders index for the month of May fell below 50, the first time since February, suggesting the recent rising currency may have badly hurt the exporters' revenues. The CFETS RMB Index, a gauge to reflect the yuan's value against a basket of currencies, is now rising to the highest level since 2016. It may trigger the PBOC to set the yuan fixing rates weaker than expected in the near future.

On the other hand, the recent China-U.S. bond yield spread also shows that some gains in yuan could be excessive. Over a long period of time, moves in yuan versus the dollar have been in tandem with the two countries' bond yield gap. The 10-year bond yield spread between the two countries narrowed by about 50 bps in the past six months to 145 bps now, close to the level in February 2020, when the USD/CNY exchange rate stood around 6.95. Thus, the yuan upside could be limited at this stage if the yield spread between the two continues to shrink.

Based on the experience in the past five years after the PBOC reformed the yuan fixing regime, the yuan's direction has been influencing the cross-board capital flows. The rising yuan will definitely help to attract more capital inflows, boosting prices for the onshore yuan-denominated assets and further pushing forward the yuan internationalization progress.

However, if the pace of inflows is too quick, it would pose potential risks for the financial system stabilization once the Fed decides to tighten the monetary policies because some of those international ""hot cash"" with speculative nature would fight back into the dollar assets. Hence, it's necessary for the central bank to monitor the current onshore dollar liquidity in order to avoid keep the liquidity balanced.

On the dollar side, the dollar index seems to be gaining some support near the 90 levels, further downside room is seen as limited as long as the U.S. economic data shows no signs of deterioration. The labor market report to be released this Friday would be extremely crucial for all kinds of traders, as this would be the last top-tier economic data released before the next Federal Open Market Committee meeting in the middle of the month.

We expect the Fed to ""openly"" discuss the details or schedule of a tapering of the quantitative easing if the upcoming non-farm payrolls data stays above 600,000. If this happened, the 10-year Treasury yield may quickly rise to above the 1.8 percent level and push the dollar higher."
Biden faces limited appetite from allies in confronting China,"Editor's note: Nathan Sheets is a chief economist at PGIM Fixed Income. He was the under secretary of the U.S. Treasury for International Affairs between 2014-2017. Previously, he also worked at the Federal Reserve for 18 years, most recently as director of the Division of International Finance and FOMC Economist. The article reflects the author's opinion, and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

One of the first things that new U.S. Presidential Administrations tend to learn is the difference between campaigning and governing. Candidates spin out proposals and position papers but, once in power, implementing even a fraction of them becomes a near-herculean task.

Of course, given Joe Biden's long career in Washington, including eight years as Vice President, this hardly comes as a surprise to him. Moreover, his first major legislative initiative in the form of a large fiscal package sailed through Congress in record time.

But where the new Administration seems to be getting a reality check is in the sphere of foreign policy. Secretary of State Antony Blinken's rocky summit in Alaska with his Chinese counterparts grabbed the headlines, but the emerging challenges seem more deeply rooted.

Through the election campaign, Biden and other Democrats thumped Donald Trump for the unilateral tendencies of his foreign policy. Trump had little patience with the thrust and parry of international negotiations. He preferred to use tools directly under his control, such as tariffs and sanctions.

A key plank of Biden's platform was that Trump's unilateral moves were destabilizing the globe. And the United States could achieve better outcomes working with allies, such as Europe, Japan and Australia. This was particularly true for efforts with China.

While it's still early days for the new administration, this effort to find common cause on China is facing some headwinds. The most critical of these is gaining the full participation of the European Union ¨C the early soundings from Europe's capitals have been cautious.

In late December, as the Biden Administration was preparing to take office, the EU inked a comprehensive agreement on investment with China. While the pact arguably only brought Europe to parity with the U.S. Phase 1 deal, some observers saw it as a signal that Europe's appetite to challenge China has limits.

A joint effort to pressure China could put Europe's commercial interests at risk. Germany, in particular, is geared to the Chinese export market. Moreover, the domestic engines of European growth are lackluster and, as a result, Europe is reliant on external demand.

Confronting China is thus a difficult proposition for the Europeans. Some of this reluctance may yield to cajoling from the Biden Administration, but the differences in perspective are likely to remain consequential.

Europe's reluctance may also reflect a more fundamental issue. Renewed global engagement from the Biden Administration has been welcomed by countries around the world. Indeed, as Antony Blinken recently said ¨C the United States is back and aims to be a constructive partner. But the reception to date has been less jubilant than might have been expected.

Perhaps this reflects that national leaders are busy fighting the coronavirus, so their energies are more domestically directed than usual. But the response may also reflect concerns about how durable this renewed U.S. partnership will be.

As countries consider joining the Biden Administration's efforts on China, they must ask themselves which of the last two election outcomes ¨C 2016 or 2020 ¨C is a better measure of the American electorate over the longer term? While the political winds are now blowing strongly in Biden's direction, the uncertainties are clearly significant. In contrast, the trajectory of China's policies is clear.

For the Biden Administration, these observations highlight the challenges of framing new approaches to U.S. foreign policy that are fresh, intuitive, and consistent with their values. What's clear is that they reject much of Trump's strategy and tactics. But by the same token, the world has changed appreciably since 2016, so rolling back the clock and running plays from the Obama Administration is also inadequate.

Biden's team will need to continue its efforts to hammer out a ""third way"" on an array of issues. Certainly, this includes China. But it also includes Russia, Turkey, DPRK, Iran, and much more. It is no small undertaking. And it will require time. The problem, of course, is that the ongoing flow of global events is unlikely to allow much breathing space.

CGTN Explains: Understanding China's carbon market,"After running pilot projects at the local level for over a decade, China officially launched its long-awaited national carbon emissions trading market on Friday.

According to China's Ministry of Ecology and Environment (MEE), China's Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) has replaced the EU's as the world's largest emissions trading system.

Here's everything you need to know about China's carbon market.

What is a carbon market?

A carbon market is where greenhouse gas emitters can buy and sell greenhouse gas emissions permits or allowances.

The government sets the cap on the total amount of carbon emissions for the year, then companies receive or buy emissions quotas within the cap. A company must provide enough allowances to cover all its emissions yearly or face a fine. They can trade carbon emission allowances with one another on the trading platform.

In China's ETS, the majority of the allowances are given to emitters for free; however, in most of the other carbon markets, they are purchased.

Also, China's version targets intensity rather than capping emissions.

In the EU and U.S. versions, an overall cap is set on the number of carbon credits. This is the amount of carbon the signatories of the agreement are happy to emit over a given period. China's scheme will set benchmarks for each separate power plant, which will vary between facilities. As before, those that do not exceed their quota can sell it to those that do.

Who's involved?

In the first phase, the system only covers the power sector. Over 2,000 power companies, emitting more than 4 billion tonnes of greenhouse gases per year or 40 percent of the country's yearly total, have participated.

According to MEE, seven more high energy-intensive industries, including iron and steel and construction materials, will be covered by the carbon market in the future.

Why build a carbon market?

The country is trying to use the trading scheme to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, as part of its effort to peak its emissions by 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060.

""For the first time, the responsibility for controlling greenhouse gas emissions at the national level is left to the enterprises,"" said an earlier statement released by the MEE.

What's the price?

Carbon pricing is a crucial component in deciding how effectively the carbon market can help reduce carbon emissions.

The first deal in China's ETS was sealed at 52.78 yuan ($8.16) per tonne, with a total of 160,000 tonnes of emissions worth 7.9 million yuan traded while the average carbon price on the European Union ETS between 2021-2025 is 47.25 euros ($55.67) a tonne, according to a survey by the International Emissions Trading Association.

Explainer: Why are there so many spectacular highways in China?,"Normally, it looks like a straight wide two-way road with many cars run on.

What do you think an expressway looks like?

So, why does China have so many mega highways?

The country has the world's highest expressway Beipanjiang Bridge, and the world's longest desert highway, spanning from its capital city Beijing to the far western region of Xinjiang. The country is also home to the longest sea-crossing bridge, the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge.

The first reason is geographical complexity. The third largest country owns a territory of 9.6 million square kilometers, with different geographical conditions, meaning that expressways can be above ground, through mountains or even under water.

In south China's Guizhou Province, where the Beipanjiang Bridge is located, over 90 percent of its land is mountainous and its average altitude is more than 1,000 meters. More than 20,000 bridges connect traffic in the mountains and there are barely any plains in the region.

To build roads there, you must tackle bridges and tunnels instead.

Besides mountains, deserts, rivers, jungles and coastlines have all made China's highways very diversified.

The second decisive factor for China to build these roads comes from its economic and technological power.

China has been building highways at an amazing high speed. Since 1988, when the country's first expressway ¨C the Shanghai-Jiading Expressway was completed, China has built over 160,000 kilometers in expressways, which is the most of any country in the world.

The reason behind this efficiency is China's economic model. Nearly all of the highways were built by state-owned enterprises (SOEs), meaning that should the country need this, they can be built at once.

State-owned giants do not have to consider the financial returns of these projects, because the SOEs backed by the government, shoulder the responsibilities of promoting development in poor areas.

So, no matter how isolated and rural a place is, infrastructure building is aligned with the needs of the people.

And that's essentially why so many mega projects have come true in China.

Carbon emissions trading explained: How will the UK system work?,"The UK is about to launch its own carbon trading system, with a first auction of permits on May 19. It replaces the European Union Emissions Trading System (ETS), the world's first and biggest carbon trading market, of which the country had been part until leaving the bloc. The scheme is part of the UK efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and become a net-zero economy by 2050.

Carbon trading puts a price on a country or company's carbon emissions to encourage a reduction in greenhouse gases. /Reuters/Shamil Zhumatov/File Carbon trading puts a price on a country or company's carbon emissions to encourage a reduction in greenhouse gases. /Reuters/Shamil Zhumatov/File

What is carbon trading? Carbon trading is a market-based system that allows companies and governments to buy and sell permits and credits to emit carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. It emerged as a direct result of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol calling for a united front to reduce pollutant emissions, carbon trading is technically a market practice that punishes big polluters and rewards those who cut back on emissions. The most commonly used and considered most efficient carbon trading model is the so-called ""cap and trade"" scheme. It sets an overall limit or ""cap"" on the amount of greenhouse gas emissions, which industries and companies have to respect. Though issues of corruption and a set of different issues have emerged in connection with the system, carbon trading is a measure increasingly being adopted to slow down the rates of emission.

How does it work? Almost all carbon trading schemes use the ""cap and trade"" principle mentioned above. In such as scheme, governments usually set a legal limit on emissions over a specific period of time and give away a number of emissions allowances to those companies responsible for CO2 emissions, either free or auctioned. One permit equals about one ton of CO2 equivalent released into the atmosphere. At the moment in the EU, prices are around 56 euros ($68) a ton. The UK, unlike the EU, has set a legal minimum price of 22 pounds ($31) a ton. Technically, if a company ""spends"" all its available credits but still emits more CO2 than its permits can cover, the company will be forced to buy carbon credits from a less-polluting company to cover its exceeding emissions, or pay a heavy fine. Companies that save up their allowances can keep them to cover future needs or sell them to companies that are running short of them. This system puts a price on emissions ¨C something that should encourage companies to become greener and represents an incentive for those companies that, by reducing their emissions, are able to sell their credits to big polluters and make a profit out of it.

Despite controversies around carbon trading, there's no sizable alternative to this system currently available. /Reuters/Lisi Niesner Despite controversies around carbon trading, there's no sizable alternative to this system currently available. /Reuters/Lisi Niesner

How big is it and who's involved? In a 2020 report the World Bank said there were 31 Emissions Trading Schemes and 30 carbon taxes operating globally, covering 22 percent of the world's greenhouse gas emissions. That's up from just two in 1990, when Finland and Poland introduced carbon taxes. The world's first international carbon trading system was the EU ETS, set up in 2005. It involves more than 10,000 companies from all EU member states plus Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland and covers around 40 percent of the EU's greenhouse gas emissions. On a national level, carbon trading systems are also operating in countries including China, Japan, the U.S., Canada, New Zealand, South Korea and Switzerland. Collaboration between countries for bilateral agreement on international carbon trading schemes are also under way, as between the EU and China.

What are the benefits? Carbon trading systems bring positive results. According to data from the European Commission, companies under the EU ETS reduced emissions by about 35 percent between 2005 and 2019. For governments, cap and trade schemes are now the go-to policy to decrease carbon dioxide emissions, whereas the idea of imposing a carbon tax proves much less popular among businesses.

What's the criticism? Despite its successful results, carbon trading remains somewhat controversial. According to critics of the system, carbon trading is just a distraction and a delay from the real, drastic action needed to tackle the climate crisis: radically cutting emissions through structural changes that will move the world towards a low-carbon economy."
Explainer: Why has China built so many expressways?,"China's expressway network has a total length of 160,000 kilometers, longer than anywhere else in the world. Connecting hundreds of millions of people, it took the country some four decades to build.

But, does China need that many expressways?

The answer is yes, for sure.

In China, there's a saying: ""To get rich, you must build a road first."" Compared to normal roads, efficiency is via expressways.

In 1988, the country's first expressway ¨C Shanghai-Jiading Expressway, was completed and opened to the public. The smooth roads have cut the travel time between the two places in half.

""The express highways can greatly shorten the time distance among regions and accelerate the flow of people, capital, information and knowledge,"" said Li Hongchang, associate professor at Beijing Jiaotong University, in an earlier interview with CGTN, adding ""In particularly for the businessman and cold chain logistics [which] are very sensitive to the time efficiency.""

Besides improving regional connectivity, the network also serves as a strong catalyst to support economic development and urbanization.

The most crowded expressway areas are near China's richest places. The three biggest metropolitan areas, centered Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou, have way more expressways than the rest of the country.

Currently, China's expressway network connects nearly 98.6 percent of cities and regions where the urban population exceeds 200,000, according to China's Ministry of Transport.

And the effort doesn't stop there as officials are vowing to cover all cities and counties with a population exceeding 100,000 by 2035.

But it will not be just about coverage, officials are working to present a ""smart"" road network, or digital infrastructure. It will make use of the big data system ¨C Beidou satellite navigation, through which autonomous driving may not be far away.

Coastal regions in China have emphasized advancing the blue economy over the past years, valuing the significant contribution that the ocean economy makes to the GDP. China's marine economy has maintained stable growth over the past two decades, increasing from 930.2 billion yuan ($144 billion) in 2001 to 8.94 trillion yuan in 2019, with an average annual growth rate of about 13 percent. However, affected by the COVID-19 outbreak and the complex international environment, the gross ocean product of China shrunk by 10.5 percent year on year to 8 trillion yuan in 2020, according to the Ministry of Natural Resources (MNR). China's marine economy consists of three marine economic zones in the north, east and south of the country. The east marine zone, or the East China Sea, encompassing Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Fujian provinces and the Shanghai Municipality, contributed about a half of China's gross ocean product from 2018 to 2020.

Amid the COVID-19 blow, the blue economy in the east zone also experienced a drop along with the entire country, decreasing by 4.1 percent to 3.62 trillion yuan in 2020. During last year, the growth of three industries ¨C coastal and marine tourism, oil and gas and construction ¨C in the east zone were dragged down by COVID-19, while other industries achieved positive growth, the East China Sea Bureau of the MNR said.

COVID-19 stopped the fastest-growing coastal and marine tourism industry, causing it to fall from an 800.9 billion yuan industry in 2019 to 658.2 billion yuan in 2020. The coastal and marine tourism industry, the marine transportation industry and the fishery industry are the pillars of the ocean economy in the east zone, accounting for 50.11 percent, 20.08 percent, and 13.81 percent, respectively, in 2020."

In the central part of China, the city of Changsha, the capital of Hunan Province, is one of many cities that never sleeps."
Graphics: Changsha - an average inland city's catch-up path,"On China's Instagram-like social media platform Xiaohongshu, a landlocked city Changsha, outcompeting metropolises like Shanghai and Beijing, catapulted into the most-searched domestic destination during this year's labor-day holiday. The number of tourists experienced a whopping 130.3-percent year-on-year ascent, according to data released by the local authorities in May. To some extent, online search trends and a jump in the number of tourists validate the city's now-found celebrity. But what's driving the craze is not merely an internet fad but a rising city with rapid economic progress. In 2017, Changsha, the capital of central China's Hunan Province also known for the birthplace of the country's founding father Mao Zedong, has become the 13th member to join China's ""trillion-yuan club,"" a group now consisting of 23 cities with each of its annual GDP exceeding 1 trillion yuan (about $154 billion). Its GDP growth rate jumped to the top spot just two years after being admitted to the club.

For people to better understand what a thriving metropolitan economy looks like, the population size and urbanization rate are non-negligible indicators. The city's population has more than doubled in the past seven decades. The urbanization rate also increased sharply along with the expansion of the non-agriculture population as well as the transformation of economic structure.

During the early days of the new China, from 1950s to 1970s, Changsha's economy was dominated by agricultural and low value-added services. Agriculture output was at the mercy of weather conditions. But with the ""reform and opening-up"" campaign rolling out across the country since 1978, Changsha has gradually transformed into an industrialized city with the manufacturing sector at its core.

At the turn of the millennium, a series of national policies and initiatives aiming to boost the development in central China also contributed to the city's economic structure transformation. The removal of investment restrictions, more favorable tax treatment, and enhanced infrastructure and connectivity to coastal commercial gateways all promoted the flourish of local business, a World Bank working report analyzing Changsha's development shows. At the end of 2018, the number of industrial enterprises whose annual revenue exceeding 20 million yuan (about $3 million) reached almost 3,000. Most of them were in the manufacturing industry, accounting for 97.5 percent of the total companies in the secondary sector.

Besides, Changsha is home to four of the world's top 50 construction machinery manufacturers. Sany, one of China's biggest machinery makers, has even been branded as a model demonstration facility for Beijing's plan to upgrade the national manufacturing industry. According to Hu Henghua, former Secretary of Changsha Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, the city's development lies on the manufacturing industry, their advantage comes from it, and the future growth cannot keep without it. Notably, the city's shining development report card is driven by not only the high-speed but the high-quality. Over the years, the fourth industrial revolution marked by the artificial intelligence and some other cutting-edge technologies has ushered Changsha into a new stage. Those traditional manufacturing tycoons repositioned themselves into intelligence-based companies, transitioning from original equipment manufacturers to service providers. ""The future of the heavy-equipment industry will rely as much on software and data as it does on hardware,"" Sany's Chief Information Officer Pan Ruigang said."

UEFA Euro 2020 is approaching the final, which will take place on Sunday between Italy and England. The tournament this year is a unique one, not only for being the first sporting event held after a one-year delay due to the COVID-19 hit, but also a milestone for Chinese sponsorship in UEFA. Commercial rights are the second-largest revenue source for the UEFA Euro Championship after broadcast rights, with an increased share of the total revenue this year compared to past championships.

Four Chinese companies ¨C Hisense, Alipay, Vivo, and TikTok ¨C are among the 12 sponsors of Euro 2020, making China the largest source of sponsorship for the tournament for the first time. Analysts say it was a smart move for Chinese companies to use this exposure for marketing to China, where there are plenty of Euro 2020 fans, and potential new customers abroad. The increase of Chinese sponsors also presented an interesting relation with the world economic landscape shifts. Top Asian sponsor: China replaces Japan Japanese companies sponsored every Euro Championship from 1992 to 2012, thanks to the country's leading consumer electronics development. During this period, China's economy saw increasing momentum from 1998, with the gross domestic product (GDP) topping $1 trillion for the first time. It surpassed Japan in 2010 to become the second largest economy in the world.

Japanese sponsors have been completely absent in the latest two tournaments in 2016 and 2020, replaced by those from China. In the tournament, three more Chinese companies expanded the sponsor team after Hisense put the first Chinese advertisement in front of football fans worldwide in 2016, which was also the first time in UEFA's 56-year history having a sponsor from the Chinese mainland.

In fact, Euro 2020 is not the first global tournament to see a dramatic shift in the origin of its sponsors. At the 2018 FIFA World Cup Russia, a third of the top sponsors came from China. Besides for China's economy surging over the two decades, with the share of global GDP growing from 3.61 percent in 2000 to 17.38 percent in 2020, other Asian major economies ¨C excluding Japan ¨C also experienced an expansion in the share of global GDP. However, the share of global GDP for European and North American economies shrank during the same time. ""Asia is rapidly overtaking Europe and North America in relative economic power, a trend that will continue for the next decades. A prestigious World Cup sponsorship is a sign of Asia's rising economic power,"" Kalin Anev Janse, CFO and member of the management board of the European Stability Mechanism, observed from the 2018 event.

China to fuel global sponsorship market post COVID-19 Global economies are recovering from COVID-19 at different paces, which will affect where sports sponsorships come from as well as their values, according to Nielsen Sports. China to take an increasingly prominent role in the sponsorship landscape globally, Nielsen Sports expected in a report.

The World Bank said in the latest projection that China's economic growth in 2021 would be 8.5 percent year on year, following 2 percent growth in 2020 as the only major economy seeing positive growth globally."

China's corporates have made further progress in business normalization despite lingering uncertainties, continuously recovering from the COVID shock, according to the latest China CFO survey by UBS China. Among the 531 respondents who are senior corporate executives, fewer of them reported a negative impact from the COVID-19. While there was still 11 percent who said their business has yet back to normal, the number was much lower than 48 percent in a September 2020 survey.

Fewer respondents than before delayed or lowered capital expenditure, or capex, shut down business, laid off workers or cut wages, while more chose to increase hiring and wages, adopt more automation and robotics, and push forward online business, the survey showed. The survey also showed an improved business outlook, with 66 percent of the respondents expected higher year-on-year sales in the second half of 2021. Such a positive estimation was made by only 35 percent for the second half of 2020.

Meanwhile, one-third of the executives forecast a higher profit margin. Estimations on both export and domestic orders also increased, reflecting a continued recovery in global trade and domestics consumption.

For other uncertainties cast, over such as by China-U.S. relations, respondents presented an optimistic outlook. With over a half expecting some existing additional tariffs to be rolled off and 24 percent expecting the status quo, slightly higher than the previous 21 percent. Meanwhile, the proportion reporting a negative impact from the China-U.S. trade friction dropped from 66 percent in the September survey and about 80 percent in earlier surveys to 51 percent."
Explainer: Why China has so many state-owned enterprises,"04:10

China, the world's second largest economy, has the largest number of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in the world ¨C over 150,000. In many other countries, especially in the West, the number of SOEs is much smaller, normally in single digits. According to the Fortune Global 500 list 2020, 117 of the global top 500 companies are based on the Chinese mainland and 91 of those are SOEs. There are 121 companies from the United States in the top 500, but none of them are government-owned.

So, why are there so many SOEs in China? First, history. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, SOEs have played a pivotal role in the economy. The country was under a planned economy for a period of time, which meant that almost all enterprises were entirely owned and controlled by the government. Nothing changed until 1978, when China decided to reform and open up. At the time, China instituted market characteristics to its economic system, calling it a socialist market economy. Since then, more and more Chinese people have created their own businesses. Some scholars, both from China and foreign countries, have suggested privatizing all the SOEs, arguing that guaranteed government support can lead to sloppy money usage and low efficiency.

In the late '90s, China moved to downsize SOEs with a policy called ""Grasping the large and letting the small go,"" which indicates the central government would maintain control over the larger SOEs, and the local government could restructure, privatize or just shut down the smaller ones. With SOEs also facing bankruptcy risks, China's market seemed to become more and more competitive. Some scholars, both from China and foreign countries, have suggested privatizing the SOEs, arguing that guaranteed government support can lead to low efficiency. ""The SOEs themselves are incompatible with the market economy,"" Zhang Weiying, a professor at Peking University, once told Phoenix TV. ""I still think there's only one way out for Chinese SOEs, which is to gradually privatize them.""

What's behind China's declining birth rate?,"China's 7th national population census triggered a new round of discussion about its population structure. According to the latest census, China's total fertility rate, the average number of children that would be born to a woman over her lifetime, has dropped to 1.3. What is sustaining this downward trend?

China is planning to ease the burden on families. Its 14th Five-Year Plan has proposed improvements in the country's social support system, especially infant and child care services.

What makes China a world cryptocurrency mining hub?,"05:22

China's Inner Mongolia's recent proposal to ""clean up and shut down"" all cryptocurrency mining operations by the end of April 2021 gave the already high-flying bitcoin's prices another boost. With comparatively better investment returns than most traditional assets during the COVID-19 pandemic, Bitcoin has been under the spotlight in the financial market. A year ago, one bitcoin would cost about $6,000. However, today, its price hovers around $55,000, nine times what it was year on year, even reaching over $61,000 at one point. China is the world's largest producer of bitcoin, according to data from Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance (CCAF). Inner Mongolia accounted for 7.71 percent of the world's computing power for bitcoin between September 2019 and April 2020, even higher than the United States, which accounted for only 5.29 percent over the same period.

Greater accessibility to hardware Increasing computational difficulties for mining cryptocurrency necessitates the utilization of specialized hardware for strong computing power. For bitcoins, the hardware includes a graphics processing unit (GPU) or an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) miner designed for the sole purpose of mining. A cost structure from a CCAF report comparing Chinese and U.S. miners seems to confirm China's competitive edge in mining-machine acquisition. The report attributed China's competitive edge to the concentration of hardware manufacturers, shorter supply chains and the absence of additional overseas shipping fees.

The CCAF data showed that 52 percent of ASIC manufacturers' total sales went to Chinese miners in 2019, dwarfing other regions, while 12 percent went to the U.S. and 9 percent Canada.

Energy-hungry mining Besides capital expenditures, electricity costs comprise the lion's share of miners' operational expenditure. According to the CCAF's estimation, bitcoin mining's annualized electricity consumption is near 140 terawatt-hours, more than that of entire countries, such as Argentina and the Netherlands. Hydropower is the number one source of energy for miners worldwide, followed by coal and natural gas. Asia-Pacific miners equally rely on coal and hydropower. Renewable energy is still much less adopted as a power source."
What attracts companies in expanding business in B&R countries?,"China's economic transactions with countries in the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) remained robust despite the COVID-19 pandemic, with the trade volume jumping 27.5 percent year-on-year in the first half of 2021.

Country-led mega investments in building highways and power plants, as well as private investments, have both contributed in advancing cross-regional cooperation. Apart from trade in goods, companies are investing in the services sector in Belt and Road (B&R) countries.

Countries along the B&R have a strong appetite for services exports from China as they share many economic and trade ties, Zhang Jianming, chairman of Minyoun Hospitality and a member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) told CGTN on the sidelines of the China International Fair for Trade in Services (CIFTIS).

Zhang added that tourist attractions in B&R countries cater to a growing number of Chinese tourists looking for exotic beauty, and demand for business travel in these countries is also expanding.

Minyoun Hospitality, which primarily engages in the hotel business, has assets under management of 45 billion yuan ($7 billion). The group inked a deal with the Silk Road Samarkand Touristic Center at CIFTIS, providing construction technology and management services to two in-building hotels in the Silk Road Samarkand tourist complex.

Famous for its mosques and mausoleums, Samarkand is the second-largest city in Uzbekistan and serves as an important cultural site on the ancient Silk Road.

However, conducting business across borders comes with many uncertainties, Zhang noted, cautioning about the political and legal risks in expanding business overseas.

The following are excerpts from the interview, edited for brevity and clarity.

CGTN: What is the just-signed deal with Uzbekistan about?

Zhang: The deal concerns the Samarkand Hotel Cluster. We'll send personnel, and use the Minyoun brand to manage local hotels. It belongs to the category of services exports.

CGTN: Is there a great demand for services trading in BRI countries?

Zhang: Countries along the Belt and Road are very keen to import this kind of services from China because they share many economic and trade networks with China. So the BRI is also a main development focus of Minyoun.

CGTN: Is the deal denominated in RMB?

Zhang: Yes, there were options for USD-denominated transactions and RMB-denominated transactions in the signing process. We decided to trade in RMB as the currency is increasingly being used in international clearing and settlement. It's convenient, and also demonstrates our support and confidence in using RMB in settlements.

CGTN: How long will it take the sector to recover to pre-pandemic levels?

Zhang: In the three months of May, June and July this year, hotels in our operation area returned to the level of 2019. But it soon fell again because of the resurgence of cases, so we can't make a specific prediction on when we'll fully recover. But we're confident that with China's stringent pandemic control effort, it will take a relatively short time to recover. Also, the ""retaliatory consumption"" after the pandemic will positively influence the industry.

Interview: How Lenovo handles global supply crunch amid the pandemic,"The COVID-19 pandemic has wreaked havoc on world trade and led to a shortage of components, creating trouble for manufactures across the globe. Personal computer makers have been scrambling to secure supplies to meet the surge in demand as remote work and education got a massive boost during the pandemic.

The world's top PC maker, Lenovo managed to produce more than 20 million computers for the past three quarters in a row. While major competitors Dell and HP recently reported quarterly net income growth of 42 percent and 51 percent, respectively, Lenovo's net income surged 119 percent for its latest quarter.

Guan Wei, senior vice president of Lenovo and head of its global supply chain, told CGTN that its hybrid supply chain model and arrangement before the pandemic has helped it through the storm. This model differs from its main competitors, which rely on contract manufactures.

""Other PC makers often hire other parties to design and produce computers for them and sell the products under their own brands,"" Guan Wei told CGTN on the sidelines of the 2021 China International Fair for Trade in Services. He said that Lenovo does this as well as in-house manufacturing.

HP is approaching component suppliers instead of counting on contract manufacturers, the company's Chief Executive Officer Enrique Lores noted as the company released a quarterly earnings report in August.

Lores added that HP is altering chip designs so that they can be applied to multiple hardware models.

Guan admitted that a severe chip shortage is going on for the computer manufacturing industries, which also affects Lenovo. But the company has been effectively minimizing the impact.

""We had more than 38 million laptops made in LCFC last year, which makes up for about 65 percent of Lenovo's global sales,"" said Guan.

He added Lenovo directly deals with many of the components' supplier to the plant which gives it a priority in securing supplies when encounters disruptions.

LCFC (Hefei) Electronic Technology, set up in east China's Anhui Province a decade ago, serves as Lenovo's largest personal computer manufacturing base.

Guan said that Lenovo's arrangements before the pandemic also helped. It has in 2019 designated a committee to assess supply chain risks and launched the digital transformation in 2017.

'Dual circulation'

""We make use of our global resources, such as research and development, design, procurement, but when it comes down to manufacturing, we still focus on China,"" said Guan.

Lenovo makes 90 percent of its products in China and exports some of those to overseas markets. Take the Brazilian market for an example, the company would ship the made-in-China components to its Brazilian factory for assembly and localization in avoidance of paying much higher tariffs on end products.

Commenting on China's manufacturing industry, Guan cautioned that the sector is huge but still not very strong.

He added that China's intelligent manufacturing, rather than pure mass production, will develop gradually, accompanied by the country's 'dual circulation' strategy.

The strategy refers to an economic development pattern that takes domestic development as the mainstay, with domestic and international development reinforcing each other.

Guan said that Lenovo has actually been implementing this strategy in a few aspects for some time and will continue to follow this path.

Going forward, Guan said the company aims to ""excel"" the practice of intelligent manufacturing in China before extending it to overseas factories."
Xpeng: China's EV industry bracing for a knockout round,"Thousands of electric vehicle makers have sprung up in the past few years in China, the world's largest market for this new energy trend.

Competition is tough.

Most of these start-ups will die eventually, and only a few will survive, according to He Xiaopeng, the chairman and CEO of one of China's top EV makers, Xpeng. To survive, the company is betting on smart technologies such as autopilot, which He believes will provide it with an edge to eventually conquer the domestic and international markets.

It's a crucial period for the 7-year-old EV maker. With fast-growing deliveries, the company's gross margins reached 11.2 percent for the first quarter, compared with negative 4.8 percent for the same period in 2020 and 7.4 percent in Q4 last year. The company delivered 13,340 cars in the first quarter, representing an increase of 487.4 percent from the same period the previous year.

However, compared to other homegrown EV start-ups, like NIO and Li Auto, Xpeng's deliveries and gross margins are lagging behind.

NIO delivered 20,060 cars in the first quarter, with gross margin standing at 19.5 percent. Li Auto delivered 12,579 cars in the same period, slightly lower than Xpeng, but its gross margin was higher, standing at 17.3 percent, due to a higher product price.

The three companies, all listed in the U.S., are dubbed China's home-grown challengers to Tesla. But currently, Tesla still dominates in China in terms of market share and deliveries. Tesla delivered 184,800 cars in China in the same period.

But Xpeng's chairman and CEO says he is not sweating over profit margin. He says he is content with the current performance and believes that the long-term goal is more important.

""Some of our peer companies have really good gross margins, it's mainly because they target high-end customers, and their scale will run into a bottleneck in a few years,"" said He.

He also told CGTN the company's autopilot software earned over 80 million yuan ($12.38 million) last year, which is an exciting trend for the Xpeng. If the software has better gross margins, as the trend catches up the company will create new products and business systems.

The company launched the Navigation Guided Pilot (NGP) in January. The feature allows drivers to automatically change lanes and overtake cars as well as enter and exit highways. The NGP is a challenge to Tesla's autopilot feature and Nio's system NIO Pilot.

The global semiconductor shortage has been wreaking havoc on the global car industry since last year, cutting down the manufacturing capabilities of the automobile sector across the world. However, He believes in the long term, it's good for China as it will prompt the country to ramp up chip manufacturing.

He also clarified rumors that Xpeng is developing in-house chips. ""We are looking at many chip-related systems, but right now, we are still cooperating with our chip suppliers,"" he said.

China is currently the largest EV market and manufacturer in the world. Full-year EV sales could reach 2.4 million this year in China, according to a forecast by the China Passenger Car Association. Meanwhile, nearly half of the world¡¯s plug-in electric car production and 90 percent of heavy-duty electric vehicle production was in China in 2020, according to The International Council on Clean Transportation. Some industry insiders are concerned about whether an EV bubble is building. ""As long as there is demand, it's not a bubble,"" said He.

But He also warned the competition would become fierce in the next three to five years. The number of EV companies will be whittled down, with just a few left standing.

He Xiaopeng is the co-founder of Xpeng. He made his initial fortune by founding the browser UCWeb, which was sold to Alibaba in 2014. In the same year, the technocrat co-founded Xpeng's start-up team. A year later, the company was launched in southern China's Guangzhou.

Xpeng listed its shares on the New York Stock Exchange in August 2020. Seeking more capital to ramp up production and to hedge against the risks posed by the geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and China, Xpeng returned home and finished the dual primary listing on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in July and raised $1.8 billion in the IPO. Company executives also revealed the firm will consider listing on the A-share market on the Chinese mainland in the future.

The following excerpts from an interview with He have been edited for clarity and brevity.

CGTN: How has the global chip shortage affected Xpeng?

He: The chip shortage is influencing car manufacturers around the world, and Xpeng is no exception. We are doing a lot of work and communication every week to minimize the influence. I think the chip shortage will go on for months, but I think it won't have that obvious impact in the long term.

The chip shortage will cause a big blow to China's automobile industry. It means we need to have a backup in addition to the chips we have. It will also prompt China to establish its chip system. So in the long term, the recent chip shortage will benefit China's development.

CGTN: Does Xpeng have plans to develop chips in-house?

He: We are looking at many chip-related systems, but right now, we are still cooperating with all of our chip suppliers and reach a win-win.

CGTN: Xpeng achieved positive gross margins for the first time in 2020, but still lower than peer companies, why?

He: You can see that Xpeng's goal is to make mid-to-high-end cars. Our cars' prices are between 150,000 to 400,000 yuan. Our sales numbers allowed us to reach a gross margin of more than 10 percent with this price range; it's already pretty good.

We can see that most car-related companies in China have a gross margin of 10 to 20 percent. Still, their scale is a lot bigger than Xpeng, so we are confident that our scale will grow tremendously after the market improves, and our gross margin rate will also improve.

Some of our peer car companies have really good gross margins, it's mainly because they target high-end customers, but their scale will run into a bottleneck in a few years; we are observing it. So it doesn't matter who has a better gross margin first. What's important is the long-term goal.

We don't pursue the whole company's good profit. Still, we care about our products' gross margin, including both hardware and software gross margin.

Last season's financial report showed that our autopilot software earned over 80 million yuan for the first time. This product's gross margin is rather good. So I think this trend is just beginning. The software gradually has better gross margins. As the trend progresses, I think it will create brand new products and business systems.

CGTN: Is 2021 a crucial year for Xpeng to break even?

He: I don't think so. The most important things are long-term development as well as technological and product innovation.

Next is expanding the scale. Exactly how big of the scale will bring profit? Most of the time it's determined by the companies themselves. For example, if the R&D investment is low, then the company will profit early. But for us, if we want to compete globally, R&D is indispensable. This year we will more than double what we invested in R&D last year, and I think we will also invest a lot next year. The R&D investment is for 2025, when the fight turns from qualification to the knockout round. That's what we are focusing on.

CGTN: Recently, electric car companies such as Tesla were involved in many incidents, such as violating users' data privacy and alleged brake malfunction. How does that influence the electric car industry?

He: It will create some concerns for potential customers over electric cars. They will have some confusion. But I think as time goes by, the customers will soon regain their confidence.

CGTN: Some analysts think China's electric car industry is developing too fast, which might generate a big bubble. What's your take on that?

He: I think as long as there is demand in the market, it's not a bubble.

In the following five to 10 years, we will enter an active mobile internet era, which means that the mobile devices will move by themselves. Cars are among them.

It's a combination between hardware, software, internet operation and offline service scenarios. It's a massive market. But in the next three to five years, things might look like what happened to the first generation of Chinese smart car start-ups. The number of electric car companies goes from hundreds to just a few. I think it's a painful, yet also a happy process.

CGTN: Many internet giants are tossing their hats into the electric car industry. How will that influence Xpeng?

He: Competing with strong competitors around the world will make you stronger. Eventually, in the global market, there will only be several innovative car companies left. Like in this year's smartphone market, each player has a sizeable portion, and they take the major part of the market.

In terms of the supply chain and R&D system, with more talents joining the industry, they will become the foundation of the bigger talent pool in the future. To customers, this means that completely innovative smart electric cars will arrive sooner. I think it's the process of multi-party operation.

CGTN: Xpeng is a newcomer to the car industry. The brand's history and recognition are lacking. Will that present challenges to Xpeng's domestic and overseas development?

He: You see, there are many new consumer brands in China. Xpeng now has tied its brands with smartness. I think it's great.

Most Chinese carmakers are not putting their brands in the overseas market, especially to the consumer's market, the ultimate customer's market. To us, it's a zero to one process. During this process, it's who has the best technology and the best innovation has the biggest value. We are not worried. We are delighted to be able to compete in this completely new lane.

CGTN: Xpeng's sales numbers have been climbing since the end of last year. Will that drive up Xpeng's stock price?

He: I think to run a company is to look at the long-term development, and the stock market and secondary market fluctuations are short-term.

I basically don't look at the secondary market. As the founder of a company, I need to think about long-term development, do things well step by step. That's the most important thing. So we wouldn't make certain moves just for short-term gains.

How will China Unicom cope with heated competition in 5G application?,"Editor's note: The 2021 Boao Forum for Asia is held from April 18 to 21 in Boao, Hainan Province. Over 150 elite entrepreneurs from various business circles around the world will join government officials and scholars to discuss Asian economic cooperation and other issues. CGTN's Boss Talk series brings you special reports of industry representatives' views on technology, healthcare, manufacturing and recycling business outlook in a post-COVID-19 era.

China is undoubtedly leading the world in 5G development. More than 600,000 5G base stations were built and put into operation by the end of 2020, and the country is planning to build another 600,000 5G base stations this year, expanding coverage in more major cities. Among the top three 5G equipment providers, two of them are from China.

What does this mean? To ordinary users, it may just mean faster speed bands, but to industry insiders, the significant influence of 5G lies in its ability of reimagining and upgrading traditional industries, being able to process and make use of the huge amount of data we are generating every day, building a new pattern of development and eventually change our society.

But China's 5G efforts are not unhindered. The cost of 5G terminals and the electricity bill of running those terminals are much higher than that of 4G. On top of that, the sporadic bans issued against China's 5G manufacturers, such as Huawei and ZTE, by countries buying into the U.S.' conspiracy theory that China's 5G equipment could be used for espionage also chipped the country's share in the global 5G market.

Zhang Yunyong, general manager of the product department at China Unicom, one of China's big three telecom operators, told CGTN's Zhou Yiqiu that it's important for China's 5G development not to be discouraged by the turbulent global environment and the chip ban from the U.S. He believes that China's increased support for basic science education and research and development industries will eventually enable the industry to get through the tough time.

The following excerpts from the interview have been edited for clarity and brevity.

CGTN: What difficulties did you face and what experience have you gained in the construction of 5G infrastructure?

Zhang: We can see 5G as a high-speed road: it must be wider, more three-dimensional, more intelligent, more convenient and open to strengthening our real economy, sharing economy and digital economy. However, the construction of 5G is not that smooth. The cost is high, and the coverage of 5G is not as wide as 4G. The electricity charge is also very high.

Joint construction and sharing is our main experience. China Unicom and China Telecom have taken the lead in jointly building and sharing 5G, cutting nearly half of construction cost and saving about 100 billion yuan every year. It might save 500 billion yuan if we continue in the future. This is an important experience.

Secondly, we combined China Unicom's 100 MHz 5G frequency with China Telecom's 100 MHz frequency into 200 MHz frequency to lower the cost. In other words, the high-speed road is wider, which enabled us to go faster.

CGTN: How do you see the relationship between 5G and satellite internet and 6G proposed by the U.S.?

Zhang: Firstly, it's possible to embrace these new technologies in the future, such as some good features of 6G, and the addition of satellite internet for 5G construction. But it is too early to say that. At present, we need to concentrate on the construction and development of 5G.

There are four main 5G manufacturers in the world, China's Huawei and ZTE account for two of them. Moreover, Huawei and ZTE's patents account for one-third of the world's 5G industry.

So don't be disturbed by outside voices, they may even be voices from the U.S. looking to disrupt China's 5G.

CGTN: How can 5G go global for cooperation and exchanges?

Zhang: At present, there are two major situations. Firstly, the United States and the Five Eyes Alliance are trying to curb some Chinese enterprises like Huawei and ZTE.

Secondly, we have also developed a double-circulation pattern in which inner circulation predominates. Relying on the Belt and Road Initiative, we are building the Digital Silk Road. We are promoting 5G, high-speed railway and intelligent devices along the Belt and Road countries.

We will help China's 5G, high-speed railway and intelligent devices go abroad together to build a community with a shared future for mankind. For example, we are using these methods to shorten the digital gap between us and Africa, so they can enjoy the benefits of 5G.

I am also a member of the China-Africa Friendship Group of the CPPCC National Committee, and I have conducted standard cooperation and talent cooperation with them many times.

In addition to serving these countries, Chinese companies also have a strategy when going abroad. They will bring their communication services, 5G services, and 5G operation wherever they go.

Therefore, on the one hand, 5G enables high-quality development for these countries; on the other hand, 5G also expands production capacity and monetizes through digital autonomy.

CGTN: What do you think 5G will bring to human society£¿

Zhang: It's a good question. It is also a vision we had at the early stage of 5G development: 4G changed life, and 5G will change society.

Everyone in society can experience intelligence. For example, many people who can't drive can still use autonomous vehicles. Smart homes provide comfort in our everyday life. For instance, intelligent devices are installed in the doorbell and the kitchen, which makes people yearn for more. Medical care for the elderly and education for kids used to be a problem, it may be relieved now.

Governance is more important. Smart cities and digital governments built by 5G will enable more data operations and help the public to avoid detours. Also, 5G is applied to environment monitoring and air pollution prevention. 5G and the digital economy have increased government efficiency.

And the key is data, which is the most important factor for the flow of the digital economy and a 5G-enabled society. The future will be a data society."

Zimbabwe hopeful of hitting maize collection target,"Efforts by authorities in Zimbabwe to improve the country's food security are bearing fruit with the nation reporting a significant increase in deliveries of maize, a staple food crop in the country.

The Grain Marketing Board reported that more than 900,000 tonnes of maize had been delivered between April and September compared to just 138,000 tonnes during a similar period last year.

The board remains ""well on course"" to hit its target of 1.8 million tonnes given they are still receiving grain from farmers, according to the chief executive Rockie Mutenha. Zimbabwe's national production is currently estimated at around 2.8 million tonnes.

""The ongoing grain intake season is proceeding well compared to the same period last year,¡± Mutenha said.

Zimbabwe suffered a devastating drought last year which saw it produce 900,000 tonnes with 170,000 tonnes being delivered to the country's national granary.

Even though Zimbabwe may fail to achieve its target, some experts are not overly concerned about a possible food shortage situation as they believe several households have enough food stocks to carry them through to the next harvesting period.

Despite a slight drop in weekly deliveries, which are at about 50 percent, analysts argue that deliveries may be boosted by a good harvest season.

Another indicator of the improvement in grain supply is the fact that maize prices, which tend to surge during this period, according to local media, have remained largely stable.

Zimbabwe's agricultural sector has rebounded impressively after the challenges of last year's severe drought.

In July, senior officials in the cotton industry said they expected to exceed an initial projection of 150,000 tonnes of cotton produced this season making it the highest such yield in five years.

Last month, Finance Minister Mthuli Ncube said poultry production this year was expected to rebound from a decline in 2020 due to a successful crop season.

Expert: Shenzhen's Qianhai offers opportunities for HK,"China unveiled a plan earlier this month to further develop the Qianhai Shenzhen-Hong Kong Modern Service Industry Cooperation Zone.

The economic zone will reduce the barriers and transaction costs for individuals and financial institutions in Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland, said Bao Zhengyang, assistant professor from the school of finance at Xiamen University's department of economics.

The plan is set to promote the use of RMB for cross-border settlements and improve foreign exchange management and deepen cooperation in green finance among Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao through unified green finance standards. New mechanisms will also be set up for cross-border financial trading and international payments, according to the plan.

As the economic zone is set to provide better financial infrastructures, such as better payment methods like digital RMB and faster telecommunication technologies to attract financial innovations in the area, Bao said these will attract banks and financial companies from Hong Kong to set up offices in the zone.

Bao said that the financial sector in Hong Kong will benefit from economy of scale and positive spillover effect due to the expansion of the economic zone, as the Qianhai zone is expected to attract more investments and talents globally thanks to the strong policy support.

Bao is also expecting Qianhai economic zone to drive the integration of the Greater Bay Area, as the diversity in the economic zone calls for unification. The economic zone will also provide a platform for communications and collaborations, which in return facilitates unification.

However, he points out there are challenges to formulating a unified system, since Hong Kong and Macao use different currencies, have distinct financial laws and apply different exchange rate regimes.

Some suspect that the plan will bring negative effects to Hong Kong's status as a leading international financial center, but Bao said that the policy will strengthen Hong Kong¡¯s leading role as a global financial center, as the expansion of the Qianhai zone lowers the barrier for investment and capital flows between China and the globe through different connect programs.

The policy will attract more foreign capital due to the favorable conditions, enhancing Hong Kong¡¯s role as a center for capital exchange, said Bao. He added the Qianhai economic zone is an ideal incubator for financial innovations and FinTech developments, strengthening Hong Kong¡¯s position as one of the most innovative financial centers."
Yellen: Debt default would 'permanently' weaken America,"U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen issued a fresh plea for Congress to raise the federal debt ceiling on Sunday, arguing a default on U.S. debt would trigger a historic financial crisis.

In a Wall Street Journal opinion piece, Yellen said the crisis triggered by a default would compound the damage from the continuing coronavirus pandemic, roiling markets and plunging the U.S. economy back into recession at the cost of millions of jobs and a lasting hike in interest rates.

""We would emerge from this crisis a permanently weaker nation,"" Yellen said, noting that the U.S.'s creditworthiness has been a strategic advantage.

Yellen did not offer a new timeline for a possible default, but described economic damage that would fall on consumers through higher borrowing costs and lower asset prices.

She has said previously that a default could come during October when the Treasury exhausts its cash reserves and extraordinary borrowing capacity under the $28.4 trillion debt limit.

""We can borrow more cheaply than almost any other country, and defaulting would jeopardize this enviable fiscal position. It would also make America a more expensive place to live, as the higher cost of borrowing would fall on consumers,"" Yellen wrote.

Republicans have refused to support raising or suspending the debt limit. U.S. Senator Bill Cassidy from Louisiana said earlier on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" program that Democrats want to increase the borrowing cap to fund trillions of dollars in ""Democratic wish list"" spending.

Yellen argued the debt ceiling is about paying for past spending obligations, and said waiting too long to lift the debt ceiling can still cause damage, citing a 2011 debt ceiling crisis that pushed the federal government to the brink of default that prompted a credit rating downgrade.

""This led to financial-market disruptions that persisted for months. Time is money here, potentially billions of dollars. Neither delay nor default is tolerable,"" she added."
Cash-strapped Evergrande starts repaying investors with property,"Leading Chinese property developer Evergrande Group has begun repaying investors in its wealth management products with real estate, its financial unit Evergrande Wealth said in an online statement on Saturday.

The second-largest property giant in China, which had also been expanding its businesses to new energy cars and healthcare, has recently been hit by a liquidity crisis, with its liabilities mounting to over 1.97 trillion yuan ($304 billion), according to its half-year financial report released in late August.

The group has been struggling to raise funds to repay its many lenders and suppliers. It revealed in an exchange filing on Tuesday that it faces higher pressure on liquidity for the expected continuous fall in September, warning broader default risk.

China Evergrande expects plunging property sales in September to affect liquidity

The situation was exacerbated as investors gathered at Evergrande's headquarters in south China's Shenzhen demanding redemption of the company's wealth management products earlier this week.

In the Saturday statement, Evergrande Wealth said that their repayment work with property has begun and investors interested in redeeming wealth management products for physical assets should contact their investment consultants or visit the listed local offices across 27 provincial-level regions in China.

In a separate statement on Saturday, Evergrande said that six of its executives had redeemed 12 investment products in advance between May 1 and September 7 this year.

Evergrande said that it has requested these executives to return all the funds redeemed within a certain time frame, adding it will impose severe penalties on them.

The contract sales of properties of Evergrande amounted to 71.63 billion yuan in June, 43.78 billion yuan in July, and 38.08 billion yuan in August this year, showing a decreasing trend, according to the Tuesday filing.

Evergrande has also encountered repeated downgrades by international rating agencies in recent months, such as S&P Global Ratings and Fitch Ratings ¨C both warning of the risk of default.

Evergrande's main unit, Evergrande Real Estate Group, applied on Thursday to suspend trading of its onshore corporate bonds following a downgrade from China's largest rating agency China Chengxin International (CCXI).

Its bonds were downgraded to A from AA, the second downgrade from CCXI in September.

More Chinese consumers have rushed to order the latest iPhone in 2021 than they did last year, according to South China Morning Post.

More than two million preorders for the new iPhone 13 had been placed on Apple's official store on Chinese retailer JD.com as of Thursday, according to a South China Morning Post report, surpassing the 1.5 million iPhone 12 pre-orders on the same platform in 2020.

Consumers are surprised the new iPhone 13 models were cheaper by about 300 to 800 yuan (about $45 to $125) than the corresponding iPhone 12 models. On Friday, when Apple's official preorders started, many Chinese consumers complained on social media platform Weibo that the Apple Chinese website was difficult to access, likely due to the surge in demand.

However, the booming orders didn't actively show on Apple's stock price, which closed down 1.83 percent on Friday. Its market value lost $45 billion from the previous trading day.

The ""winner-takes-all"" attribute of large financial technology companies may trigger a market monopoly and reduce innovation efficiency, said the top official of the People's Bank of China (PBOC).

The fast development of financial technology in China has helped its e-commerce, poverty alleviation and anti-pandemic measures, but it has also revealed problems such as payment institutions ""penetrating"" the financial sector, PBOC Governor Yi Gang said in a meeting on Tuesday.

Yi noted that all financial activities should be supervised and financial businesses must be operated with licenses.

Chinese city launches new freight train route to Poland,"A new China-Europe freight train route linking southwest China's Chengdu, capital of Sichuan Province, with the Polish port city of Gdansk, was launched Friday.

The first cargo train carrying goods such as furniture, household appliances, and machinery and equipment departed from Chengdu on Friday to Gdansk, the largest city and most important seaport in Poland's northern coastal region.

The successful launch of this route marks another extension of China-Europe freight train service from Chengdu into the hinterland of Europe. It is expected to help strengthen the economic, trade and cultural exchanges between China and Poland and other countries along the route, according to Chengdu International Railway Port Administrative Committee.

Chengdu has added eight new overseas stations to its China-Europe freight train routes so far this year. Its China-Europe freight trains can reach a total of 66 destinations in Europe.

China-Mongolia border port sees robust growth in freight transport,"The import and export values of goods transported via the border port of Erenhot in north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region posted a yearly increase of 38.2 percent to reach 22.04 billion yuan (about 3.42 billion U.S. dollars) in the first eight months of this year, local customs said Friday.

The import volume registered 15.34 billion yuan during the period, increasing by 41.9 percent year on year, while that of the exports totaled 6.7 billion yuan, up 30.4 percent year on year, said the customs of Erenhot.

The rapid import growth shows China's steady economic recovery since the beginning of this year. Meanwhile, the rising trend of the global market price for bulk commodities is another factor driving the growth.

In terms of exports, the COVID-19 pandemic wreaked havoc on Mongolia's domestic production capacity, making it more dependent on imports from China. In the first eight months of this year, China's exports of mechanical and electrical products to Mongolia increased by 57.5 percent as a result of Mongolia's increasing demand for mine equipment.

Erenhot Port, the only railway port between China and Mongolia and a substantial channel for international cargo, has around 50 China-Europe freight train routes passing through it.

"Pet insurance demand rises, but growth not as fast as expected","Nine-year-old Baobao is not an expensive breed, but that hasn't stopped his owner from giving him all the love and attention.

Last year, Baobao's owner bought him a pet insurance ¨C a little more than 800 yuan (about $124 dollars) a year ¨C to cover common diseases and accidental injuries.

""Baobao caught Canine distemper when he was young and that cost me over 10,000 yuan (about $1,550 dollars). So, buying a pet insurance can help alleviate the financial pressure,"" said Baobao's owner Yan Ge.

Pet insurance compensates between 20 and 40 percent on average, of the medical payment. In fact, this type of insurance is not a new thing ¨C it was first introduced in China in 2004.

The pet insurance industry has been growing in the Chinese market for nearly a decade. Though the demand exists, it is still relatively small.

In Zehang Pet Hospital in downtown Hangzhou, pets that have their own insurance only account for a minor proportion of the total number of pets that get treatment.

""Some 10 to 15 percent of the pets have insurance. Their owners are mostly young women,"" said Chen Hao, Head of Zehang Pet Hospital.

In Sweden, pet insurance coverage rate is deemed at 40 percent, the highest worldwide. However, the rate in China is only one percent. Chinese families are keeping more pets, but most of them know little about where and how to get such contracts.

Insurance companies are trying different methods to attract more customers. Last year, ZhongAn Online Insurance introduced a new technology to make it easier for people to buy insurance plans. Pet owners only need to upload their pets' pictures and the company will then set an ID for the pets by analyzing their nose print.

""Customers need to upload three photos ¨C the pet's front face, full body and a picture of the owner with the animal. The accuracy rate of nose print detection is above 99 percent,"" said Li Shuang, product manager of ZhongAn Online Insurance.

Whether this strategy could further boost the demand remains a question. ZhongAn insurance's fiscal report shows that the premium of pet insurance grew by 60 times (annually) in the first half of 2021, serving more than one million pet owners. This figure is however still not ideal for China where 100 million pets currently live.

Making pet insurance popular in China may still take a long time."

China's fiscal revenue logged a year-on-year increase of 18.4 percent in the first eight months of the year, official data showed Friday.

Fiscal revenue amounted to about 15.01 trillion yuan (about $2.33 trillion) during the period, according to the Ministry of Finance.

Tax revenue came in at 12.96 trillion yuan in the January-August period, up 19.8 percent year on year.

Revenue from value-added tax, the largest source of fiscal revenue in the country, rose 19.1 percent year on year to 4.54 trillion yuan, while that from individual income tax jumped 23 percent from a year ago to 939.7 billion yuan.

In the first eight months, the central government and local governments collected nearly 7.05 trillion yuan and 7.96 trillion yuan in fiscal revenue, respectively, rising 18.9 percent and 17.9 percent year on year.

Friday's data also showed that China's fiscal spending went up 3.6 percent year on year to 15.54 trillion yuan for the first eight months.

Fiscal expenditure on education saw a yearly increase of 7.9 percent during the period, while spending on health and medical care rose 3.9 percent, the ministry said."

Carbon neutrality brings new opportunities for green finance,"Carbon-pricing mechanism is one of the new models China embraced as it pledged to reach peak emissions before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060, which ""will bring enormous opportunities in investment and earthshaking changes in financial business models,"" said Xiao Gang, former head of the China Securities Regulatory Commission.

It's been two months since China's first-ever carbon market began trading in July, replacing the EU's as the world's largest. As of September 16, the market's cumulative trading volume of the CarbonEmissions Allowance (CEA) was 8.4 million tonnes, with a cumulative turnover of 417 million yuan ($64 million).

So far, the market covers over 2,000 companies, mostly state-owned power and heat giants, which operate coal and gas plants. The market gives financial incentives to reduce their emissions. Basically, companies are allowed to purchase or sell carbon credits in the market, which are quotas or allowances for emissions generated during production.

With traditional industries trying desperately to reduce CO2 emissions in line with China's green drive, experts said new openings will inevitably appear in multiple sectors, for instance, wind and solar power, high quality manufacturing and innovative applications using carbon as a green material, which can inspire China to achieve its climate goals.

Although market-oriented trading, using carbon as a commodity, has the potential to efficiently reduce emissions whilst still achieving high-quality growth, some argued the responsibility of cutting carbon emissions should not fall solely on corporations.

""One resident produces about 10 tonnes of carbon emissions every year. So, we could set a bar and charge taxes if the emissions exceed this number, or give stipends when they are lower,"" said Ju Jiandong, director of the research center for green finance development at the PBC School of Finance, a joint venture between Tsinghua University and the People's Bank of China.

Ju said China's carbon market is still in a phase with room to grow in sectors including legislation and pricing. He pointed out that the EU's program has a turnover ratio ¨C a key indicator of a stock's liquidity ¨C 80 times that of China's number and with a price roughly 10 times of China's CEA prices.

""If the market should fall short of expectation to efficiently boost development to reach carbon neutrality, we may as well count on the tax measures,"" said the director."" The tax is already active in Europe and Canada, some other Asian countries including Singapore and Japan. India is expected to levy the tax in 2022. But so far, China hasn't implemented this tax.""

China has made tremendous efforts on its green shift of economic and social development. In 2019, China's carbon emission intensity dropped by 48 percent compared with 2015, according to a report last year by the State Information Office.

Experts said it will not be easy to find the best way forward but hopefully the country may ultimately reshape the nature of key industries, economies and lifestyles for a greener future."
Light vehicle production to drop 6.2% in 2021 on chip delays: IHS,"Semiconductor shortages and the delayed packaging and testing of the chips will cause production of global light vehicles to drop by 6.2 percent, or five million this year, London-based market research firm IHS Markit estimated on Thursday.

The pandemic-induced chip shortage has repeatedly halted auto plant operations and prompted them to scale back delivery targets since the end of 2020.

IHS Markit also downgraded the production forecast of global light vehicles by 9.3 percent to 82.6 million units in 2022, citing supply chain challenges.

Packaging and testing operations within the semiconductor sector in Malaysia were impacted due to the government's lockdown measures in early June, IHS said, compounding difficulties in an already constrained supply chain.

""Our interpretation of the situation in Malaysia, which is responsible for 13 percent of the global supply of semiconductors for the automotive industry, has become more pessimistic,"" IHS said.

Toyota, the world's largest automaker, recently announced that it would cut global auto production by 40 percent in September amid a chip crunch worsened by a COVID-19 resurgence in key Asian semiconductor production hubs.

Explainer: What caused the chip shortage?

IHS said the semiconductor snafus have resulted in lost production of 3.1 million units in the third quarter, nearly double its previous forecast.

""The outlook for Q4 now reflects heightened risk as challenges to the supply chain ¨C primarily semiconductors ¨C remain entrenched.""

China's master plan to support Macao-Guangdong integration,"Han, also a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and head of the leading group for developing the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, said Friday's inauguration is a historic moment for the cooperation zone, and its construction thus enters a new phase of full implementation and acceleration.

To enrich the practice of ""One Country, Two Systems"" and offer a driving force for Macao's long-term development, China announced on September 5 a general plan for building a Guangdong-Macao in-depth cooperation zone in Hengqin.

The Administrative Organizations of the Guangdong-Macao In-depth Cooperation Zone in Hengqin, an island in Zhuhai, was officially unveiled on Friday, a further step towards carrying out China's master plan to diversify Macao's development through closer integration with the mainland.

The vice premier called for efforts to grow new industries to promote a moderately diversified economy in Macao and inject new impetus in the long-term development of Macao.

Han stressed the need to prioritize people's livelihoods and provide more convenient conditions for Macao residents who study, work, start businesses, and live in the cooperation zone.

He also stressed openness and inclusiveness and the need to actively explore the alignment of rules and systems of Guangdong and Macao.

He urged Guangdong and Macao to strengthen cooperation and steadily improve the new mechanism of extensive consultation, joint contribution, joint management, and shared benefits.

New industries in new space

Hengqin, which is located in the southern part of Zhuhai City in Guangdong Province, is the city's largest island and just five minutes by shuttle bus from Macao.

Hengqin free trade zone was set up in 2015 and the island later became a key hub for the Greater Bay Area.

By the end of 2020, the once-remote island had become a modern city with a total GDP of 46.8 billion yuan, according to official data.

The plan defines the cooperation zone, which covers a total area of 106 square kilometers, three times the size of Macao, as a new platform to boost the special administrative region's economic diversification, and a new space to facilitate Macao residents' life and employment.

Macao's small space limited the development of many industries, therefore Macao asked the central government for additional land in Hengqin and received permission, Chief Executive of Macao Ho Iat Seng said in an interview with China Media Group broadcast on September 12.

As the world's gambling hub, Macao's single economic structure made it vulnerable to turbulences such as the pandemic. Official data showed that its GDP shrank by 56.23 percent year on year in 2020 when tourist numbers dropped 80 percent compared to 2019.

The over-dependence on gambling and tourism also discourages young people from joining promising industries such as technology.

The cooperation zone plan is designed to solve these problems by promoting four major industries, including tech and high-end manufacturing; traditional Chinese medicine and other signature businesses of Macao; industries related to culture, tourism, conventions, exhibitions, business and trade and also modern finance, especially with Portuguese-speaking countries.

To encourage talents and businesses to join the cooperation zone, generous tax cuts and other preferential policies are offered.

The enterprise income tax rate will be 15 percent for companies in Hengqin, compared with the normal 20-25 percent on the Chinese mainland. Personal income tax for Macao residents working in Hengqin will be the same as the rate in Macao, which is lower than the rate on the Chinese mainland.

New management structure

As an integration platform, the Hengqin zone adopts a co-management system.

Ma Xingrui, the governor of Guangdong, and Macao's chief executive Ho have been appointed as the co-leaders of the Hengqin zone administration committee, which will make major decisions on plans, policies and personnel appointments.

Under the administration committee, there is an executive committee responsible for business promotion, land development and project operation. The executive committee will be led by officials appointed by the Macao SAR government and participated in by officials from Guangdong and Zhuhai.

The management mechanism showed that the Hengqin zone will fully consider Macao's needs and requests, according to a research note from China Merchants Securities.

Bad weather in Brazil means more expensive coffee in Shanghai,"As extreme weather this year has damaged coffee bean crops in the world's largest coffee bean producer Brazil, coffee beans supplies are tightening up, which has put the price of coffee beans up to a six-year high and added costs to coffee shop owners in China, one of the world's largest consumption markets for coffee.

Coffee bean prices have been going up since last November when Brazil had a drought, said Shang Wentao, general manager of S.Ishimitsu & Co. (Shanghai).

""And then in July, the country had severe frosts, which further stoked the price increase. The futures price for Arabica coffee beans has been surging from $1.6 a pound since July 21, once hitting $2.15 a pound. The business is going to be hit by Brazil's production situation, as it accounts for a third of all the beans. Analysts have lowered estimates for Brazil coffee bean production by 20 percent,"" said Shang.

""The most important events were severe frosts in Brazil in July, and that impact will last for two or three years,"" said Jose Sette, executive director of International Coffee Organization, as he explained the reasons for the sharp increase in coffee bean prices.

Besides extreme weather, labor shortages and COVID-19 related logistics problems aggravate the production bottleneck of Brazil's coffee beans.

""The price to move a container from Vietnam, which is the world second largest coffee producer, kept rising. Before the pandemic, the price to move from Vietnam to developed countries like Europe or North America used to be $800, now it is $8,000. We can also see this similar situation in Brazil,"" said Sette.

Sette, also said coffee retailers will eventually pass on price increases to consumers, but by how much depends on the price elasticity of demand between markets.

The surge in prices is likely to affect coffee enthusiasts beginning next year, Shang said."

China's National Development and Reform Commission issues a plan to improve the country's ""dual control system"" on energy consumption and energy intensity, September 11, 2021. /CFP

China will firmly control energy-hungry and high-emission projects, the National Development and Reform Commission said in a recently issued plan, according to a notice released on Thursday.

The plan aims to improve China's ""dual control system"" on energy consumption and energy intensity, or the amount of energy consumed per unit of GDP.

The dual control system, first set in the country's 11th Five-Year Plan (2006-2010), has taken on added significance since Chinese President Xi Jinping in September 2020 committed the country to peaking carbon emissions by 2030 and becoming carbon neutral by 2060.

According to the plan, China will set a five-year target of energy consumption and energy intensity for different provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities, in an effort to reasonably manage indicators of total energy consumption and energy intensity.

The plan also clarified a series of phased goals of China.

By 2025, the dual control system will be more complete, with a more reasonable allocation of energy resources and sharply improved energy utilization efficiency.

By 2030, with a further improved dual control system, the intensity of energy consumption will continue to drop significantly, the total energy consumption be reasonably controlled and the energy structure be more optimized.

By 2035, the optimal allocation of energy and the comprehensive conservation system of resources will be more mature and finalized, which will strongly support the achievement of the goal of steadily reducing carbon emissions after reaching the peak."
China extends tariff exemption for U.S. goods,"China announced the fifth tariff exemption list for certain U.S. products on Thursday.

In a notice, the Customs Tariff Commission of the State Council said that tariff exemption for 81 U.S. items will start on Friday and run through April 16, 2022.

The tariffs imposed by China were set to counter the U.S. 301 measures, which led to trade frictions between the world's two largest economies.

China's Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) on Thursday said that it will earnestly implement the important consensus reached by top leaders of China and the U.S. earlier over the phone.

As China's new energy vehicle sector enters a new development stage, the country will accelerate R&D and industrialization of key technologies, such as automotive chips and operating systems, while coping with challenges and embracing opportunities, Chinese Vice Premier Han Zheng said on Thursday.

China is the largest producer and consumer of cars and has ranked first worldwide for the six consecutive years in production and sales volume, Han said while addressing the 2021 World New Energy Vehicle Congress (WNEVC) via a video link.

The three-day WNEVC, themed ""Comprehensively promoting marketization, accelerating cross-industry integration, jointly achieving carbon neutrality,"" kicked off on September 15 in Haikou, capital of south China's Hainan Province.

In recent years, China has made efforts to develop the NEVs industry to meet the country's goals of a carbon peak by 2030 and achieving carbon neutrality nationwide by 2060.

China has formed an effective industrial chain of the NEVs industry, with leading technology of key components and parts, Han said.

Besides technological innovation, Han also stressed adhering to the market-driven strategy while China improves the industrial management and supportive policies.

China will speed up infrastructure construction, promote public and private consumption of NEVs, and continue to expand the scale of NEVs application, he added."
China Evergrande onshore bond trading suspended after downgrade,"China Evergrande Group's main unit, Hengda Real Estate Group, applied on Thursday to suspend trading of its onshore corporate bonds following a downgrade, as the country's second-largest property developer wrestles with a liquidity crisis.

The application follows repeated trading freezes of the bonds in recent days by the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges as a result of volatile trading.

Hengda said it had applied to suspend trade of its onshore corporate bonds for one day. On the resumption of trade on Friday, its Shanghai and Shenzhen exchange-traded bonds will only be traded through negotiated transactions.

The company's January 2023 Shenzhen-traded bond was last quoted at 24.99 yuan ($3.88) on Wednesday, and its Shanghai-traded May 2023 bond traded at 30 yuan.

Hengda received notice on Wednesday from the country's largest rating agency China Chengxin International (CCXI) that the bonds' ratings had been downgraded to A from AA, and that both the bonds' ratings and its issuer rating were put on a watch list for further downgrades.

CCXI's downgrade of the developer was its second this month. A downgrade of Evergrande and its onshore bonds to AA from AAA on September 2 resulted in the bonds being made ineligible for pledged repo trading.

S&P Global Ratings this week further downgraded Evergrande to ""CC"" from ""CCC.""

Evergrande is scrambling to raise funds for its total liabilities of more than $300 billion.

The People's Bank of China and the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission issued a joint statement in August, saying that they had summoned the developer's executives and urged them to reduce the group's debt risks and prioritize stability.

The regulatory talks came amid concerns that any financial crisis at Evergrande could pose a potential systemic risk to the economy.

UNCTAD: Global economy will bounce back with 5.3% growth in 2021,"The global economy will bounce back with growth of 5.3 percent this year, the fastest rate in nearly 50 years, according to the Trade and Development Report 2021 released by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) on Thursday.

The rebound is thanks to the continuation of radical policy interventions began in 2020 and a successful vaccine rollout in advanced economies, the report said.

However, the recovery is highly uneven across geographical, income and sectoral lines.

In developed economies, the rentier class has seen an explosion in wealth, while low-earners struggle. For developing economies, due to lack of monetary autonomy and access to vaccines, their economies are held back, and their gulf with developed economies is widened.

""These widening gaps, both domestic and international, are a reminder that underlying conditions, if left in place, will make resilience and growth luxuries enjoyed by fewer and fewer privileged people,"" said Rebeca Grynspan, the secretary-general of UNCTAD.

Global growth is expected to slow to 3.6 percent in 2022, leaving world income 3.7 percent below where its pre-pandemic trend would have put it. Cumulative income loss is expected to be $13 trillion in 2020-2022.

Many countries in the South, most notably in Africa and South Asia, have been hit much harder than during the global financial crisis, while their now heavier debt burden reduces their room for fiscal policy.

International trade has recovered after the overall flow dropped 5.6 percent last year. It is projected that real growth of global trade will be 9.5 percent in 2021.

But global output will only resume its trend in 2016-2019 by 2030 even barring significant setbacks."

Speaking on the latest trade development between China and the U.S., Shu Jueting, the ministry's spokesperson, told a media conference that trade teams from both countries have maintained communications.

U.S. regulators wary of Big Tech swallowing startups,"The logos of (clockwise from top left) Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon. /CFP

The logos of (clockwise from top left) Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon. /CFP

U.S. antitrust regulators signaled Wednesday greater scrutiny of Big Tech giants' smaller acquisitions, a potential new avenue in efforts to curb the dominance of the companies.

Google's parent Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft carried out hundreds of deals in recent years that were too small to be reported to authorities for approval, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) heard at its meeting.

Commissioner Rebecca Slaughter said regulators need this type of broader perspective, and that reviewing acquisitions individually was insufficient.

""I think of serial acquisitions as a Pac-Man strategy: each individual merger, viewed independently, may not seem to have a significant impact,"" her prepared comments said.

""The collective impact of hundreds of smaller acquisitions can lead to a monopolistic behemoth.""

She spoke as the commission heard findings from a study launched in February last year into over 600 acquisitions by the tech titans from 2010 to 2019, some of which were below the threshold for reporting.

Appointments to the FTC and the Department of Justice in U.S. President Joe Biden's administration have signaled ramped up antitrust enforcement, amid calls by some to break up some of the biggest and most successful Big Tech firms.

FTC has filed suit against Facebook, alleging it used ""anti-competitive acquisitions"" of potential rivals such as Instagram and WhatsApp to protect its dominance.

Additionally, the Justice Department's antitrust division said it is working with the commission to carefully review its guidelines on ""harmful mergers"" such as big firms gobbling up small operators in markets.

""The Department of Justice is conducting a careful review of the Horizontal Merger Guidelines and the Vertical Merger Guidelines to ensure they are appropriately skeptical of harmful mergers,"" acting attorney general Richard Powers said in a release.

FTC chair Lina Khan noted Big Tech companies have devoted ""tremendous resources"" on acquisitions that are ""largely outside of our purview.""

""This study underscores the need for us to closely examine reporting requirements... and to identify areas where the FTC may have created loopholes that are unjustifiably enabling deals to fly under the radar.""

Facebook in July filed a formal request calling for the recusal of Khan in any antitrust action against the social media giant, arguing that she is biased and cannot rule impartially.

The move follows a similar request from Amazon in anticipation of a wave of antitrust enforcement action against Big Tech firms from the regulatory agency under its leader appointed by Biden."

Meituan and Ele.me delivery drivers at a crossroad in east China's Shandong Province, May 25, 2021. /CFP

Food delivery giants Meituan and Alibaba Group's Ele.me both emphasized this week they will not force delivery drivers to register as independent businesses, a bone of contention amid China's ongoing scrutiny of the sector.

Many drivers for food delivery or ride-hailing apps are hired indirectly by the platform and do not receive basic social or medical insurance.

A social media account covering labor law published an article this week alleging some drivers working for Meituan and Ele.me were operating as individual businesses, as opposed to employees of the platform or a third-party company, thereby reducing the platform company's legal obligations to the driver. The piece spread widely across China's internet.

In a social media post published late on Tuesday, Meituan wrote that it aimed to improve its treatment of riders in aspects such as income, social security, and health and safety.

Ele.me published a statement on Wednesday pledging not to force drivers to register as independent businesses.

The promise comes as part of a broader push from regulators to improve conditions for ""gig-economy"" workers.

Chinese regulators gathered 10 leading delivery and ride-hailing companies for a meeting last week to give guidance on better-protecting labor rights. The meeting focused on improving how platform firms distributed incomes and ensured rest periods for workers.

Regulators drafted guidelines in July urging food delivery platforms to guarantee their workers' income was above the local minimum wage.

The July guideline also said that platforms and third-party contractors should participate in social insurance programs for the delivery drivers they employ.

China statistical bureau: Still observing Evergrande's default risk,"Some real estate giants have encountered difficulties in their operations, and the impact on the industry still needs to be observed, an official from China's statistical bureau said on Wednesday responding to a question on Evergrande's default risk.

Various departments across China have adhered to the principle of ""housing is to live, not for speculation"" since the beginning of 2021, and continued to stabilize housing and land prices, said Fu Linghui, spokesperson of the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), addressing a press conference.

He added that the operation of the overall real estate market has been stable.

Evergrande is the second-largest property developer in China, according to an industry ranking. The default fears led its stock to plunge almost 12 percent on Monday and a further five percent decline on Wednesday.

The company said in a Tuesday filing that two of its subsidiaries had failed to uphold guarantee obligations for 934 million yuan ($145 million) worth of wealth management products issued by third parties.

That could ""lead to cross-default"" which ""would have a material adverse effect on the group's business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations,"" it said in a statement to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange."
China to launch Southbound Bond Connect on Sept. 24,"China will officially launch its long-awaited Southbound Bond Connect on September 24, the latest step to deepen financial cooperation between the mainland and Hong Kong, regulators said on Wednesday.

The connection will enable Chinese mainland institutional investors to invest in the Hong Kong bond market, according to a joint statement by the People's Bank of China and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.

The new arrangement comes four years after the Northbound Bond Connect, which allows overseas investors to trade bonds on the Chinese mainland, was established in July 2017.

The completion of the two-way connection of the bond markets will promote further mutual access between the two financial markets and reinforce Hong Kong's status as an international financial center, said Carrie Lam, the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.

According to Lam, the Northbound Bond Connect with foreign holding of mainland onshore bonds increased from about 880 billion yuan ($136.8 billion) in 2017 to 3.8 trillion yuan as of August this year.

Currently, domestic institutional investors are allowed to invest in offshore securities and bonds within quotas under the Qualified Domestic Institutional Investor (QDII), which was launched in 2006.

The bond connection is also seen as an effort to further interlink the country's Greater Bay Area (GBA), including southern China's Guangdong Province, Hong Kong and Macao Special Administrative Regions.

Last Friday, China kicked off its cross-border wealth management connect (WMC) program, under which individual residents in the GBA carry out cross-boundary investment in wealth management products distributed by banks in the GBA."

Huawei may not overcome the difficulties caused by U.S. suppression and blockages without years of efforts in science and research and deep cooperation with global scientists, Ren said.

The U.S. has placed the company on a trade blacklist to limit its uses of American technologies.

Ren insisted that there has been no chaos within the company as a result of the ban. Instead, the company is now more united than ever and has even attracted more talent despite the U.S. suppression, Ren said."
U.S. inflation coming off the boil as prices increase slowly in August,"Underlying U.S. consumer prices increased at their slowest pace in six months in August as used motor vehicle prices tumbled, suggesting that inflation had probably peaked, though it could remain high for a while amid persistent supply constraints.

The broad slowdown in price pressures reported by the Labor Department on Tuesday aligns with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's long-held belief that high inflation is transitory. Still, economists cautioned it was too early to celebrate and expected the U.S. central bank to lay out plans in November to start scaling back its massive monthly bond-buying program.

The consumer price index (CPI), excluding the volatile food and energy components, edged up 0.1 percent last month. That was the smallest gain since February and followed a 0.3-percent rise in July.

""Inflation remains troublingly strong, even if it is not exploding like it did earlier in the year,"" said James McCann, deputy chief economist at Aberdeen Standard Investments in Boston. ""If we continue to see further step-downs in inflation over the next six months, that should ease the pressure on the Fed to quickly follow tapering with interest rate rises.""

The so-called core CPI was held back by a 1.5-percent decline in prices for used cars and trucks, which ended five straight monthly increases. Robust rises in prices of used cars and trucks as well as services in industries worst affected by the COVID-19 pandemic were the key drivers behind a heating up of inflation at the start of the year.

Airline fares plunged by 9.1 percent in August, likely as a resurgence in infections, driven by the Delta variant of the coronavirus, sapped demand for air travel. There were also decreases in motor vehicle rentals and insurance.

In the 12 months through August, the core CPI increased by 4 percent after advancing 4.3 percent in the 12 months through July. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the core CPI would gain 0.3 percent for the month and increase by 4.2 percent year on year.

Stocks on Wall Street were trading lower. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose.

Supply constraints remain

In addition to the price surge for used cars and trucks appearing to have run its course, hotel and motel accommodation prices are now above the pre-pandemic level, suggesting moderate gains ahead.

Prices for hotels and motels accommodation fell by 3.3 percent after shooting up 6.8 percent in July. Some of the price plunge was probably because of the soaring coronavirus infections.

But bottlenecks in the supply chain remain and the labor market is tightening, pushing up wages. There were a record 10.9 million job openings as of the end of July, forcing companies to boost wages as they compete for workers."
"China's retail sales rises 2.5% in August, far below expectation","Wangfujing, a pedestrian street and one of the main shopping centers in Beijing, China. /CFP Wangfujing, a pedestrian street and one of the main shopping centers in Beijing, China. /CFP

China's retail sales of consumer goods rose 2.5 percent in August from a year earlier, far below market expectations, while value-added industrial output went up 5.3 percent year on year, both slowing from July due to new COVID-19 outbreaks, official data (link in Chinese) showed Wednesday. Retail sales registered the slowest growth since August 2020, a sharp drop from the 8.5 percent in July, according to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), putting the average two-year growth at 1.5 percent. The figure in August was far below the projection of a 7-percent rise by both Reuters and Bloomberg.

Notably, the catering industry saw revenue fall 4.5 percent in August compared with a year ago and contrasts with 14.3-percent growth in sales in July.

The growth of industrial output in August narrowed from 6.4-percent in July and saw an average two-year growth of 5.4 percent, according to NBS. The August figure missed expectations for a 5.8-percent growth by both Reuters and Bloomberg.

However, high-tech manufacturing grew by 18.3 percent year on year, 2.7 percentage points faster than July. The output of new energy vehicles, industrial robots and integrated circuits went up by 151.9 percent, 57.4 percent and 39.4 percent from a year earlier respectively. ""In August, the national economy maintained the trend of recovery. However, we must be aware that the international environment is still complicated and severe,"" the NBS statement said. ""At home, it has been felt that the sporadic outbreak of COVID-19 and natural disasters such as floods had caused an impact on the economy, and the foundation for the economic recovery still needs to be consolidated.""

Fixed asset investment, a gauge of expenditures on items including infrastructure, property, machinery and equipment, increased 8.9 percent in the first eight months. The figure was against Reuters' expectation of 9 percent and compared with a 10.3-percent jump in the January-July period. August data ""were all below consensus forecasts for a consecutive month, confirming our view that markets have significantly underestimated the scale of the growth slowdown in the second half of the year,"" Lu Ting, chief China economist at Nomura, said in a note. Nomura sees three major growth headwinds in coming months: COVID-19 and China's ""zero-COVID"" strategy, the country's unprecedented tightening measures on the property sector and exceptionally aggressive measures to curb carbon emissions. ""We expect markets to cut their GDP growth forecasts for the third quarter and fourth quarter further,"" said Lu. The current consensus forecasts are at 5.6 percent and 4.7 percent respectively, versus Nomura's 5.1 percent and 4.4 percent respectively. The surveyed jobless rate remained unchanged from July and stood at 5.1 percent in August, according to the NBS. China has set a target of a 5.5 percent unemployment rate for the whole year."
China sees fewer air trips amid COVID-19 resurgence,"China's civil aviation industry saw a decline in the number of air trips and volume of mail and cargo in August amid a recent resurgence of COVID-19, official data showed Tuesday.

About 22.41 million passenger trips were made last month, a decrease of 51.5 percent from a year earlier, according to statistics released by the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) at a press conference.

The number of trips is about 36.6 percent of that recorded in the same period in 2019, the CAAC said.

The volume of mail and cargo transported stood at 520,000 tonnes, down 5.6 percent year on year, while the total air transport turnover dropped by 35.6 percent year on year to 4.91 billion tonne-km, according to the CAAC.

The eastern province of Jiangsu, where China's recent COVID-19 resurgence first emerged, last week announced that it has cleared all high- and medium-risk areas.

Despite being restrained by recent COVID-19 cases, air travel demand is expected to be unleashed during the upcoming Mid-Autumn Festival holiday and the National Day holiday, CAAC official Shang Kejia said.

As the latest booking data from online travel agencies showed, the number of air passenger trips will rise notably during the two holidays from the July-August level, Shang said.

To meet the growing demand, the CAAC will help airlines better plan transport capacity, schedules and air routes. It has also advised several airlines to increase the number of flights for the holidays.

This year's Mid-Autumn Festival holiday lasts from September 19 to 21, while the National Day break runs from October 1 to 7."

The International Finance Corporation (IFC), the private sector arm of the World Bank, on Tuesday announced the launch of a competition to stimulate growth of businesses in Kakuma and Kalobeyei refugee camps in northern Kenyan county of Turkana.

IFC said in a statement released in Nairobi, the Kenyan capital, the competition that runs from Sept. 14 to Nov. 5 encourages businesses to submit proposals for funding and training aimed at facilitating their growth.

Other entities supporting the Local Enterprise Development Competition include Nairobi-based non-profit group, Africa Enterprise Challenge Fund (AECF), Turkana county government and UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR).

The broader goal of the contest is to support private sector development and job creation in the vast and drought-prone Turkana County, empower refugees and host communities.

""This competition demonstrates IFC's commitment to local businesses in Kenya and our efforts to uplift host communities and refugees with private sector solutions,"" said Jumoke Jagun-Dokunmu, IFC's regional director for Eastern Africa.

Jagun-Dokunmu noted that Kakuma refugee camp and the adjacent region has untapped business potential that requires adequate funding and training to unlock and create new jobs for the youth.

Overseen by Kakuma Kalobeyei Challenge Fund (KKCF) which is a joint initiative of IFC and AECF, the Local Enterprise Development Competition focuses on market-led solutions to economic and social challenges facing refugees and their host communities.

Winners of the contest will be announced in early 2022 and will leverage new funding and capacity development to expand their businesses, transform the lives of refugees.

AECF's CEO Victoria Sabula said the competition targets small and medium-sized enterprises owned and operated by residents of Turkana county including refugees. The competition will pay special attention to businesses owned by women and youth that require capital injection to expand their geographical reach as they generate employment.

The winners of the third edition of Local Enterprise Development Competition will receive performance-based grants ranging from 1.5 million shillings (about 13,648 U.S. dollars) to 5 million shillings besides advisory support focusing on marketing, financial management and publicity."

The World Bank on Tuesday projected Somalia's economy to grow at 2.4 percent in 2021. /Xinhua

The World Bank on Tuesday projected Somalia's economy to grow at 2.4 percent in 2021, rebounding from the ""triple shock"" that ravaged the country in 2020 -- COVID-19, flooding, and the locust infestation.

In its latest Economic Update, the World Bank said this growth momentum is expected to continue in the medium term and reach pre-COVID-19 levels of 3.2 percent in 2023.

""As Somalia embarks on the road to recovery from the triple shocks, policy interventions that raise productivity, create jobs and expand pro-poor programs will be key,"" said Kristina Svensson, the World Bank country manager for Somalia, during the virtual launch of the report.

According to the report, the economy of Somalia contracted 0.4 percent in 2020, less severe than the 1.5 percent contraction projected at the onset of the global pandemic.

Higher-than-anticipated aid flows, fiscal policy measures put in place by the government to aid businesses, social protection measures to cushion vulnerable households, and higher-than-expected remittance inflows mitigated the adverse effects of the triple shock.

And the disruptions stemming from COVID-19 containment measures reduced federal and state revenue collection while increasing pressure to spend more on health and disaster relief, said the report, noting large increases in external grants enabled the government to begin rebalancing public spending toward economic and social services and to provide funds for new social programs and emergency response projects to increase resilience.

John Randa, World Bank senior economist, said support for the health sector is an essential component of resilient and inclusive development and investing in health sets Somalia on a path to reaping substantial demographic dividends from improvements in life expectancy and reductions in fertility.

The lender said interventions to improve the investment climate and encourage the formalization of businesses to attract more private investment would include reforms focused on reducing the cost of electricity and improving on its reliability, leveling the playing field among private firms, reducing red tape, and broadening financial inclusion."

China's first batch produced C919 jet to enter final assembly,"China's first batch production of the C919 passenger plane is set to enter its final assembly, said the country's aviation regulator on Monday.

The phased progress marks a milestone in the C919 program since the batch production of the aircraft launched in 2019, the East China Regional Administration of the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) said on its official WeChat account.

The C919 program's Production Certificate Board (PCB) met in Shanghai on September 10 and reviewed the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China's (COMAC) reports on batch producing the jet, the CAAC said.

The first of five homemade jetliners is expected to be delivered to China Eastern Airlines by the end of the year.

COMAC won its first-ever commercial contract for the C919 in March.

The regulators said the PCB has also approved proposals to adjust the current plans to obtain the aircraft's production certificate, which is required for mass production.

A part of China's drive to develop homemade civil airplanes, the C919 is expected to compete with medium-range aircraft from the two global giants, such as Airbus A320 and Boeing 737 MAX."
"China Evergrande expects property sales fall, liquidity deterioration","China's leading developer China Evergrande said it expects a ""significant continuing decline in contract sales"" in September in an exchange filing on the progress of recent measures to ease liquidity on Tuesday.

September is typically when real estate companies in China record higher contract sales of properties, the group said in the filing with the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong.

However, ""the ongoing negative media reports concerning the group have dampened the confidence of potential property purchasers in the group,"" it added.

With the expected further decline in September sales, it will thereby result in ""the continuous deterioration of cash collection by the group, which would in turn place tremendous pressure on the group's cash flow and liquidity,"" Evergrande said.

According to the filing, the contract sales of properties of the indebted group amounted to 71.63 billion yuan (about $11.1 billion) in June, 43.78 billion yuan in July, and 38.08 billion yuan in August this year, showing a decreasing trend.

The group also said measures it has taken to ease the liquidity issues have not reached expected outcomes, including no material progress made on the sales of part of China Evergrande New Energy Vehicle Group Ltd. and Evergrande Property Services Group Ltd.

Broader default risk

In the filing, Evergrande said two of its subsidiaries had failed to uphold guarantee obligations for 934 million yuan worth of wealth management products issued by third parties.

That could ""lead to cross-default"", which ""would have a material adverse effect on the group's business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations,"" it said.

Evergrande said it has appointed Houlihan Lokey and Admiralty Harbour Capital as joint financial advisers, which will assess the group's capital structure, evaluate its liquidity, explore solutions to ease the current liquidity stress and reach an optimal solution for all stakeholders as soon as possible.

In a statement on Monday, Evergrande refuted online discussion about a bankruptcy and said a restructuring of the company was ""totally untrue"", but added that it has ""indeed encountered unprecedented difficulties.""

S&P Global Ratings downgraded Evergande's rating to ""CCC"" in August, just two weeks after another earlier downgrade.

In July, China's largest rating agency, China Chengxin International Credit Rating, downgraded Evergrande's outlook to ""negative.""

Canton Fair to resume offline exhibition,"The 130th session of the China Import and Export Fair, also known as the Canton Fair, will resume offline activities, organizers said Tuesday.

The fair, scheduled to kick off next month in south China's Guangdong Province, will be held both online and offline, Vice Minister of Commerce Ren Hongbin told a press conference.

The event will last five days and feature only one phase compared with three phases in previous sessions in view of the current pandemic control situation. The offline exhibition will cover an area of 400,000 square meters while 60,000 online booths will be set up for the virtual event, he added.

Founded in 1957, the Canton Fair is seen as a significant barometer of China's foreign trade.

The upcoming session will be the fair's first time to be held online and offline concurrently, Ren said, adding that it demonstrates the country's determination in further opening-up."
South Korea fines Google $177m for abusing market dominance,"South Korea's antitrust regulator on Tuesday fined Alphabet's Google 207 billion won ($176.64 million), saying the U.S. technology giant abused its dominant market position to restrict competition in the mobile operating system (OS) market.

The Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) investigated Google for allegedly preventing local smartphone makers from customizing its Android OS.

The fine is the latest antitrust setback for Google in South Korea. Earlier this month, parliament passed a bill to ban major app store operators such as Google from forcing software developers to use their payment systems and effectively stopping developers from charging commission on in-app purchases.

KFTC said the fine could be the ninth-biggest it has ever imposed.

It said Google has hampered market competition by requiring smartphone makers to abide by an ""anti-fragmentation agreement (AFA)"" when they sign key contracts with Google regarding app store licences.

Under the AFA, device makers were not allowed to install modified versions of Android, known as ""Android forks,"" on their devices.

This practice has helped Google cement its market dominance in the mobile OS market, the KFTC said.

Google was not immediately available for comment on Tuesday."
China Development Bank to offer 2 tln yuan in loans for central region,"The China Development Bank plans to issue two trillion yuan ($310 billion) in loans to the country's central region for priority projects during the national 14th Five-Year Plan period (2021-2025).

The funds will support industrial modernization, rural-urban coordination, ecological development and transport infrastructure improvements, the bank said.

During the 13th Five-Year Plan period (2016-2020), the bank issued 2.7 trillion yuan in loans to the central region, focusing on supporting advanced manufacturing, major infrastructure, ecological and environmental protection, poverty alleviation, and rural revitalization.

Growth momentum in central region

Cong Liang, deputy head of the National Development and Reform Commission, told a press conference that the region enjoys robust growth momentum and can achieve high-quality development.

During the last plan period, the region recorded an average annual economic growth rate of 8.6 percent, ranking first among the four regions in the country, Cong said. The area sustained its economic growth in the first half of this year, with its total gross domestic product reaching 11.8 trillion yuan¡£

The central region includes Shanxi, Anhui, Jiangxi, Henan, Hubei and Hunan provinces. Its permanent population is nearly 365 million, accounting for more than a quarter of China's total.

In July, the country issued a guideline on promoting the high-quality development of the region in the new era, detailing measures to promote the area's economic growth, scientific and technological innovation, urbanization, green development, opening-up and people's well-being.

Deng Xiangyang, vice governor of Anhui Province, said the provincial government would leverage its advantages in technological innovation and contribute to the development of the whole region.

Building on its current technology edges, Anhui would strive to break new ground in cutting-edge technologies such as quantum information, thermonuclear fusion, and advanced light sources while building itself into an influential technological innovation center, said Deng.

Yin Meigen, vice governor of Jiangxi, said the province would promote opening-up at a higher level. The province, neighboring the opening-up vanguards of Zhejiang and Guangdong, pledged efforts to build its open economy pilot zone with high standards and quality. It also vowed to optimize its business environment and make full use of national development strategies like the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area development.

Shanxi, a coal-rich province, puts its focus on the reform of the energy industry. It would double down on meeting carbon-emission intensity targets set by the central government, improve energy supply quality, and cut pollution and carbon emissions in key areas, said Vice Governor Wei Tao.

According to the July guideline, the region should put a modern economic system in place by 2035, basically accomplish socialist modernization, and make substantial headway in common prosperity.

OPEC expects Delta variant to delay oil demand growth,"Oil pumping jacks, also known as ""nodding donkeys,"" at an oilfield. /CFP

Oil pumping jacks, also known as ""nodding donkeys,"" at an oilfield. /CFP

OPEC on Monday trimmed its world oil demand forecast for the last quarter of 2021 due to the Delta coronavirus variant, saying a further recovery would be delayed until next year when consumption will exceed pre-pandemic rates.

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) said in a monthly report it expects oil demand to average 99.70 million barrels per day (bpd) in the fourth quarter of 2021, down 110,000 bpd from last month's forecast.

""The increased risk of COVID-19 cases primarily fueled by the Delta variant is clouding oil demand prospects going into the final quarter of the year,"" OPEC said in the report.

""As a result, second-half 2021 oil demand has been adjusted slightly lower, partially delaying the oil demand recovery into first-half 2022.""

Governments, companies and traders are closely monitoring the speed that oil demand recovers from last year's crash. A faster return, as predicted by OPEC, could boost prices and challenge the view that the impact of the pandemic may curb consumption for longer or for good.

Oil was trading above $73 a barrel after the report was released. Prices have risen over 40 percent this year, boosted by economic recovery hopes and OPEC+ supply cuts, although concern about the Delta variant has weighed.

Despite the downward revision to the fourth-quarter, OPEC said world oil demand in the whole of 2021 would rise by 5.96 million bpd or 6.6 percent, virtually unchanged from last month.

The growth forecast for 2022 was adjusted to 4.15 million bpd, compared to 3.28 million bpd in last month's report and an estimate of 4.2 million bpd given by OPEC sources during the group's last meeting on September 1.

""The pace of recovery in oil demand is now assumed to be stronger and mostly taking place in 2022,"" OPEC said.

""As vaccination rates rise, the COVID-19 pandemic is expected to be better managed and economic activities and mobility will firmly return to pre-COVID-19 levels."""
China encourages consolidation in the 'overly scattered' NEV sector,"China will encourage new energy vehicle (NEV) companies to consolidate as a way to make better use of resources, an official said on Monday.

There are currently too many NEV companies in China, and the sector is in a scattered state, said Xiao Yaqing, minister of industry and information technology.

Xiao recognized that high enthusiasm for the development of new energy vehicles has fueled the growth of the sector. However, he cautioned that due to the high technical requirements involved, resources should be concentrated in a market-oriented way.

""We'll give the full play to the role of the market and encourage companies to merge or reorganize to become bigger and stronger,"" said Xiao.

The minister added that China will speed up building the charging network and continue to support NEV sales in the rural market.

Sales of NEVs in China hit a new high of 321,000 units in August, up by 180 percent year on year, industry data showed.

In the first eight months of 2021, NEV sales surged by 190 percent year on year to 1.8 million units in the country, according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers.

China issues 2.7 billion organic product labels in 2020,"China issued a total of 2.7 billion organic product labels last year, the country's top market watchdog said Monday.

The country sold 999,000 tonnes of organic products in 2020, with sales standing at 80.43 billion yuan (about $12.47 billion), an increase of 18.6 percent compared with 2019 and ranking the fourth globally, according to the State Administration for Market Regulation.

To date, China has granted 14,000 companies nationwide more than 22,000 certificates for their organic products, the regulator said.

It added that the number of issued certificates grew by 13.52 percent on average each year between 2016 and 2020.

The administration said measures will be adopted to ramp up market regulation and expose illegal cases to target irregularities in the organic product market.

China urges internet companies to rectify link blocking issues,"China will strengthen administrative guidance on web link blocking and urge internet enterprises in violation of the rules to rectify themselves, said officials with the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) on Monday.

This is part of a special six-month campaign launched in July to regulate the internet industry by tackling problems such as market order disruption, infringement of user rights and data security threat.

""Ensuring that legal web links can be accessed normally is a basic requirement for the development of the internet industry. Limiting identification, analysis and normal access of web links without proper reason has affected user experience, damaged users rights and disrupted market order,"" said Zhao Zhiguo, director of the Cybersecurity Management Bureau of the MIIT.

Zhao said the ministry chose to adopt measures such as administrative guidance because some internet companies were failing to ensure compliance even during the self-inspection and rectification period. In this way, companies can better understand that interconnection is an inevitable choice for the high-quality development of the internet industry, he added.

Enterprises are required to follow the rectification requirements and solve link blocking issues in a phase-wise manner, adding that the ministry will deal with the companies lagging behind in complying with the laws and regulations.

According to the Securities Times newspaper, Tencent said it firmly supported the ministry's decision and would implement it in phases and steps.

Alibaba said interconnection is the original intention of the internet, and openness is the foundation of the digital ecology. The company will follow the relevant requirements of the MIIT and work with other platforms, according to bjnews.

On September 9, the MIIT held a meeting with tech companies, including Alibaba, Tencent, ByteDance and Baidu, to ask them to stop blocking each other's website links from their platforms before September 17.

The MIIT listed three requirements at the meeting. For example, the display and access should be consistent for the legal links of the same type of products or services shared by users. After clicking the link, it should directly open in the form of a page within the application when users send and receive legal links.

Also, no additional steps should be attached to a specific product or service link, so users don't need to manually copy the link and open it on the system browser.

One of the world's largest stainless steel producers going green,"The city of Ningde in east China's Fujian Province is home to one of the world's largest stainless steel producers. And as China continues to spare no effort to achieve carbon neutrality, the company is also going green.

The tip of a ballpoint pen is the most crucial part. But manufacturing this tiny part requires high-precision machinery and extremely thin steel.

As small as this ballpoint pen tip is, it has taken China ¨C the world's largest ballpoint pen producer ¨C years to shake off reliance on imports to create it.

Tsingtuo Group is one of the largest producers of such materials. The stainless steel produced by the group meets the requirements for making ballpoint pens. And it already accounts for 20 percent of China's market share.

China used to rely on imported feedstocks to make ballpoint pen tips until 2017 when a domestically developed stainless steel model only 2.3 millimeters thick came out.

In 2020 Tsingtuo Group unveiled a product that was only 1.6 millimeters thick. The keyword behind this is technological innovation.

""The traditional ballpoint pen tip steel is made of lead. Lead has a certain degree of toxicity. Therefore, during research and development, we are pursuing non-toxic and harmless materials,"" said Xi Feifei from the Tsingtuo Research Institute of Tsingtuo Group.

And the company is putting more effort into going green. It has set up systems to monitor the energy consumption of its factories. They will be compared to national and even world standards.

""We have invested 300 million yuan in building two three million-tonne stainless steel waste treatment systems. This is one of the world's leading cases of stainless steel slag and it can be processed without leaving the industrial park,"" said Zhong Shengjiang, executive general manager at Tsingtuo Group.

The company has also made considerable investments in the new energy sector. Facing a harder cap on carbon emissions and a higher goal of carbon neutrality, it's worth watching how manufacturers like Tsingtuo look towards carbon neutrality while continuing development."

On his visit to Jilin, Lei also met with the province's top officials, including Jing Junhai, secretary of the Jilin Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China. Jing said he hoped Xiaomi would strengthen cooperation with China FAW Group as well as Jilin's auto industry chain.

Lei said the company will take the initiative to strengthen cooperation with Jilin automotive enterprises to better solidify the foundation of automotive production and strive to create high-quality automotive products.

It is reported that Xiaomi plans to launch its first car in 2024 and launch a new car annually for three consecutive years after 2024, with a total sales volume of 900,000 vehicles in the three years, according to Sina News citing a source.

Xiaomi announced in early September that it has completed the official business registration for its electric vehicle (EV) unit, Xiaomi EV, which was a milestone in its push into the country's automotive sector.

Xiaomi EV was registered in Beijing and opened with a registered capital of 10 billion yuan ($1.55 billion). Some 300 employees have so far been hired for the EV unit and it continues to recruit talent.

The smartphone maker, which surpassed Apple to become the world's second top-selling brand behind Samsung in the second quarter of 2021, confirmed its foray into the EV sector in March, pledging to invest $10 billion over the next 10 years.

Last month, Xiaomi purchased autonomous driving technology startup DeepMotion for over $77 million to boost its research and development. It is reported that earlier in August Xiaomi had entered talks with Evergrande Group to purchase a stake in the latter's automotive unit.

China has become the world's biggest electric car market in the past decade. Data shows that China's EV sales increased 8 percent to 1.3 million units in 2020, compared with 2019. The country exported 41 percent of the total sales worldwide.

The EV sales will reach about 9 million units in China by 2030, representing an annual growth rate of 24 percent, according to a forecast by consultancy McKinsey.

China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology has held a meeting with tech companies including Alibaba and Tencent to tell them to stop blocking each other's website links from their platforms, Chinese newspaper The 21st Century Business Herald reported on Saturday.

The ministry on Friday proposed standards for instant messaging services to the companies, telling them all platforms must be unblocked within a timeline, according to the newspaper citing sources.

Companies at the meeting on Friday included Alibaba, Tencent, ByteDance, Baidu, Huawei and Xiaomi.

China's internet is dominated by a handful of technology giants who have historically blocked links and services by rivals on their platforms, creating what analysts have described as ""walled gardens.""

It is an increasingly prominent problem after the internet economy has shifted from personal computers to mobile phones, said Liu Xu, a research fellow at the National Strategy Institute of Tsinghua University.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, Tencent's WeChat and Ant Group's Alipay became the most commonly used health code scanning terminals, indicating users' dependence on WeChat and Alipay, Liu said.

""However, Tencent and Alibaba, along with Alibaba's affiliate Ant Group have formed two ecosystems that cannot be interconnected, which is not good for users. Meanwhile, it also forces other internet companies to take sides from the two,"" said Liu.

Liu said an example for the problem caused by the mutual block was that the health code of Alibaba's DingTalk could not be shared on the WeChat platform in March last year, which caused the DingTalk users to encounter difficulties in resuming work across provinces.

In July, the Wall Street Journal reported that Alibaba and Tencent were gradually considering opening up their services to each other, such as by introducing Tencent's WeChat Pay to Alibaba's Taobao and Tmall e-commerce marketplaces.

"Toyota, Honda oppose U.S. House electric vehicle tax plan","Toyota and Honda on Saturday sharply criticized a proposal by Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives to give union-made electric vehicles (EVs) in the U.S. an additional $4,500 tax incentive.

Toyota said in a statement that the plan unveiled late Friday discriminates ""against American autoworkers based on their choice not to unionize.""

The bill, set to be voted on Tuesday by the Democratic-led House Ways and Means Committee as part of a proposed $3.5 trillion spending bill, would benefit Detroit's Big Three automakers, which have union-represented auto plants.

In a statement, Honda called the bill ""unfair"" and said it ""discriminates among EVs made by hard-working American auto workers based simply on whether they belong to a union. ""The Honda production associates in Alabama, Indiana and Ohio who will build our EVs deserve fair and equal treatment by Congress.""

The proposal, estimated to cost $33 billion to $34 billion over 10 years, would boost to up to $12,500 the maximum tax credit for EVs, up from the current $7,500. The $12,500 figure includes a $500 credit for using U.S.-produced batteries.

The proposal is a key part of Democratic President Joe Biden's goal to ensure EVs comprise at least 50 percent of U.S. vehicle sales by 2030 and boost American union jobs.

The bill, however, does away with phasing out automakers' tax credits after they hit 200,000 electric vehicles sold, which would make General Motors and Tesla eligible again. It would also create a new smaller credit for used EVs of up to $2,500.

As of Friday, the market cap of stablecoins stood at roughly $125 billion, according to industry data site CoinMarketCap. It is unclear which financial regulations apply to these relatively new products.

U.S. financial regulators are working to understand the risks and opportunities posed by cryptocurrencies to the traditional U.S. financial system and plan to issue a number of reports on the subject in coming months, they said.

In July, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said the government must move quickly to establish a regulatory framework for stablecoins.

In a sign those efforts are gathering pace, Treasury officials this week met with financial industry executives to discuss potential stablecoin regulation, the three sources said.

Two of the people said that in meetings this week, one of which took place on Friday, officials asked whether stablecoins would require direct oversight if they become extremely popular. They also discussed how regulators should try to mitigate the risks of too many people trying to cash in their stablecoins at the same time, and whether major stablecoins should be backed by traditional assets.

Officials also asked about how stablecoins should be structured, how they could be used, whether the current regulatory framework is sufficient, and other safety and soundness issues, one of the people said.

Treasury officials also met earlier in the week with a group of banks and credit unions to discuss similar issues, another of the people said. Treasury officials appeared to be gathering information and did not share their thinking on how stablecoins should be regulated, this person added.

The information gathered at this week's meetings is likely to help shape a broad Treasury report on stablecoins expected in the coming months.

In a statement, Treasury spokesman John Rizzo said the department is examining ""potential benefits and risks of stablecoins for users, markets, or the financial system.""

""As this work continues, the Treasury Department is meeting with a broad range of stakeholders, including consumer advocates, members of Congress and market participants,¡± he added.

Washington policymakers worry the rise in privately-operated currencies could undermine their control of the financial and monetary systems, increase systemic risks, promote financial crime, and hurt investors.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency are also working on cryptocurrency projects, they have said."

The 30th anniversary of the establishment of dialogue relations between China and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) takes place in 2021. Since the Framework Agreement on China-ASEAN Comprehensive Economic Cooperation was signed in 2002, the two sides have made important progress in cooperation in trade and investment.

Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, China and ASEAN became each other's largest trading partner for the first time in 2020. In the first half of this year, bilateral trade exceeded $410 billion, up 38.2 percent year on year. ASEAN remains China's largest trading partner, and their cumulative investment exceeds $310 billion.

Since the pandemic broke out, China and ASEAN have joined hands to fight the virus and overcome the difficulties together, Chinese President Xi Jinping said in a congratulatory letter sent on September 10 to the 18th China-ASEAN Expo and China-ASEAN Business and Investment Summit, which are held in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region from September 10 to 13.

At the China-ASEAN foreign ministers' meeting in August, Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi called for cooperation in vigorously promoting economic recovery between the two sides.

He said China would like to work with ASEAN to implement the ASEAN Comprehensive Recovery Framework, and forge their all-round recovery cooperation with trade and investment cooperation as the basis.

Here is a quick view of what has been achieved between China and ASEAN in economic cooperation."

A U.S. judge on Friday ordered Apple to loosen control over its App Store payment system, a blow to the global tech giant sparked by its antitrust battle with Fortnite maker Epic Games.

In a ruling with significant potential to alter the digital economy, Apple will no longer be allowed to force developers to use its tightly controlled sales tool.

It's a change loudly demanded by app producers because of the up to 30 percent commission on purchases, however the judge also ruled that Epic had not proved its claim of illegal monopoly -- which prompted a sigh of relief from Apple.

Lawsuits, rules and probes have piled up for the iPhone maker, but it was noncommittal about challenging the ruling and instead lauded the antitrust portion by saying: ""We consider this a huge win for Apple.""

Epic for its part branded the judgment as essentially a loss for app developers who rely on the App Store in the multibillion-dollar mobile gaming industry, and for consumers.

""We will fight on,"" Epic CEO Tim Sweeney tweeted, and a company spokesperson later confirmed they would appeal.

Friday's order says Apple is permanently barred from prohibiting developers from including in their apps ""external links or other calls to action that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms.""

""Apple enjoys considerable market share of over 55 percent and extraordinarily high profit margins... [but] Success is not illegal,"" California federal Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers wrote.

""Epic Games failed in its burden to demonstrate Apple is an illegal monopolist,"" she added.

The decision noted that Apple violated California's laws against unfair competition, however.

The two firms clashed in a lawsuit over whether Apple has the right to set ground rules, control payment systems and kick out apps from its marketplace that fail to comply.

Also at stake was Apple's slice of revenue from iPhone apps of as much as 30 percent.

Apple booted Fortnite from its online mobile marketplace after Epic released an update that dodged revenue sharing with the iPhone maker.

A win for Apple?

However, even before Friday's decision Apple started to cede ground on its App Store dominance, including in an agreement with Japanese regulators.

It also faces the legislation adopted by South Korean lawmakers, which banned Apple and Google from forcing app developers to use the tech giants' payment systems.

Analyst Carolina Milanesi noted the anti-trust aspect of the case was what really had Apple's attention, with a ruling against it potentially opening the doors for challenges from lawmakers and prosecutors.

""For me, it is a win for Apple in that the judge clearly said they are not engaging in monopolistic behavior,"" she told AFP. ""I don't think it is a problem for Apple from a revenue perspective.""

Some US lawmakers also noted the antitrust aspect of the case could not be ignored, noting courts have not tackled the issue.

""Congress must enact rules of the road to ensure free and fair competition online,"" said the joint statement from representatives Jerrold Nadler and David Cicilline.

""It is clear that courts continue to narrowly interpret the antitrust laws in favor of monopolies and against consumers, workers, and small businesses,"" he added.

Apple opened its App Store in July 2008, a year after the release of the first iPhone.

The shop, stocked with mobile apps tailored for devices powered by iOS mobile software, was quickly imitated by rival smartphone makers.

It ignited an entire economy where developers big or small could make money with ""an app for that,"" from games or social networking to summoning car rides or ordering food.

The App Store ¨C the lone gateway onto the more than one billion iPhones in use around the world ¨C has grown to include more than 1.8 million apps."

U.S. producer prices increased solidly in August, leading to the biggest annual gain in nearly 11 years, suggesting that high inflation is likely to persist for some time as the unrelenting COVID-19 pandemic continues to pressure supply chains.

Strong demand and supply constraints were underscored by other data on Friday showing the pace of inventory accumulation at wholesalers slowed in July. It is now taking wholesalers the fewest months in seven years to clear shelves.

""Supply chain bottlenecks have persisted longer and more intensely than most predicted at the beginning of this year, and widespread labor shortages are among the main input issues producers are dealing with,"" said Will Compernolle, a senior economist at FHN Financial in New York. ""This means consumer price inflation should remain elevated for a while.""

The producer price index for final demand rose 0.7 percent last month after two straight monthly increases of 1.0 percent, the Labor Department said. The gain was led by a 0.7 percent advance in services following a 1.1percent jump in July.

A 1.5 percent increase in trade services, which measure changes in margins received by wholesalers and retailers, accounted for two-thirds of the broad rise in services. Goods prices jumped 1.0 percent after climbing 0.6 percent in July, with food rebounding 2.9 percent.

Transportation and warehousing prices shot up 2.8 percent.

The latest global wave of COVID-19 infections, driven by the Delta variant of the coronavirus, has disrupted production at factories in Southeast Asia, key raw materials suppliers for manufacturers in the United States.

In the 12 months through August, the PPI accelerated 8.3 percent, the biggest year-on-year advance since November 2010 when the series was revamped, after surging 7.8 percent in July.

Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the PPI gaining 0.6 percent on a monthly basis and rising 8.2 percent year-on-year.

Stocks on Wall Street were lower. The dollar was steady against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell.

Logistics delays

Though surveys from the Institute for Supply Management this month showed measures of prices paid by manufacturers and services industries fell significantly in August, they remained elevated. Factories and services providers still struggled to secure labor and raw materials, and faced logistics delays.

This was corroborated by the Federal Reserve's Beige Book report on Wednesday compiled from information collected on or before August 30 showing ""contacts reported generally higher input prices but, as with labor, they were mostly concerned about getting the supplies they needed versus the price.""

The supply bottlenecks are making it harder for businesses to restock after running down inventories in the first half of the year. In a separate report on Friday, the Commerce Department said wholesale inventories rose 0.6 percent in July after surging 1.2 percent in June. Sales increased 2.0 percent. At July's sales pace it would take wholesalers 1.20 months to clear shelves, the fewest since July 2014, from 1.22 in June.

""Producers are struggling to replenish their stockpiles against surging demand,"" said Matt Colyar, an economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania.

With inventories tight, producers are easily passing on the higher costs to consumers. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has steadfastly maintained that high inflation is transitory.

Though most economists share this view, some argue that strong wage growth from a tightening labor market suggests inflation could be more persistent.

""Today's data on wholesale prices should be eye-opening for the Fed, as inflation pressures still don't appear to be easing and will likely continue to be felt by the consumer in the coming months,"" said Charlie Ripley, senior investment strategist at Allianz Investment Management."
Chinese regulators tell DiDi and Alibaba to better protect workers,"Chinese regulators on Friday gathered 10 leading delivery and ride-hailing companies for a meeting to give guidance on better protecting labor rights amid new forms of employment.

The meeting, which focused on improving how platform firms distributed incomes and ensured rest periods for workers, was in conjunction with Ministry of Transport, the State Administration of Market Supervision and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security said in a statement posted on its official WeChat account.

The regulators delivered the message to 10 companies, including Meituan, DiDi Global, Alibaba Group's Ele.me and Tencent Holdings.

The meeting was a follow-up to guidelines drafted in July by regulators for food delivery platforms to guarantee their workers' income was above minimum pay levels.

In August, the Ministry of Transport said it was considering setting an upper limit on commission taken by ride-hailing platforms.

China has escalated anti-trust efforts, sought to curb disorderly expansion of capital and carried out a series of reforms to its tax system, as well as enhanced healthcare, jobs and market regulation, as part of a big picture plan to achieve ""common prosperity"" in all aspects.

Other than delivery and ride-hailing sectors, the gaming industry has also been targeted.

China has cut minors' time on online games to three hours per week. On Wednesday, the authorities summoned leading online gaming companies, including Tencent and NetEase, to ensure strict compliance with the latest rules.

"August: China vehicle sales fall on chip shortages, but NEVs thrive","In the first eight months of 2021, China's vehicle sales jumped by 13.7 percent year on year. /CFP

In the first eight months of 2021, China's vehicle sales jumped by 13.7 percent year on year. /CFP

The decrease in China's vehicle sales for a fourth consecutive month widened to 17.8 percent in August from a year earlier, weighed on by the continued global shortage of semiconductors, data from the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM) revealed on Friday.

The data showed that the overall sales in China stood at 1.8 million vehicles in August.

The CAAM attributed the fall in August to two factors. First, a COVID-19 surge in Malaysia has led to tight production and supply of automotive-grade chips, and the shortage of chips for enterprises has further intensified.

Still, due to the high base effect in the same period last year, the year-on-year decline in passenger car production and sales has widened compared with the previous month, the CAAM added.

Second, the change in national emission regulations in China caused a short-term market fluctuation, which affected the demand for trucks, and the production and sales of commercial vehicles, the CAAM said.

In the first eight months of 2021, China's vehicle sales jumped by 13.7 percent from the same period a year ago, as the market recovered from COVID-19 lows."

U.S. private equity giant Blackstone has abandoned its $3.05 billion bid to take full control of SOHO China Ltd., the office developer said in an exchange filing on Friday.

The U.S. private equity giant's investment vehicle in the deal, Two Cities Master Holdings II, had decided not to make the offer, the filing said.

The U.S. private equity firm in June offered HK$5 per share, 31.6 percent higher than SOHO China's closing price at the time, in what would have been its largest real estate deal in China.

The companies gave no details of the reasons for the deal falling through.

Reform of China's tax system under common prosperity goal,"Editor's note: China let some people ""get rich first"" four decades ago as the then poor country opened up and introduced a market economy. Now rising to become the world's second largest economy and officially getting rid of extreme poverty in a nation of 1.4 billion people, China has been increasingly emphasizing its higher goal, to strive for ""common prosperity"" in all aspects, so that all can share the fruit of the economic and social progress. CGTN will run a series of stories to look into how the new policy shift has been reflected in reforms of its tax system, education, healthcare, jobs, market regulation and other fields. Here is the first episode. To begin with, common prosperity has a strong connection with wealth distribution, including the first, second and the third distribution. The first distribution means one's earnings under the market rule; the second one is redistribution through government measures such as taxation; the third distribution is of moral strength, such as donations. And these all have something to do with taxes. Taxes can be either direct or indirect. A direct tax is a tax that a person or organization pays directly to the entity that imposed it. An indirect tax is collected by one entity in the supply chain and paid to the government, before passing to the consumer as part of the purchase price of a good or service. From the perspective of the average proportion of various taxes in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries in recent years, most of the dominant taxes are direct taxes.

However, the indirect taxes are at the center of the tax structure in China, including the value-added tax, consumption tax and tariff. The large proportion of indirect tax affected the fair distribution of social wealth and hindered consumption, as the channels through which taxes are used to regulate residents' disposable income are relatively narrow. But in recent years, China has promoted the tax system reform, so the tax structure has been further optimized. For example, the reform in 2018 raised the income tax threshold from 3,500 yuan ($543) to 5,000 yuan per month, in a bid to adjust income distribution and expand middle-income groups. The same year, the country also added special additional deductions from taxable incomes for children's education, continuing education, treatment for serious diseases, caring for the elderly, as well as housing loan interests and rents. The move helped reduce residents' burden based on their differentiated needs. The proportion of direct taxes, including individual income tax, business income tax and property tax, has gradually increased from 28.4 percent in 2011 to 34.9 percent in 2020, data from the Ministry of Finance showed. The 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-2025) for National Economic and Social Development and the Long-Range Objectives through the Year 2035 launched last year also said the country will properly increase the proportion of direct tax and establish local tax system. In May, the Minister of Finance Liu Kun stated in the article ""Establishing and Improving a Modern Fiscal and Taxation System Conducive to High-quality Development"" published by the Economic Daily, that the direct tax system will be improved, the proportion of direct tax will be gradually increased. The country is also steadily advancing real estate tax legislation and reform.

Distribution and donation The third distribution is about donation, which still needs room to grow in China. Compared with mature economies, China's proportion of donation in GDP is relatively low. And, most of the donors in China are companies, while in other countries, individual donors play a bigger role, Lu Zhengwei, chief economist of the Industrial Bank told CGTN. ""It also has something to do with the tax system and tax rate, as many countries have tax credits to motivate donors,"" Lu said. China can exempt tax in donation to encourage more people to donate. It can also use core socialist values to encourage people with higher income to donate, Yu Miaojie, deputy dean of National School of Development, Peking University, told CGTN. ""All kinds of enterprises should take on more social responsibilities, whether it is a state-owned enterprise or a private one,"" Yu said. Property tax Property tax has been discussed for a long time but it is hard to be fully deployed because of the complicated situation of China's housing market, various tax types related to real estate, and the different reality of cities. Efforts have been steadily made in recent years. Shanghai and Chongqing have started levying property taxes on individual residential properties on a trial basis in 2011. The 14th Five-Year Plan also proposed to promote legislation on property tax. In May this year, the Ministry of Finance, the Budget Commission of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, the Housing Ministry and the State Taxation Administration solicited opinions from representatives, experts and scholars on a pilot scheme for implementing the property tax. ""In due time, the country can levy national property tax as housing is for living in, not for speculation. It may help reduce some distortions in the real estate market,"" Yu said.

China-ASEAN trade to boost post-pandemic recovery: Malaysian PM,"In his virtually delivered speech at the 18th China-ASEAN Expo (CAEXPO), Ismail Sabri urged both parties to work together, to continue embracing multilateral and open trade relations to facilitate the region in weathering the crisis.

Malaysian Prime Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob said Friday that intensified trade activity between China and members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) would boost the post-pandemic economic recovery.

""As outlined in the ASEAN Economy Recovery Framework, we have to strive to keep the supply chain connectivity uninterrupted, and to facilitate the movement of essential goods and services.""

""By removing unnecessary barriers to trade, and by rolling-back on new restrictive trade measures, we will be bringing ourselves closer to pre-pandemic economic growth rates,"" he said.

He also said the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), the world's biggest trade pact, will serve as an integral tool that helps navigate the region towards recovery and future growth.

The RCEP, which was finally signed after eight years of negotiations, demonstrates to the world that ASEAN, together with its free trade agreement (FTA) partners, including China, is committed to the transnational supply chain and keeping markets open amid the ravages of a global pandemic, he said.

He noted that economic cooperation is crucial for small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which have formed the backbone of Malaysia's economy and will benefit from Chinese-led digitalization.

""It is timely for both ASEAN and China to promote cooperation in digital economy partnership, thus, facilitating the acceleration of technology adoption among SMEs,"" he said.

He also suggested that opening up travel bubbles, recognition of vaccination certificates and quarantine arrangements could be explored between China and ASEAN to revive not only the tourism industry, but also people-to-people connectivity.

The 18th CAEXPO is taking place both online and offline in Nanning, capital of south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, according to the organizer.

This year's expo will help expand the platform functions of the expo. It will also further serve the construction of the Belt and Road Initiative and the RCEP.

In 2020, trade between China and the ASEAN reached $684.6 billion, bucking the trend to post a year-on-year increase of nearly 6.7 percent.

China has remained ASEAN's largest trading partner for 12 consecutive years since 2008 and in 2020, ASEAN also became China's largest trading partner."
New Development Bank expands membership and moves to new building,"The addition of new members is a critical milestone for the New Development Bank (NDB) since it's the first entry into more emerging markets, said Leslie Maasdorp, vice president and CFO of NDB.

The NDB, which was backed by the BRICS nations, has announced it will welcome the United Arab Emirates, Uruguay, and Bangladesh as new members on September 2. These three nations are not included in BRICS, but have all shown an interest in promoting sustainable development.

Maasdorp thinks this move will help to diversify their portfolio and broaden their reach in sustainability development. The decision was a new step for the bank's new model of development in emerging market, said Maasdorp in an interview with CGTN.

As NDB welcomes new members, it's also moving to the new office in Shanghai as well. The building took four years to complete, and boasts an overall floor area of 126,000 square meters, which can allow nearly 2,000 people to work here. The official move will take place on September 28.

Since its establishment in 2015, the bank has approved some 80 projects and $30 billion of loans. The covered sectors include transport, energy and most recently, public health infrastructure to help member countries to fight COVID-19 pandemic.

Maasdorp emphasized their efforts in infrastructure and renewable projects. For instance, the NDB is initiating rooftop solar projects in Lingang, Shanghai. As indicated by Maasdorp, the bank's focus will be a continued deepening in infrastructure development in the future.

Maasdorp admitted pandemic in the past year and a half changed NDB's investment strategy, as the developing world might urgently need more medical infrastructure than roads and ports. But he added, once the most urgent need for medical support is no longer the issue, NDB will go back to its normal mandate of sustainable infrastructure building.

When asked about the possible experience for the world to learn from, Maasdorp said the multilateral institutions has proved its significance and ability to solve transnational challenges like COVID-19 pandemic and climate change for the world and particularly, emerging market."
What's behind Foxconn's new round of recruitment in C China,"Apple supplier Foxconn's factory in the central China city of Zhengzhou has announced a mass recruitment drive to meet production needs before the new iPhone series launch in mid-September.

The factory needs 200,000 extra workers ahead of the iPhone 13 launch, Wang Xue, the deputy general manager of the Foxconn plant in Zhengzhou, told CGTN on Tuesday.

While Foxconn has been continuing its recruitment push, the company still needs new candidates, particularly in the production lines for new iPhones.

To draw more workers, Wang said the company is ""raising one-time bonuses for new candidates from around 9,800 yuan ($1,518) in July to over 10,000.""

The Foxconn factory is also employing other channels such as internal recommendations, to recruit new candidates, another hiring staff member at the plant told CGTN.

Wang said that support from the local government shouldn't be underestimated.

""The local government has provided job-seekers with convenient services, like free nucleic tests and shuttle buses to pick them up from more than 20 areas across the province,"" Wang explained.

Through its own recruitment channels and local government support, Wang said the company has reached two-thirds of its recruitment target so far.

With mass recruitment continuing in China, sources said Foxconn once planned to shift parts of its production to Vietnam and India to take advantage of the cheaper workforce in those countries, although the company has denied it.

Ma Liang, a professor from the School of Public Administration and Policy at Renmin University of China, told CGTN that China's higher labor force quality and industrial ecosystem were behind Foxconn's recruitment expansion.

""Labor skill and management in southeast Asian countries is on the low side compared with China,"" said Ma, noting that China has a huge and complete industrial ecosystem that can offer strong support for giant companies.

Meanwhile, COVID-19 has caused rising labor and raw materials costs.

""Situations in southeast Asian nations like India are not ideal in terms of COVID prevention and control, which has slowed down their forward pace on mass production, while China has sought a balance between its virus fight and work resumption,"" Ma continued.

On the increased market expectation and demand for new iPhones, some believe that the U.S. crackdown on Huawei has accounted for it, but for Ma, it has only partially benefited Apple's market share, while the ""global economic recovery from the pandemic is the main reason."""

China to soon launch the southbound leg of China Bond Connect,"China will launch a cross-border wealth management project and a southbound leg of the Bond Connect program in the next few days, said an official from the country's central bank.

Hong Kong and Macao investors will be able to continue expanding their investment in the Chinese mainland capital and bond markets, said Pan Gongsheng, deputy head of the People's Bank of China, at a news conference.

The Bond Connect program, launched in July 2017, is a mutual market access scheme that allows overseas investors to invest in the Chinese mainland's interbank bond market using financial institutions on the mainland and in Hong Kong.

Pan said a couple of financial pilot projects have been put into operation in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, including Hengqin and Qianhai.

Over the past week, China has issued a general plan for building a Guangdong-Macao in-depth cooperation zone in Hengqin and a plan for further developing a cooperation zone for the southern metropolis of Shenzhen and Hong Kong.

Afghanistan 2001-2021: The skyline and the slum,"Editor's note: The Afghanistan war ended just as it began. The country has once again come to a crossroads as the U.S. pulled its traumatized soldiers out of its longest war in history, with the Taliban riding back to power they had been stripped of 20 years ago. Afghanistan, a mountainous territory nestled in the heartland of Asia, has long been a battlefield of global powers. But it has never been conquered, and hence had the sobriquet of the ""Graveyard of Empires."" In this series ""Through the lens: Afghanistan 2001-2021,"" we dive into the scars the war has left on the country, and the fear, wrath and resilience of the Afghan people. Our sixth article focuses on the country's widening wealth gap. You can find the whole series here.

Two worlds, starkly different, heave in sight when you survey the city of Kabul from a height. One is the world of the rich ¨C cavernous mansions fringed in lush green gardens, surrounded by limpid swimming pools and white sun loungers. Outside the fortified, separated ""arcadia"" is a world of destitution ¨C sprawling crude slums, children leaning against a wall riddled with bullet holes, everything shrouded in dusty grey. With the international aid influx that came along with the U.S.-led invasion in 2001, Afghanistan saw its economy soar, interlaced with rapid urbanization. In 2009, foreign aid flows reached a record high, standing at around 100 percent of Afghanistan's GDP. Between 2003 and 2012, its GDP growth averaged 9.4 percent owing to a booming tertiary sector which was heavily dependent on foreign aid, according to World Bank figures. Per capita income surged from $210 in 2004 to $700 in 2013 annually. Wealth was rapidly accumulated, but largely confined to the rich and powerful in the country's six major cities. Kabul was considered the world's fifth fastest growing city in the mid-2010s, as people fled violence in rural areas to the capital city and expanded its edges. Buildings towered up in what used to be one-story shabby homes, transforming the city's skyline dramatically. There are egregiously wealthy urbanites well-connected with senior government officials, and internally displaced slum-dwellers for whom the fast urbanization means higher consumer prices and housing bubbles.

An aid-dependent economy is prone to crumble. Aid dropped starting the early 2010s together with a declining number of American troops (from over 130,000 in 2011 to 15,000 in 2014). What ensued was a shrinking service sector and surging unemployment because foreign troops and military contracts created plenty of construction, logistics, catering and retail jobs for local civilians. By 2020, international aid dropped to some 43 percent of Afghanistan's GDP.

More Afghans live under the national poverty line. Some 38 percent of the populations lived in poverty in 2011 and 2012, but five years later this percentage exceeded 54 percent. Kabul alone has some 30 slums, housing 75 percent of the city's residents ¨C a much higher proportion than the average 33 percent across developing countries, revealed by UN figures. Eight out of 10 Afghan adults don't have a bank account, which could partly be contributed to deep-rooted financial illiteracy as 76 percent of the poor are illiterate. Inequalities are widening in light of the unsustainable economic growth pattern and the oblivion of the upper class toward the poor. ""The poorest 20 percent of the population experienced a 2-percent decline in real per capita expenditure while the richest 20 percent saw a 9-percent increase,"" says a World Bank report on Afghanistan's poverty status.

Besides, the poor have been missing out on child education, the information revolution, and the opportunity to return to their rural homes, while the urban elite frequently post their glitzy interiors and luxury travels on social media. The digital divide is clear: Only 22 percent of the Afghan population have access to the internet.

Some basics of the Afghan economy Afghanistan is one of the least developed countries in the world. Being a landlocked nation on a dry, rugged landscape, Afghanistan is not geographically advantageous to develop a strong, self-sufficient economy. Agriculture is the mainstay of its economy. According to the World Bank, 80 percent of the population earn a living in agriculture and animal husbandry. While contributing a bulk of the national income and employment, agriculture in Afghanistan is far from being an efficient industry. The country lacks modern agricultural facilities and technology. Most farmers still adopt the traditional way of farming, and are at the mercy of the weather. Despite agriculture generating more than 20 percent of the GDP, Afghanistan's food production still cannot support its own demand, having to import a large amount of food annually. Decades of warfare and instability have further exacerbated the fragility of the country's economy. The abundance of mineral resources in Afghanistan, especially lithium and rare earth elements ¨C trillions of dollars' worth of resources ¨C however, remain untapped as the unending conflicts destroyed the industrial infrastructure and distracted the government from focusing on the development of the mining sector. Afghanistan's annual import far exceeds its export, leaving it in heavy deficit for years. In 2020, its imports amounted to $6.54 billion compared to the exports worth only $776 million. From 2001 to 2019, Afghanistan received around $77 billion from international aid, according to the World Bank. In the Brussels Conference on Afghanistan in 2016, the international community committed $15.2 billion to the reform of Afghanistan in the next four years. Last year, 75 percent of the government budget, and 43 percent of the country's GDP, was through foreign aid, which was already the lowest level of aid flows.

Yellen urges Congress to raise debt limit,"U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on Wednesday warned that the U.S. could default on its debt in October if the Congress does not make efforts to raise the debt limit.

In a letter to lawmakers, Yellen said after the debt limit was reinstated on August 1, Treasury began employing certain extraordinary measures to continue to finance the government on a temporary basis. Once all available measures and cash on hand are exhausted, the U.S. would be unable to meet its obligations for the first time in history, she said.

""Based on our best and most recent information, the most likely outcome is that cash and extraordinary measures will be exhausted during the month of October,"" she wrote.

She cautioned that ""a delay that calls into question the federal government's ability to meet all its obligations would likely cause irreparable damage to the U.S. economy and global financial markets.""

""At a time when American families, communities, and businesses are still suffering from the effects of the ongoing global pandemic, it would be particularly irresponsible to put the full faith and credit of the United States at risk.""

FILE PIC: Kenya plans to improve its business environment in order to attract foreign investors into the country, a senior government official said on Wednesday. /Getty Images

Kenya plans to improve its business environment in order to attract foreign investors into the country, a senior government official said on Wednesday.

Adan Mohamed, Cabinet Secretary for East African Community and Regional Development told journalists in Nairobi that the investment climate will be enhanced through redesigning service delivery processes to eliminate compliance burden for foreign firms relocating to Kenya.

""By improving the business regulatory environment, Kenya will become the preferred investment destination in Africa,"" Mohamed said.

Mohamed said that some of the measures to be undertaken will reduce the cost associated with a wide array of critical business processes such as commercial litigation, company registration and paying taxes.

According to the ministry, dozens of multinationals already operate in Kenya due to its improving investment climate.

Mohamed revealed that foreign companies will play a role in stimulating economic growth and job creation.

He observed that Kenya is prioritizing business reforms in order to address challenges faced by the private sector that reduce the attractiveness of Kenya as an investment destination.

The Kenyan official added that business reforms are even more critical if Kenya is to attract more foreign investors to take advantage of the African Continental Free Trade Area.

He noted that Kenya is keen to attract foreign investors in order to achieve the country's economic blueprint, the big four agenda that focuses on agriculture, manufacturing, universal health care and food security."

Chinese authorities on Wednesday summoned leading online gaming companies, including Tencent and NetEase, to ensure strict compliance with the latest rules.

China has set age and time limits on playing online games. The crackdown comes after recent media reports exposed the widespread availability of rental accounts enabling youngsters to disguise their real identity to play games beyond the specified limit.

Authorities stressed that online gaming companies and platforms have to strictly implement the time limit set for minors, ensure they don't get access to rental or sales of accounts.

Users under 18 are only allowed to play online games from 8 p.m. to 9 p.m. on Fridays, weekends and official holidays, the Chinese regulator said in a notice released in late August.

Tencent responded on Monday that it is notifying or suing more than 20 game account trading platforms to demand an end of their illegal service.

Tencent shares were down more than 8 percent while NetEase fell 11 percent at market close in Hong Kong on Thursday.

China's securities regulator pledges more support to real economy,"China's securities regulator has pledged more support to advance a ""virtuous cycle"" between the real economy and the capital market.

China will further strengthen the role of market function in serving the real economy while guarding against capital idling and risk accumulation, said Yi Huiman, chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, at the World Federation of Exchanges annual meeting on Tuesday in Shenzhen.

Facing multiple challenges including the pandemic, rising commodity prices and disrupted supply chains, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are having a hard time, and extending support to foster their development is a major task for global economic recovery, Yi noted.

He pledged efforts to deepen reforms of the New Third Board, set up the Beijing stock exchange and speed up fostering a full-chain institutional system for the capital market to serve the innovation and development of SMEs.

As part of the efforts to deepen reforms of the New Third Board, China recently announced the decision to set up the Beijing stock exchange.

Built upon the New Third Board, the Beijing bourse will host eligible companies traded on the equity exchange platform and pilot the registration-based IPO system.

Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the BRICS countries ¨C Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa ¨C have carried out extensive cooperation in trade and finance and made positive contributions to the global fight against the COVID-19 and economic recovery.

The BRICS countries have reached broad consensus and cooperation in supporting small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), accelerating the development of the digital economy, strengthening partnerships in the new industrial revolution, and promoting trade and investment facilitation.

The five emerging countries collectively represent 42 percent of the global population, 24 percent of the global GDP, 18 percent of the global trade, and 25 percent of the world's foreign investment, according to data from the Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM).

A big integrated market is being built to help member countries overcome difficulties amid the pandemic, provide the impetus for the economic recovery of the member countries and maintain the safe and smooth operation of global industrial chain and supply chain.

The member countries are pushing for the implementation of BRICS Strategy 2025, which will help SMEs to better integrate into the global value chain, Chen Chao, deputy director general of the Department of International Trade and Economic Affairs at the MOFCOM, said Monday.

Proposed in November last year, BRICS Strategy 2025 sets the framework for cooperation among its members, including embracing the digitalization wave and reducing potential risks on international markets.

The pandemic has fueled the boom of many new industries. BRICS members are accelerating establishing partnerships in the new industrial revolution and focusing on cooperation in the digital economy, such as 5G, big data, artificial intelligence and cloud computing."

The labor union representing American Airlines pilots said it will begin informational picketing in coming weeks at the carrier's major hubs to protest their work schedule, fatigue and lack of adequate accommodation over the summer.

The Allied Pilots Association will picket at Miami International Airport, Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport, and other locations, it said in an emailed statement to Reuters.

""Our airline needs scheduling practices that support the safety margin, respect pilots' and passengers' needs, and de-risk American Airlines to protect and improve revenue,"" the union said.

American did not immediately respond to a request for comment outside regular business hours.

In August, a union representing Southwest Airlines pilots filed a lawsuit challenging forced time off and other changes to working conditions imposed by the airline during the COVID-19 pandemic."
White House calls on Congress to pass funding bill to avoid shutdown,"The White House budget office on Tuesday called on U.S. Congress to pass a short-term funding bill to avoid a potential federal government shutdown as current government funding is set to lapse at the end of September.

""With the end of the fiscal year rapidly approaching, it's clear that Congress will need to pass a short-term continuing resolution (CR) to provide more time for the FY 2022 process to unfold,"" Shalanda Young, acting director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, said in a White House blog post.

""The window provided by a short-term CR will allow movement toward bipartisan agreement on smart, full-year appropriations bills that reinvest in core priorities, meet the needs of American families, businesses and communities,"" she said.

Young also called on Congress to include additional funding in a CR to help respond to recent and ongoing natural disasters, including Hurricane Ida, as well as paying for the relocation of tens of thousands of Afghans into the United States.

""I'm looking forward to continued engagement with members of both parties and on both sides of the Capitol to get the job done,"" she said.

The Biden administration's request for more funding for the Afghanistan relocation and disaster relief programs is likely to provoke substantial debate in Congress, where Republicans have hammered the White House for its handling of the withdrawal of U.S. troops to end the Afghan war, according to The Washington Post.

Meanwhile, Congress is also facing an imminent deadline over the debt ceiling, the total amount of money that the U.S. government is authorized to borrow to meet its existing legal obligations.

The Congressional Budget Office has warned that the United States is at risk of a default in October or November unless Congress raises or suspends the debt ceiling.

Libby Cantrill, head of public policy at PIMCO, a global investment management firm, believed the most plausible way forward is that Democrats try to attach a debt ceiling suspension to a government funding bill, which needs to pass to avoid a government shutdown.

""Depending on how it plays out, we could see Congress shut down the government before ultimately coming to a deal on the ceiling, similar to what happened in October 2013,"" Cantrill wrote in a recent analysis.

""As it did then, a shutdown could create volatility in financial markets and potentially affect the calculus of the Federal Reserve's timing on tapering its asset purchases,"" she wrote.

The Fed has pledged to keep its benchmark interest rate unchanged at the record-low level of near zero, while continuing its asset purchase program at least at the current pace of $120 billion per month until ""substantial further progress"" has been made on employment and inflation."

China's forex reserves fall in August,"China's foreign-exchange reserves fell to $3.2321 trillion at the end of August, down $3.8 billion from a month earlier, official data showed Tuesday.

The volume went down 0.12 percent from the end of July, said the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE).

China's foreign-exchange market operated smoothly last month, with domestic supply and demand generally balanced, said Wang Chunying, deputy director and spokesperson of the SAFE.

The country's forex reserves remained generally stable, with the total amount standing above $3.2 trillion for four consecutive months, said Wen Bin, chief analyst at China Minsheng Bank.

China's exports maintained rapid growth this year, driven by the sustained recovery of the world economy, said Wen, noting that the increase in exports and the attractiveness of RMB assets consolidated the stability of the country's foreign-exchange reserves.

Wang attributed the August decline in foreign exchange reserves to the combined impact of currency translation and changes in asset prices.

Affected by factors such as the progress of the COVID-19 pandemic and expectations of major countries' fiscal and monetary policies, the dollar index slightly increased, said Wang. She added that weakened non-dollar currencies and the change of asset prices led to the fall of China's foreign-exchange reserves.

Despite uncertainty and fluctuations in the global financial situation triggered by the raging pandemic, the Chinese economy maintains a steady recovery. Its development quality continues to improve, which helps with the overall stability of foreign exchange reserves, Wang said.

In the next stage, China's policies to increase support for key areas and weak links, along with new measures to deepen opening up in the financial and foreign-trade areas, will shore up the stability of the country's foreign-exchange reserves, said Wen.

Warning of the potential risks resulting from the unbalanced recovery of the world economy, Wen suggested stepping up efforts to boost domestic demand and striking a balance between ensuring steady growth and guarding against risks."

Glass recycling firm offers route toward carbon reduction goals,"China's goal of attaining carbon neutrality by 2060 is an effort from all sectors. In east China's Shanghai, a company that has the world's largest waste-glass treatment capacity aims to curb carbon emissions through glass recycling.

Since Shanghai rolled out its garbage sorting campaign, it's been a bit tricky finding the right cans to toss your trash in. But that also means opportunities for recycling companies.

After dropping a waste beer bottle in the neighborhood, the bottle will be transferred to a larger garbage sorting station where different types of glass are sorted in a more organized manner. Glass generated from construction waste and beverage bottles are segregated.



Wang Haiqin, owner of Garbage Sorting Station, said recycled garbage is already sorted in the neighborhood. ""We just sort them out again to make sure. We can get three to four tonnes of glass. Most of them are wine bottles,"" Wang said.

Once the garbage sorting station collects ten tons of glass, the waste is transferred to a larger area for delivery to a factory for actual recycling.

Shanghai generates more than 800,000 tonnes of glass waste every year. It's an urgent task to come up with high-end technology to process it all efficiently.

The Shanghai Yanlongji Group, a glass recycling firm, began using its automatic optical sorting line in 2018. In the past, glass sorting was done manually. But automation helps make the glass recycling process more efficient. The firm can recycle 2 million tonnes of waste glass annually, the largest capacity worldwide.



Yao Yuan, president assistant of Yanlongji, said that one worker can only sort 2 tonnes of glass every day. But one production line can sort 60 tonnes an hour. The recycled glass is sold to glass manufacturers for producing windows, beverage bottles and car parts.

Yao said the company has yet to break even. One production line costs more than $12 million, but 1 tonne of recycled glass is worth less than $100. The company still believes the technology will yield positive returns someday, as garbage sorting becomes widespread across China, he said.

""The recycled glass can help reduce the use of minerals which are used to produce brand new glass, and that will also help to reduce carbon emissions. Using recycled glass to produce new glass will also reduce the use of fuel oil,"" Yao said.



As more cities enforce garbage sorting, glass recycling is expected to become more efficient and lucrative. Shanghai's Yanlongji Group plans to set up seven new factories nationwide.

Amy Cai, partner of PwC China ESG Managing, stressed the necessity of changing managers' mindsets from short-term profit pressure to green, long-term development.

""Most of the CEOs at the moment, globally, have already taken a green agenda as part of their overall strategy,"" Cai said, adding that this is a compliance requirement and also a market opportunity, and a way for Chinese companies to go global."
China to roll out pilot scheme of green electricity trading,"China will roll out a scheme of green power trading in an effort to build a new power system with new energy as a mainstay and achieve China's goals of peak emissions and carbon neutrality, the National Development of Reform Commission (NDRC) said on its website on Tuesday.

Carrying out green power trading will distinguish some users who are willing to take on more social responsibilities to directly trade with wind and photovoltaic power projects, the NDRC said.

The commission said that the proceeds generated through the transactions will be used to support the development and consumption of green power and to better promote the construction of the new system.

Under the guidance of the NDRC and the National Energy Administration, the pilot will be carried out at power trading exchanges in Beijing and Guangzhou, coordinated by the country's two big grid operators ¨C the State Grid Corp of China and China Southern Power Grid ¨C in formulating detailed rules for such trading and improving the trading platforms' functions, according to the NDRC."

Shipments from the world's biggest exporter in August rose at a faster-than-expected rate of 25.6 percent from a year earlier, also up from a 19.3-percent gain in July, pointing to some resilience in China's industrial sector. Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast a growth of 17.1 percent.

""The ministers have promised to accelerate production and use of vaccines, and secure vaccine allocation through multilateral regional cooperation. They also have agreed to support the World Trade Organization's proposal to temporarily waive intellectual property rights for vaccines and other medical devices,"" said Chen Chao, a senior MOFCOM official.

In a statement released after the meeting, the ministers expressed firm support for the multilateral trade system and opposed unilateral protectionism, Chen said. They also pledged to back reform of the WTO and said they look forward to positive results from the organization's 12th ministerial meeting in November.

The ministers also reached a series of agreements to deepen pragmatic cooperation in trade and commerce, according to Chen.

""The ministers have promised to cooperate in WTO reforms, global supply chains, small and medium-sized enterprises, and international investment. They've also decided to seize the opportunities in the digital economy and green development, and pay attention to artificial intelligence's help in trade,"" he said.

The BRICS countries have large markets, abundant resources and great potential, Chen said, adding that these countries have shown their resiliency and vitality amid the pandemic, injecting an important dynamic in the battle against the virus and pushing forward economic recovery.

The BRICS countries are Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa. Their population makes up 42 percent of the world's total, accounting for 24 percent of global GDP.

Soaring demand for semiconductor chips means the auto industry could struggle to source enough of them throughout next year and into 2023, though the shortage should be less severe by then, Daimler CEO said on Sunday.

Carmakers, forced by the COVID-19 pandemic to shut down plants last year, face stiff competition from the sprawling consumer electronics industry for chip deliveries, hit by a series of supply chain disruptions during the pandemic.

Cars have become increasingly dependent on chips ¨C for everything from computer management of engines for better fuel economy to driver-assistance features such as emergency braking.

""Several chip suppliers have been referring to structural problems with demand,"" Ola K?llenius told reporters during a round table event ahead of the Munich IAA car show. ""This could influence 2022, and [the situation] may be more relaxed in 2023.""

The IAA show is the first major motor industry event worldwide since the COVID-19 pandemic.

Daimler said last week it expected significantly lower third-quarter sales at its Mercedes unit due to a global semiconductor shortage, becoming the latest in a string of automakers to take a hit to revenues.

Automakers from U.S. group General Motors to India's Mahindra and Japan's Toyota have slashed output and sales' forecasts due to scarce chip supplies, made worse by a COVID-19 resurgence in key Asian semiconductor production hubs.

K?llenius said on Sunday that despite the ongoing chip shortage, the German carmaker hopes its own supply of semiconductors will improve in the fourth quarter.

As part of its plans to electrify its model range, Mercedes-Benz will show off several fully electric vehicles (EV) at the show in Munich.

These will include global premiers for the EQE, the first fully electric for the premium carmaker's high-performance AMG brand and a concept car for its luxury Maybach brand. The company will also introduce a fully electric SUV, the EQB, to the European market.

In July, Daimler said it will spend more than 40 billion euros ($47.5 billion) by 2030 to take on Tesla in an all-electric market but warned the shift in technology would lead to job cuts.

Outlining its strategy for an electric future, the German carmaker said it will build eight battery plants as it ramps up EV production, and from 2025, all new vehicle platforms will only make EVs.

K?llenius said the company's plan to spin off its trucking unit Daimler Trucks by the end of 2021 remains on track."

Beijing unveils plan to build international consumption center city,"Beijing on Sunday unveiled measures including the opening of thousands of new stores in the next five years to build itself into an international consumption center city.

In an implementation plan for this goal, issued by the Beijing Municipal Commerce Bureau, the city said it will carry out specific projects including those focusing on new consumption landmarks, new brands, digital consumption and the development of cultural, tourism, sports, education and medical consumption.

Over 3,000 first, innovation and flagship stores of brands from both at home and abroad are expected to open by 2025 in Beijing. The capital will also build about 10 cluster areas featuring domestic time-honored brands and incubate more than 100 new consumption brands.

Through five years of efforts, Beijing will basically become an international consumption center city with global influence, competitiveness and reputation, said Yan Ligang, head of the Beijing Municipal Commerce Bureau.

In July, China approved Shanghai, Beijing, Guangzhou, Tianjin and Chongqing to take the lead in building international consumption center cities."
China's vice premier says support for private sector 'won't change',"China's support for private businesses has not changed now, and won't change in the future, Chinese Vice Premier Liu He said Monday at the opening ceremony of the 2021 China International Digital Economy Expo.

Liu said China will vigorously support growth of the private sector, as it can play a great role in stabilizing employment, adjusting economic structure and promoting innovation.

The private sector has contributed more than 50 percent of tax revenue, over 60 percent of GDP, over 70 percent of technological innovation as well as more than 80 percent of urban employment and has over 90 percent of market players, Liu said in a video speech.

For the development of the digital economy, private companies should have a strong sense of innovation, seize development opportunities and strive to attract and train talents, according to Liu.

The country will continue to improve the legal environment, promote fair competition and oppose monopoly, the vice premier said, and will also resolutely protect property rights, including intellectual property rights."
China issues plan to build Guangdong-Macao in-depth cooperation zone,"China's central authorities have issued a general plan for building a Guangdong-Macao in-depth cooperation zone in Hengqin.

The plan, issued by the Communist Party of China Central Committee and the State Council, was made public on Sunday.

It said building the zone is a major arrangement to enrich the practice of ""One Country, Two Systems"", and will be an important driving force for Macao's long-term development.

Hengqin is located in the southern part of Zhuhai City in Guangdong Province, just across the Macao Special Administrative Region.

The total area of the cooperation zone will be about 106 square kilometers, according to the plan.

The plan defines the strategic position of the zone as a new platform to boost Macao's appropriate economic diversification, a new space that provides convenience to Macao residents' life and employment, a new model to enrich the practice of ""One Country, Two Systems"", as well as a new high ground for building the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area.

The plan sets the goal for the zone to fully demonstrate the strong vitality and strength of ""One Country, Two Systems"" by 2035, when the goal of Macao's appropriate economic diversification will be basically realized.

According to the plan, the cooperation zone will develop new industries to help promote Macao's economic diversification.

Sci-tech research and development and high-end manufacturing will be developed.

Traditional Chinese medicine and other signature businesses of Macao, as well as industries including culture and tourism, conventions and exhibitions, and modern finance will be promoted.

Preferential policies concerning corporate income tax will be improved, the plan said, adding that measures will be rolled out to attract talent from home and abroad.

The cooperation zone will be a new home for Macao residents to live and work, said the plan.

Macao residents are encouraged to find jobs there or create their own businesses. Cooperation between the zone and Macao society will be strengthened in areas concerning people's livelihood. Infrastructure connectivity will also be boosted.

The plan also stressed building an integrated new system with Macao featuring high-level opening-up.

Under the system, declaration procedures for outbound and inbound goods between Macao and the cooperation zone will be further simplified. Inbound and outbound travel will also become highly convenient.

Innovative measures will be introduced in terms of cross-border financial management. A highly convenient mechanism for market access will be established, and efforts will also be made to facilitate the safe and orderly flow of internet data across the border.

An organization will be jointly established to develop and manage the cooperation zone, said the plan.

Party leadership and Party building should be enhanced in an all-around manner to ensure the smooth operation of the cooperation zone. Legal guarantees should also be strengthened, it added."
Companies showcase construction plans for 2022 Winter Olympic Games,"Perhaps nowhere else in the Chinese capital can better demonstrate Beijing's commitment and drive to go green than the Shougang Park.

The Shougang Park is a former steel-making complex that has been turned into a champion of the green lifestyle. It's a convention center now, and it's hosting part of the 2021 China International Fair for Investment and Trade (CIFITS).

Yu Hua, design director of Beijing Shougang Construction and Investment, said she hopes the re-made Shougang Park can give people a ""park-like"" experience, as it has been revamped to be green with trees and flowers as well as green with construction.

""Look at the CIFITS exhibition halls, they are part of our green, low-carbon, reusable efforts. We can dismantle these steel exhibition halls for reuse too,"" she said.

The park will feature in the 2022 Winter Olympic Games too.

Exhibitors at the CIFITS have also brought their ways that will make the Winter Games' other venues smart, multi-functional and energy-saving.

For example, China State Construction Engineering Corporation (CSCEC) No. 1 Bureau's solution that quickly converts the Water Cube, which is the Aquatic Center for 2008 Beijing Olympic Games, into the Ice cube, the sports center for the 2022 Winter Olympic Games.

Yang Xiaoyi, deputy chief engineer at CSCEC, told CGTN that the now Ice Cube is even smarter and more versatile as it can also turn into a convention center.

""Our solution ensures a fast transition between the three different functions, as quickly as in 15 days,"" he said.

The company also shows how tech has made the sports center more ""sensitive"", even caring: it keeps temperature at minus 8.5 celsius at the ice surface, 10 degrees 1.5 meters above the icy surface, and a stable 16 to 18 degrees for spectators.

Beijing Construction Engineering Group is showing how new raw materials for the roads and highways that lead to the 2022 Winter Olympic venues are superior than before. ""They last longer and could better absorb precipitation,"" a staff told CGTN. ""New road materials will also resist frosting, which is important for the Games.""

Founded in 1919, Shougang Group is working to transform its past production premises in Shijingshan District into a new landmark of the capital, featuring winter sports events, fairs and exhibits.

In an effort to reduce air pollution, Shougang initiated its relocation to the Caofeidian port in 2005, the largest industrial relocation in China since the 1960s. The relocation also marked the high-end transition for Shougang."
Beijing Stock Exchange completes business registration,"Beijing Stock Exchange has completed registration with a capital of 1 billion yuan ($155 million), according to the National Enterprise Credit Information Publicity System.

Information on the publicity system website showed that the establishment and approval date of the Beijing Stock Exchange is September 3, and the National Equities Exchange and Quotations (NEEQ) is the only shareholder. The registration authority is the Beijing Municipal Administration for Market Regulation.

China on Sunday started to solicit public opinion for the detailed operation rules of the new stock exchange. The rules were unveiled on the official website of the NEEQ and involved the procedures of listing, trading and membership management of the new bourse.

The Beijing Stock Exchange will generally continue the trading rules of the NEEQ's selected layer in an effort to embody characteristics of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) stock trading and ensure the continuity and consistency of market transactions.

The stock exchange will not limit the price change on the first trading day, but trading will be suspended for 10 minutes when stock prices rise by over 30 percent or drop by over 60 percent. Daily trading movements will also be restricted to within 30 percent after the first day of trading.

The newly-listed companies on the Beijing Stock Exchange should originate from innovative companies that have been listed on the NEEQ for 12 months. The price of targeted issuance should be no less than 80 percent of the market price. The target and price of the issuance should be determined through bidding, and ordinary investors are restricted from selling for no less than six months, according to the draft by the China Securities Regulatory Commission.

Brazil suspends beef exports to China due to mad cow disease cases,"Brazil's government announced on Saturday the suspension of beef exports to China after confirming two cases of atypical mad cow disease in two separate domestic meat plants.

The temporary suspension, which began on Saturday, was declared in compliance with bilateral health protocols.

The measure will remain in place ""until the Chinese authorities complete the evaluation of the information on the cases that has already been delivered,"" said a statement.

According to the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Supply (MAPA), the two cases were reported in the city of Belo Horizonte in the state of Minas Gerais and in Nova Canaa do Norte in the state of Mato Grosso.

Brazil officially notified the World Organization for Animal Health after the cases were confirmed.

The last case of atypical mad cow disease in Brazil was recorded in 2019, and exports to China were also suspended temporarily at that time.

These current cases are the fourth and fifth atypical mad cow disease cases recorded in the country's 23 years of surveillance of the disease. Brazil has never recorded a classic mad cow disease case, according to MAPA."
Afghanistan 2001-2021: The poppies blossom,"Editor's note: The Afghanistan war ended just as it began. The country has once again come to a crossroads as the U.S. pulled its traumatized soldiers out of its longest war in history, with the Taliban riding back to power they had been stripped of 20 years ago. Afghanistan, a mountainous territory nestled in the heartland of Asia, has long been a battlefield of global powers. But it has never been conquered and hence had the sobriquet of the ""Graveyard of Empires."" In this series, ""Through the lens: Afghanistan 2001-2021,"" we dive into the scars the war has left on the country and the fear, wrath and resilience of the Afghan people. Our third article focuses on the country's rural economy and its top cash crop ¨C the opium poppy. You can find the whole series here.

The tall, alluring poppy flower has scarlet red petals and a black heart. But don't be cheated by its captivating appearance. After being dried or boiled into a paste and blended with lime and stimulants in hot water, the silky flowers will become a morphine base which is made into heroin with tints of chemicals. Poppy plantation has an established history in Afghanistan. For decades, foreign invasion and civil conflicts had brewed a mature industry of opium cultivation and drug trade. With plantation starting in scale in the 1950s, the sector boomed in the '80s amid the chaos following the withdrawal of Soviet troops. In 2000, the country's opium poppies made up 72 percent of the world's illicit opium.

The industry went through a temporary bust phase in 2001, hitting a record low, after the Taliban cracked down on opium production with a religious decree in July 2000. It declared planting poppies ""un-Islamic,"" while some experts said they were seeking international legitimacy by doing so. This downtrend was brought to an abrupt end by the September 11 attacks, which killed some 3,000 people and triggered Washington to formulate anti-terrorist initiatives. In the name of the ""war on terror,"" the U.S.-led forces toppled the Taliban regime. Afghanistan was again shrouded in ashes. Corrupt officials, warlords, drug traffickers and militant groups capitalized on the turmoil, fueling a resurrection of the opium industry. Given the complicated, unstable land ownership and management, destitute farmers, most of them with no land rights, were driven to work on poppy fields to make a living. That exacerbates the poverty cycle in rural Afghanistan, in particular exposing women and children to exploitation. In addition, structural unemployment has forced more into this business. Planting poppies could generate a profit 10 times higher than that of other crops.

Opium poppy cultivation reached a record high at nearly 330,000 hectares in 2007. Tens of millions of dollars in opium taxes are incurred every year, on which various forces cash in. The Taliban is believed to have been involved in poppy planting, opium extraction, which could be up to 10 percent, in addition to charging drug smugglers shipment fees. In the meantime, former governments at all levels were also vying to make a profit. ""It is widely alleged that corrupt officials within the Kabul government, the Afghan National Police, and various provincial administrations are also in the pay of opium traffickers,"" said a 2009 report by the U.S. Institute of Peace. The fierce scramble for profit and power leaves farmers few other options than to toil in the poppy fields. Though the U.S. hardly talked about the need to address the illicit trade in public, it spent $8.6 billion to stamp out the opiate trade, according to John F. Sopko, the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction. But it has rarely worked since impoverished Afghans need it to feed their families. Former Afghan President Hamid Karzai once said, ""Either Afghanistan destroys opium, or opium will destroy Afghanistan.""

According to estimates by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), half of the country's GDP has been generated by the opiate economy. One in 10 Afghans is engaged in cultivation or the drug trade, which has largely shaped the modern Afghan economy. The trade has also generated lucrative profits outside Afghanistan, as it's estimated to account for more than 80 percent of the global opium business.

In 2017 Afghanistan's opium harvest surged to 9,000 metric tons, while in 2001, it was only 180 metric tons. A year later, the production witnessed a sharp drop due to a severe drought and household income in gravely affected rural areas fell by half. However, the opiate economy ""was still worth between 6 and 11 percent"" of the country's GDP and provided ""the equivalent of up to 190,700 full-time jobs"" in that year, as was written in the UNODC's Afghanistan opium survey 2018. The latest statistics on opium poppy revealed a steady rise. Despite the pandemic, the poppy cultivation area was estimated at 224,000 hectares, an increase of 37 percent year on year. Twenty-two out of the country's 34 provinces have poppy fields.

Along with the growth of opium production is opium addiction. War, poverty and migration, and easy access to opium, also led more and more Afghans to use drugs. The UN estimates that up to 2.5 million people regularly use drugs, most of whom have quite limited access to treatment. It seems that as instability continues to haunt the country with the Taliban and opposition forces still in battle, the Afghan economy will continue being addicted to opium. The complex confluence of factors ¨C poverty, war-related trauma, lack of job opportunities ¨C will hardly end the opium poppy business any time soon, despite the Taliban's pledge to throttle it. The rural poor have to be given economic alternatives to sustain their life before they come to a cul de sac.

Xiaomi overtakes Apple to become top-shipping wearable band vendor,"Xiaomi overtook Apple to become the top-shipping wearable band vendor in the second half (Q2) of the year, according to a report by market analyst firm Canalys on Thursday.

Xiaomi shipped eight million wearable bands in Q2 with a market share of 19.6 percent, the report showed.

Apple came in the second with a shipment of 7.9 million, a year on year growth of 29.4 percent.

During the same period, Huawei shipped 3.7 million wearable bands, a decrease of 53.9 percent year on year.

""Xiaomi made a wise move to hasten the release of the wristband Mi Band 6, which is a more compelling device than its predecessor,"" said Canalys research analyst Cynthia Chen. ""Xiaomi's quick pivot to basic watches also helped the company boost its wristwatch shipments by 1.3 million units this quarter,"" Chen said, according to the report.

The report also said that wristwatch shipments overtook those of basic bands for the first time in the fourth quarter of 2020, and this trend has continued since then.

Apple still took the lead in the global wristwatch market, with a 31.1-percent market share in Q2 this year. Huawei, Garmin and Samsung came in the second, third and fourth places.

Canalys research manager Jason Low said although many vendors are investing in next-generation health sensors and developing in-house algorithms, health tracking is the most prominent use case for smartwatches. The ability to deliver cutting-edge health-tracking features and to offer users meaningful data and health insights will set winners and losers apart.

""Vendors should focus on giving users insights into health trends involving data collected over a longer period of time, so that they can understand how their lifestyles are affecting their wellbeing,"" Low said."

U.S. probing fatal Tesla crash that killed pedestrian,"U.S. auto safety regulators are investigating a July 26 fatal crash in New York involving a Tesla vehicle that might have been using an advanced driver assistance system, they disclosed on Friday.

New York City police confirmed on Friday an ongoing investigation into the July 26 death of a 52-year-old man attempting to fix a flat tire on his vehicle on the Long Island Expressway when he was struck by a Tesla.

A National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) spokeswoman told Reuters on Friday the agency was aware of the ""July 26 incident involving a Tesla vehicle on the Long Island Expressway in New York, and has launched a Special Crash Investigation team to investigate the crash.""

NHTSA's probe into the New York crash was first reported by Reuters.

Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The U.S. investigations come amid increased scrutiny of Tesla's Autopilot and other driver assistance systems. Tesla's Autopilot handles some driving tasks and allows drivers to keep their hands off the wheel for extended periods.

Last month, NHTSA said it opened a formal safety probe into Autopilot after 11 crashes involving Tesla models and emergency vehicles.

On Wednesday, NHTSA identified a 12th crash involving a Tesla vehicle using an advanced driver assistance system that struck an emergency vehicle in Orlando, Florida.

On Friday, NHTSA released an updated list of special crash investigation crashes that it is reviewing, in which advanced driver assistance systems are suspected of being used including the New York crash involving a 2021 Tesla Model Y as well as a crash in Florida.

NHTSA has opened 33 investigations into Tesla crashes involving 11 deaths since 2016, in which use of advanced driver assistance systems was suspected. NHTSA has ruled out Autopilot use in three of those non-fatal crashes."

The Nasdaq closed Friday at a fresh record but Wall Street's main indexes headed into the Labor Day weekend in mixed fashion, reacting to a disappointing U.S. jobs report which raised fears about the pace of economic recovery but weakened the argument for near-term tapering.

A majority of the 11 S&P sectors ended lower, with the energy and financial indexes among those finishing in the red.

Banking stocks, which generally perform better when bond yields are higher, dropped even as the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield jumped following the report.

""The number's a big disappointment and it's clear the Delta variant had a negative impact on the labor economy this summer,"" said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors in Boston.

""You can tell because leisure and hospitality didn't add any jobs and retail actually lost jobs. Investors will conclude that perhaps this will put the [Federal Reserve] further on hold in terms of the timing of tapering. Markets may be okay with that.""

Among the biggest decliners on the S&P 500 were cruise ship operators, including Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings, Carnival Corp. and Royal Caribbean Cruises, whose businesses are highly susceptible to consumer sentiment around travel and COVID-19.

The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq had scaled all-time highs over the past few weeks on support from robust corporate earnings, but investors have remained generally cautious as they watch economic indicators and the jump in U.S. infections to see how that might influence the Fed and its tapering plans.

The labor market remains the key touchstone for the Fed, with Chair Jerome Powell hinting last week that reaching full employment was a prerequisite for the central bank to start paring back its asset purchases.

On Friday, the Labor Department's closely watched report showed nonfarm payrolls increased by 235,000 jobs in August, widely missing economists' estimate of 750,000. Payrolls had surged 1.05 million in July.

Despite a number well outside the consensus estimate, the overall reaction of investors was muted, continuing a trend over the last year of a decoupling of significant S&P movement in the wake of a wide miss on the payrolls report.

Unofficially, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 74.47 points, or 0.21 percent, to 35,369.35, the S&P 500 lost 1.41 points, or 0.03 percent, to 4,535.54 and the Nasdaq Composite added 32.34 points, or 0.21 percent, to 15,363.52.

The Nasdaq, registering a fifth daily gain in the last six sessions, was boosted by technology heavyweights, including Apple, Alphabet, and Facebook. Tech stocks tend to perform better in a low interest-rate environment.

Oil dips

Oil prices declined on Friday as market sentiment was dented by the U.S. jobs report.

The West Texas Intermediate for October delivery lost 70 cents to settle at $69.29 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude for November delivery decreased 42 cents to close at $72.61 a barrel on the London ICE Futures Exchange.

Traders were also assessing the damage in the U.S. Gulf Coast due to Hurricane Ida.

The U.S. Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement on Friday estimated that 93.33 percent of current oil production in the Gulf of Mexico was shut in, along with 89.25 percent of natural gas production.

For the week, the U.S. crude benchmark rose 0.8 percent, while Brent climbed 1.3 percent, based on front-month contracts.

China to draw foreign investors into commodities futures trading,"China will launch more futures contracts, including a shipping futures contract, and accelerate efforts to bring in more overseas investors to trade in its futures market, the State Council said on Friday.

The country will also establish an international, yuan-denominated commodity futures market, it said in a statement on promoting trade and investment in its free-trade zones.

Foreign companies and investors currently have limited access to China's vast commodities markets. Contracts that are open to foreign traders include crude oil, iron ore, TSR 20 rubber, low-sulphur fuel oil and bonded copper.

""[China will] accelerate the introduction of overseas traders, build an international commodity futures market priced and settled in renminbi, and develop widely representative futures prices that domestic and foreign traders will recognize and participate in,"" according to the State Council statement.

The statement also said the country will launch pilot schemes for intellectual property rights securitization in qualified free-trade zones based on high-value patent portfolios of industries.

It will also allow qualified financial leasing firms in free-trade zones to share foreign debt quotas with their special purpose vehicles under the macro-prudential framework for cross-border financing.

Digital economy empowers China's development in post-COVID era,"The digital economy has effectively supported China's economic development and has expanded during COVID-19, and it will continue to power the country in the post-pandemic era, China's Vice Minister of Commerce Wang Bingnan said on Friday at the China International Fair for Trade in Services (CIFTIS) in Beijing.

The world is entering a period of rapid development of the digital economy and China is a frontrunner in the field, Wang told a forum on digital trade at CIFTIS. The country's digital economy reached 39.2 trillion yuan ($6.07 trillion) in 2020, accounting for 38.6 percent of GDP, up 2.4 percentage points compared to the year before, he added.

The digital economy is transforming many traditional industries and, as one of China's major traditional growth engines, trade is especially witnessing significant changes.

An important part of the digital economy, digital trade is becoming a new form of global trade and drives future trade development, said Wang.

Digital trade has developed at a faster speed in the past decade than other forms of trade, including goods and services. From 2010 to 2019, the goods trade grew by 31 percent and the service trade by 54.9 percent, whereas digital trade grew by 70.3 percent, according to data released from the forum.

During the pandemic, digital technologies have been widely used, and more trading activities, especially in the service trade, have moved from offline to online. As a result, the trade digitalization progress has been tremendously expedited. With the pandemic still not completely under control globally and the flow of people, logistics and trade activities still restricted, it's all the more important to develop digital trade, said Chen Chunjiang, head of the commerce ministry's trade in services.

Wang announced several plans on how China plans to further develop digital trade during CIFTIS, including accelerating top-level design and launching a strategic layout for digital trade; promoting a higher level of openness and launching a negative list for digital trade; building digital trade pilot zones; strengthening international cooperation; and considering joining the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement."
"Price limits of China's new stock exchange set to 30%, says regulator","The establishment of the Beijing Stock Exchange enhances confidence in SME development and innovation, Chris Liu, senior fund manager of Invesco, said in a note.

The country on Thursday announced it will set up a new stock exchange, in its capital Beijing, and build it into a major base for innovative small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).

The price limits of China's new stock exchange will be set to 30 percent, with no limit on the first day of listing, said an official from China's securities regulator on Friday.

""A new channel for SMEs' direct financing will help boost China's consumption since those companies offered a majority of jobs in China,"" Liu said.

The new exchange, which is set to be the third stock exchange on the Chinese mainland after those in Shanghai and Shenzhen, will augment an existing equity market ¨C the ""new third board,"" according to the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC).

The ""new third board,"" officially known as the National Equities Exchange and Quotations (NEEQ), was launched in Beijing in 2013. It offers SMEs a financing channel with low costs and simple listing procedures, but only allows professional investors to trade equities in those companies.

The Beijing Stock Exchange will trial a registration-based IPO system, said Zhou Guihua, director of the Public Company Department of the CSRC, at a press conference on Friday.

Under the registration-based IPO system, companies seeking an IPO no longer need approval from the CSRC, but apply to stock exchanges based on disclosure rules.

China first introduced the system in Shanghai's Nasdaq-style STAR Market in 2019 and then on Shenzhen's start-up board ChiNext last year.

Implementation of a registration-based IPO system on the new exchange paves the way for the roll-out of a Main Board registration-based IPO system, GAIN Capital said in a note sent to CGTN on Friday.

The Beijing Stock Exchange will copy the basic mechanism from the NEEQ Select Tier and companies listed on the new exchange must have been on the Innovation Tier for more than 12 months, said Zhou.

Currently, there are three NEEQ tiers ¨C Base, Innovation and Select ¨C where listed firms are filtered by quality.

Zhou mentioned the CSRC is soliciting public opinions on related basic systems of the Beijing Stock Exchange."
Xi Jinping says global economic recovery needs 'true multilateralism',"01:05

Chinese President Xi Jinping on Friday said the world economy is undergoing a ""daunting recovery"" which requires ""true multilateralism"" in the face of fresh COVID-19 flare-ups. ""We are ready to work with all parties to uphold true multilateralism, advocate trust and harmony, promote win-win cooperation, and march with firm steps toward the goal of building a community with a shared future for mankind,"" Xi said at the opening ceremony of the plenary session of the sixth Eastern Economic Forum via video link from Beijing. The forum ¨C held in Russia every year since 2015 ¨C has the goal of promoting multilateral cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region. Last year's session was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

In the speech, Xi called for the international community to unite. ""We need to intensify cooperation in vaccine research, development and production, provide more public goods to the international community,"" he said. The Chinese president also voiced opposition to any sort of politicization of COVID-19 vaccines and origins-tracing.

Extra efforts for mutually-beneficial cooperation

""We need to redouble our efforts to advance mutually-beneficial cooperation,"" Xi said at the opening ceremony. He called for the deepening of collaboration between the Belt and Road Initiative and the Eurasian Economic Union in areas including digital economy and climate change. The Chinese president also urged the group to embrace a ""common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security"" by ""narrowing differences"" and ""building consensus through dialogue and exchanges."""
Beijing stock exchange to offer huge financial support for SMEs,"China's decision to set up a stock exchange in Beijing will provide huge financial support for innovation-oriented small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), with the advantage of the capital's financial hub status, an expert told CGTN on Friday.

""The central government will give much importance to the Beijing stock exchange to provide support for SMEs,"" said Wang Dan, chief economist at Hang Seng Bank China.

Wang explained that Beijing has already been China's undoubted financial hub, and that it has the highest influence in the financial market, as the securities regulator headquarters in the capital.

Beijing's level of talent for the capital market, as well as legal and accounting services for listed companies has been much higher than that in other cities, she added.

It will also become an international center for technology innovation, backed by the 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-2025).

Besides, a large number of banks, telecommunications and high-tech companies gather in the capital. ""That will ensure the Beijing stock exchange to be established in an efficient and orderly manner,"" she said.

The economist expected that similar financial institutions may also be established in other inland cities to help local governments achieve their policy goals in the future, once the case in Beijing becomes successful.

The move announced Thursday is an upgrade of Beijing's existing equity exchange for SMEs, known as the National Equities Exchange and Quotations (NEEQ) or the New Third Board, which was launched in the capital in 2013.

The Beijing stock exchange will be built on the basis of the existing NEEQ ""selected-layer,"" and its registration system would be similar to the STAR market in Shanghai. It will be a supplement to the current two main onshore exchanges ¨C Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges.

""Beijing stock exchange is set up to complement the capital market's lack of support for SMEs, which marks a new pattern in China, where three exchanges jointly serve the real economy,"" said Zhang Keliang, general manager of the stock exchange business department of Yintai Securities.

By the end of 2020, a total of 8,187 companies were listed on the NEEQ ¨C among which SMEs accounted for 94 percent, with a combined capitalization of 2.65 trillion yuan ($410 billion), data from the NEEQ website revealed.

China's Alibaba to invest 100 billion yuan for 'common prosperity',"China's e-commerce giant Alibaba Group will invest 100 billion yuan ($15.5 billion) by 2025 to support the country's drive for ""common prosperity,"" the company said Thursday, becoming the latest firm to commit to the national goal of reducing wealth inequality.

Alibaba confirmed that the funds will be used to promote investments in technology, support small and medium-sized enterprises, foster development in rural areas and improve insurance protection for gig economy workers, including deliverymen and ride-hailing drivers.

It will set up a permanent unit to launch the program and establish a 20-billion yuan fund earmarked for common prosperity development.

Alibaba has been under regulatory scrutiny for issues ranging from monopolistic behavior to consumer right infringements. In April, it was fined a record 18.2 billion yuan ¨C 4 percent of its 2019 domestic sales ¨C for violating the country's Anti-Monopoly Law.

WTCA: Globalization is going digital after pandemic,"Editor's note : The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated digital transformation that was already underway. Robin van Puyenbroeck, executive director-business development of the World Trade Centers Association, says digitalization of globalization will be a new trend which will have profound changes in business and people's lifestyles.

A recent survey on globalization conducted by the World Economic Forum shows that people's support for globalization has declined, with half of the people surveyed saying they were unsure of its benefits and a third advocating for trade barriers.

Robin van Puyenbroeck, executive director-business development of the World Trade Centers Association (WTCA), blamed the decline on a general frustration among average people that globalization is not getting better for them, and people are looking for other ways to improve their situation resulting in heightened political rhetoric and measures that are counterproductive.

He said people now see a new phase of globalization ¨C digital globalization. People may be physically distant from their communities because of restrictions, but the world is becoming increasingly interconnected digitally.

The following excerpts from an interview with Puyenbroeck have been edited for clarity and brevity.

CGTN: What's your expectation of globalization in a post-pandemic period?

Puyenbroeck: We can have the conversation on Zoom, while in the past we had to meet in person. So this is really about the world entering into the new phase of digital globalization. We also see that companies gained tremendously resilience, integrated technology more than before, and thrived through the pandemic, just because of their successful transformation of digitalization.

I think the whole work and life balance is shifting. When we reached out for job interviews and spoke to young applicants, one of the first questions is about whether I'm allowed to work from home. It's the younger generation driving us and the economy.

CGTN: Can globalization go back to the pre-pandemic level?

Puyenbroeck: There's no such thing to go back to the old normal. I think the world is changing at a rapid pace, and the pandemic has forced us to make some choices that we have to make over time anyway.

Last year, we did more trade delegations than before. They are virtual trade delegations, but they also work. We all learnt to adapt and find the benefits and efficiency of using zoom and other technology, to do video conferencing, and just work from home.

Shanghai-based company helps build major smart seaport in Israel,"Israel's Haifa New Port, operated by the Shanghai International Port Group (SIPG), officially opened on Wednesday, the first new port opened in the Middle Eastern country for the past 60 years.

It was also the first time Chinese enterprises exported advanced technology and management experience about smart ports to a developed country.

Haifa's travelling crane and storage yard are both operated by an automated system, just like at Shanghai's fourth phase Yangshan Deep-Water Port, which is now the world's biggest automated container terminal, said SIPG vice president Fang Huaijin.

The remote operation system and automated equipment in the new port are also similar to the ones at Yangshan Port, Fang said. But SIPG made adjustments to local conditions in terms of the remote connections to trucks, shipping agencies and freight forwarders.

The port will be the most efficient one in Israel, according to Fang.

Under China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), SIPG won the operating rights of Haifa New Port in 2015, beating international competitors. In 2018, SIPG officially launched the construction project.

Construction on the Haifa New Port Terminal project was planned in two phases. The first was an 805.5-meter shoreline terminal that will have an annual container throughput of more than 1 million TEU (twenty-foot equivalent unit). The second phase will be 715.7 meters long with an annual container throughput of 800,000 TEU.

Despite the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, it took the company just around three years to finish the first phase of construction on the new port, giving Israel a new gateway to the world.

The country is geographically isolated so the development of ports is crucial to its economic growth, said Izak Blumenthal, CEO of Israel Ports Company.

""With the advanced technology and rich experience provided by SIPG, we hope the new port will not only serve Israel's demands, but also become a regional logistics hub to serve gulf countries, or even the whole Middle East,"" he said.

The opening of the new port comes at a time when seaports around the world are struggling with shipping congestion.

A recent report by Swiss shipping company Kuehne+Nagel said more than 100 ports around the world are backed up, with some 350 ships waiting to dock and unload.

The delays have led to longer delivery times and higher prices. The hope is that with the improvements SIPG can bring to Haifa's operations, global shipping capacity and mobility will be enhanced.

Previously a great deal of cargo for the Mediterranean had to be unloaded in other ports. But Israel is a gateway to the eastern Mediterranean, a very important logistics hub, and is closely connected with the Shanghai Port.

Currently, a large proportion of cargo from Shanghai has to use surface transport to Europe, according to Fang. With the new port, shipping services will be strengthened and there will be better connections with Shanghai."

China has continued to play a major role in financing and supplying telecom and ICT equipment to Africa. /Screen Grab

China has continued to play a major role in financing and supplying telecom and ICT equipment to Africa. CGTN's Daniel Arap Moi submits that Chinese companies like Huawei have helped to bring down charges and contributed to the success of mobile phones on the continent.

Chinese telecom companies have in the past decade become key players in Africa's digital economy. Some of the telecom firms are now integrated into Africa's public and private sectors. The companies are providing digital infrastructure for projects like data centers, e-governance, telecom infrastructure, and undersea internet cables.

Huawei's hardware equipment reportedly constitutes 70 percent of the 4G infrastructure in Africa. The company is also the first to offer 5G services in Africa. The peace submarine cable in which Huawei is a major player is expected to offer the shortest submarine fiber cable route from China to Africa with its landing zones in Djibouti and Kenya.

Besides Huawei, Transsion Holdings group reportedly controls 40 percent of the smartphone market in Africa. In 2020, its smartphone market share in the continent exceeded 40 percent and ranked number one by the end of the second quarter. Its brands include Tecno, Itel, and Infinix.

China's tech companies have also developed apps like Boomplay and Vskit that dominate Africa's social media landscape. In the mobile money segment, apps like Palmpay and OPay are backed by Chinese investors to make inroads into the fintech sector.

South Africa's Vodacom Group in partnership with Alibaba launched Vodapay, a super-app that integrates mobile payments with e-commerce, business, and lifestyle services.

Chinese tech companies are also supplying various authorities with diverse digital infrastructure and services.

Tech companies like Huawei and ZTE have secured government contracts to construct smart cities, data centers, and Artificial Intelligence and technology systems."
"WTCA: Trade-war tariffs can only push high inflation, weigh on SMEs","Editor's note: Despite of decoupling rhetoric and exhausting high tariff, China-U.S. trade is booming in terms of data volume. Robin van Puyenbroeck, executive director-business development of the World Trade Centers Association (WTCA), said the number proved the economy relation between China and U.S. is so interconnected and intertwined, that tariffs can't change the dynamic of the trade, but only push high the inflation and harm the small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).

Instead of ""war,"" often used to describe China-U.S. trade these days, Puyenbroeck said he prefers to use ""rebalance,"" calling for China, the U.S. and Europe ¨C the three biggest trading blocs globally ¨C to work together to create a more inclusive global trade infrastructure.

Puyenbroeck said the political rhetoric of trade war has not affected China's position in the global supply chain, adding that the Chinese market is most likely to become the largest market in the world. Though China's labor cost is rising, China is still very competitive in productivity, sophisticated logistic infrastructure and high skilled workers ¨C all of these make China the key market for companies to be, he said.

The following excerpts from an interview with Puyenbroeck have been edited for clarity and brevity.

CGTN: Do you think the high tariff is between China and the U.S. sustainable? What's the impact on the real economy?

Puyenbroeck: The tariff there is not going to change the dynamic. You can not decouple and entangle the world's two largest trading blocs, especially after they have been integrated for such a long time and for decades. So I think the tariff is just counter-productive. The victims of the the hefty tariff and trade instability are SMEs.

Tariffs can't regulate how the economy works. In many countries, we see inflation is rising to very high numbers, and it's the consumer and worker who pay the bills of tariff.

CGTN: How do you look at China's position and role in the global supply chain?

Puyenbroeck: China is a very competitive place to be in productivity, labor force and supply chain. Chinese has a very sophisticated logistic infrastructure. All of the things come together that make China the key market for companies to be.

The foreign direct investment (FDI) for 2020 showed China broke a record of $163 billion FDI inflow, the largest in the world. It tells us that money is still flowing into China, and China is still producing more high-end goods here. Companies think in a long-term and very hard way of where to invest their dollars. Given Chinese would be the largest consumer market, it will have a place in any global supply chain.

Xi says China to establish stock exchange in Beijing,"China will set up a stock exchange in Beijing and build it into a major base for innovative small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), Chinese President Xi Jinping announced Thursday.

China will continue to support the innovation and development of SMEs and deepen reforms of the ""new third board,"" Xi said while addressing the Global Trade in Services Summit of the 2021 China International Fair for Trade in Services via video.

The ""new third board,"" officially known as the National Equities Exchange and Quotations (NEEQ), was launched in Beijing in 2013. It offers SMEs a financing channel with low costs and simple listing procedures.

This is a new major strategic deployment for the capital market to better serve the new development paradigm and promote high-quality development, China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) said after the announcement.

It points out the direction and provides compliance for the further deepening of the ""new three board"" reform and the improvement of the capital market's financial support system for SMEs, the CSRC added.

NEEQ Select-based Beijing Stock Exchange

In a separate statement, published on the CSRC official WeChat account, it said the Beijing Stock Exchange (BSE) will be built on the basis of the existing NEEQ Select.

Since 2019, the commission has rolled out a series of reform measures to the NEEQ, including establishing a ""Select"" scheme, the CSRC said. These measures have stimulated market vitality and achieved positive results, it added.

The operation of the NEEQ Select has been stable, with various system innovations attracting a group of high-quality SMEs to list for trading, which laid a foundation for further deepening reforms and establishing a stock exchange, the CSRC said.

Position of Beijing Stock Exchange

The BSE will firmly adhere to the market positioning of serving innovative SMEs, the CSRC said in the statement.

The BSE, Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges ¨C current two main onshore exchanges and regional equity markets will adhere to coordination and interconnection, the CSRC said.

Additionally, the BSE will insist on system linkage and coordination with the existing ""Innovative Layer"" and ""Basic Layer"" ¨C measures for the market tier-based administration of companies listed on the NEEQ ¨C to maintain a balanced market structure, the CSRC added.

By the end of 2020, a total of 8,187 companies were listed on the NEEQ ¨C among which SMEs accounted for 94 percent, with a combined capitalization of 2.65 trillion yuan ($410 billion), data from the NEEQ website revealed.

In 2020, the capital raised by companies listed on the board increased by 27.91 percent year on year, of which 10.56 billion yuan was raised from public offerings. The turnover of stock transactions reached 129.46 billion yuan, increasing the average daily turnover by 57.44 percent compared to the previous year, according to the NEEQ.

The NEEQ was set up as a supplement to the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges.

The Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE), established in 1990, is one of the top exchanges in the world. According to statistics of the World Federation of Exchanges, as of the end of 2020, the SSE ranked second, third and fourth respectively in capital raised, total market capitalization and total turnover.

The Shenzhen Stock Exchange, also established in 1990, is on the path to becoming an influential exchange. The exchange ranked third and fourth worldwide respectively in capital raised and total turnover, as of the end of 2020, the same source said."
CIFTIS Global Trade in Services Summit opens in Beijing,"The Global Trade in Services Summit of this year's China International Fair for Trade in Services (CIFTIS) began in Beijing on Thursday.

Scheduled from September 2 to 7 at the China National Convention Center and Shougang Park in Beijing, this year's event has attracted over 11,000 enterprises from 153 countries and regions, up 45 percent from last year.

Among the 2,400 firms that will showcase their products and services offline, up to 18 percent are Fortune 500 companies and leading enterprises, according to the organizers.

Held against the backdrop of the global pandemic and fragile economic recovery, the trade fair shows the great importance China places on the development of the service trade and resolute confidence to promote a high level of opening-up, said Chinese Vice Premier Hu Chunhua at the opening ceremony of the summit.

Chinese President Xi Jinping delivered a keynote speech via video at the ceremony.

Other speakers included Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, Uruguayan President Luis Lacalle Pou, Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa, Irish Prime Minister Micheal Martin, Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh and WTO Deputy Director-General Anabel Gonzalez.

Several Chinese firms, including Meituan, Pinduoduo and Tencent, have embraced the country's ""common prosperity"" drive in their earnings reports, as private firms align with the campaign to reduce wealth inequality in the country.

Food delivery giant Meituan, which has recently posted a third consecutive quarterly loss and is facing increased regulatory scrutiny, said in its statement that it will ""promote 'common prosperity' for the larger society.""

On Monday's earnings call, the company's founder Wang Xing translated Meituan's name as ""better together"" in Chinese and said ""common prosperity"" was ""built into the genes of Meituan.""

""The recent new regulatory environment change reminded us of our role in society and compels us to innovate and better contribute to society at large,"" said Wang. The company repeatedly mentioned the term ""regulation"" on its Monday's call.

On the same day, Meituan posted a quarterly loss of 2.21 billion yuan (about $342 million) in the April-June period.

Hours before the release of the quarterly results, China's market regulator announced that it had initiated an antitrust investigation into the company's acquisition of bike-sharing firm Mobike in April 2018.

In late July, Chinese authorities also required Meituan to offer social insurance covering accidents and sickness and pay no less than the local minimum wage to hard-pressed food deliverymen, appropriately relax delivery time limits, and ensure their safety on the road.

Labor issues at food delivery platforms including Meituan have come under scrutiny in recent months, as these platforms were reported to give deliverymen impossible routes through stringent algorithms to follow when fulfilling orders and penalizing them for late deliveries.

Meituan was required to establish a mechanism for conflict resolution with riders, where riders can explain the late delivery of orders due to objective factors within 24 hours.

Pinduoduo, a fast-growing e-commerce giant that challenges Alibaba in rural areas, also announced an initiative of 10 billion yuan ($1.5 billion) for farmers' welfare on its second-quarter earnings call.

Tech giant Tencent said last month it would double the amount of money allocated for social responsibility programs to about $15 billion, which gave full play to the role of enterprises in the ""third distribution.""

The third distribution was a call under the government's drive for ""common prosperity,"" and it refers to charity and donations.

The government is more likely to encourage companies to shoulder more social responsibility through moral suasion and tax incentives on donations, Wang Tao, chief China economist at UBS Investment Bank, wrote in an analysis.

""Common prosperity"" has become a key theme in China's policy documents and recent speeches by senior leaders. Its importance has increased in the 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-2025) and beyond.

The drive marks a turn from earlier years when the government encouraged ""some people, some region to get rich first."" It means a more equal society with better social welfare as the country becomes richer and more advanced.

The Nasdaq closed Wednesday at a record high, with the S&P 500 ending near its previous peak, as September kicked off with renewed buying of technology stocks and private payrolls data, which supported the case for dovish monetary policy.

Technology stocks, which tend to benefit from a low-rate environment, were up. Apple rose to its second record high this week, and Microsoft, Amazon and Google-owner Alphabet all advanced.

Sectors considered as bond-proxies or defensive including utilities and real estate were also among the top performers.

""Given there's going to be some choppiness in the economic recovery because of COVID, people will look for where they can find the best future growth potential,"" said Chris Graff, co-chief investment officer at RMB Capital.

Wall Street's main indexes have hit record highs recently, with the benchmark S&P 500 notching seven straight monthly gains as investors shrugged off risks around a rise in new coronavirus infections and hoped for the Fed to remain dovish in its policy stance.

Another set of data on Wednesday showed U.S. manufacturing activity unexpectedly picked up in August amid strong order growth, but a measure of factory employment dropped to a nine-month low, likely as workers remained scarce.

Surveys earlier in the day showed Asian and European factory activity lost momentum last month as the coronavirus pandemic disrupted supply chains."
Chinese regulators summon 11 ride-hailing firms over illegal operation,"Chinese regulators on Wednesday summoned DiDi Chuxing and 10 other ride-hailing firms to talk about recent ""illegal operation problems and actions disrupting the market order.""

The Ministry of Transport, the Cyberspace Administration of China and three other agencies said some companies have engaged in illegal activities involving a variety of marketing methods and ""vicious"" competition. Their actions have disrupted the market order, affected the safety and stability of the industry, and damaged the legitimate rights and interests of drivers and passengers, the regulators said.

China's ride-hailing giant DiDi Chuxing and Meituan's ride-hailing unit were previously summoned in May to rectify their pricing rules and order dispatching mechanisms.

They were joined by Caocao, Shouqi, Dida, Xiangdao, T3, Gaode, Ruqi, Yangguang and Wanshun in this latest regulatory directive.

The 11 should adhere to the bottom line of operating in compliance with laws and regulations, the regulators said, and must strictly implement the ""three licenses"" for platforms, vehicles and drivers.

The regulators will expedite the removal of existing non-compliant vehicles and drivers on the platform. They will require qualified drivers and vehicles to apply for permits for online ride-hailing as soon as possible."

U.S. manufacturing activity unexpectedly picked up in August amid strong order growth, but a measure of factory employment dropped to a nine-month low, likely as workers remained scarce.

The survey from the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) on Wednesday continued to highlight persistent problems securing enough raw materials, a situation worsened by disruptions caused by the latest wave of COVID-19 infections, primarily in Southeast Asia, as well as ports congestion in China.

""A surprising turn of events for manufacturing activity in the U.S., but it doesn't change the story of supply disruptions and shortages holding back stronger growth,"" said Jennifer Lee, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto.

The ISM said its index of national factory activity inched up to 59.9 last month from a reading of 59.5 in July. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in manufacturing, which accounts for 11.9 percent of the U.S. economy. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index falling to 58.6.

Manufacturing is holding up even as spending is rotating back to services from goods because of vaccinations against COVID-19. All of the six largest manufacturing industries, including computer and electronic products, chemical products and transportation equipment, reported moderate to strong growth.

Manufacturers of computer and electronic products said while a global semiconductor shortage was impacting supply lines, they had so far ""been able to manage it without impacting clients.""

Chemical goods producers said they continued to ""see extended lead times due to port delays and sea container tightness."" Transportation equipment makers reported that ""strong sales continue, but production is limited due to supply issues with chips.""

The ISM survey's forward-looking new orders sub-index rebounded to a reading of 66.7 last month after two straight monthly declines. Fourteen out of 18 manufacturing industries, furniture and related products, machinery and electrical equipment, appliances and components reported growth in new orders. Only nonmetallic mineral products reported a drop."

Morgan Stanley economist: New regulations to reset China's economy,"04:52

Recently, a raft of regulations issued by the Chinese government covering several sectors including technology, education and data privacy have sent Chinese stock shares tumbling. These new measures indicate ""a significant moment in the history of China's economy and capital market,"" said Robin Xing, Chief China Economist of Morgan Stanley. Behind the regulatory reset is China's new objectives in this era, that is to ""shift from 'growth first' to a more balanced approach between development and sustainability, Xing told CGTN. He believes Chinese policy makers are trying to ""steer a middle course between tapering the worst effect of market forces, while ensuring a reasonable and sustainable rate of economic growth.""

Besides the regulation shift, China is also promoting common prosperity. How to interpret this new policy also raised lots of discussions over its implication. Some critics doubt whether this means China would kill the rich to help the poor. Xing believes the purpose of this policy is to ease inequality and give all citizens fair share in creating wealth. The most pressing need for China today is to address income inequality and to raise the share of weights in GDP to support the long-standing goal of rebalancing the economy towards consumption, said Xing, adding that the guideline of common prosperity is ""just to address this issue,"" which would ""pave the way for a healthy and balanced economic growth for China."" The following are excerpts from the interview, which has been edited for clarity and brevity.

CGTN: What kind of signals do you think the government is sending out through the new regulations?

Xing: I think the signal is we are at a significant moment in the history of China's economy and capital market. What is behind the regulatory reset is China's new objectives in this new era: to balance growth and sustainability. That is an agenda addressing social equality, environmental sustainability, and data safety.

CGTN: What does the guideline of common prosperity mean to individuals and businesses? Xing: We believe that policy makers go of common prosperity focused on the challenges of rising income inequality. The most pressing need today is to address income inequality, and raise the share of weights in GDP to support the long-standing goal of rebalancing the economy towards consumption. So with the weight share of under 50 percent of GDP, and relatively high level of precautionary saving, given the limited access to health care, education and housing, especially for migrant workers, the proportion of private consumption in GDP, is naturally limited. And raising the share of household incomes in GDP and reducing inequality while tackling the three big mountains, like escalating healthcare, education and housing cost, should support a higher share of private consumption, so that's what the common prosperity is about, rebalancing the economy in favor of labor and in favor of consumption."

In a small room at the back of a supermarket selling products and specialties from Yizhou, a district under the administration of Hechi City, south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, the CGTN Digital team found the young and lively Huang Haixia talking to online audiences as she presented a local rice brand. The 33-year-old, who goes by the name of ""Sanjie"" on the video platform Douyin, is a professional livestreamer giving demonstrations of products sold in the supermarket with the aim of increasing the income of impoverished farmers in the region.

Authentic experience for targeted audiences When the CGTN team visited, Huang was wearing a traditional Liu Sanjie costume that is common on live transmissions as a way to put an extra spotlight on local characteristics. ""This is the internet era, so if we are promoting these products in Douyin and we are in the hometown of Liu Sanjie, singing and wearing these traditional costumes is a must, that's why I'm wearing this beautiful costume today. We must show Yizhou characteristics,"" she shared proudly. We caught her during the second half of her shift which starts in the morning with onsite shoots, followed by studio livestreams in the evening. ""Right now, we don't have fresh fruits, but if we had, we would go to the orchards to livestream from there. When people see it directly, they want to help the farmers, and this project is exactly for that, to help farmers sell their products,"" she explained.

""Because people go to work and school during the day, there may not be many people watching during daytime, so we broadcast in the evenings, after 5 or 6 p.m. If it is an indoor live, it will take about three or four hours. This is a fixed time, otherwise, we will lose viewers."" Huang said that each session features five or six products, with around half an hour dedicated to each. The feedback has been mostly positive. ""For sure, not all 100 percent praise, but it's mainly good.¡­"" she said. ""Some customers have been seeing us for a while, and they may say, 'you are always introducing the same thing;' that's not very good.""

Trade secrets There are a few essential ingredients for success in this trade. First, presenters need to have a comprehensive understanding of the products they sell. ""We need to have a real understanding of the product characteristics; if we don't, we need to go into the field to learn. Like silkworm breeding, it's very important for us, so we need to know about it."" The more they know, the more information they can give viewers, improving the quality of the experience. Second, favorable feedback from the clients themselves online and during live sessions can be very helpful in driving sales. ""For example, with beef jerky, someone said they bought it last time and it was good, and then someone says 'I'll buy it too,'"" Huang said. ""This is very common because these snacks come in small bags that are easy to share with others. If other people buy it, it will be easy to repurchase."" She admits there is a big difference between livestreams like hers and mainstream shopping channels on Chinese social media and e-commerce platforms.

Tired repetition of 'lab leak' theories is like flogging a dead horse,"Screenshot of the documentary ""What Really Happened in Wuhan"" on the website of Sky News Australia.

Screenshot of the documentary ""What Really Happened in Wuhan"" on the website of Sky News Australia.

Editor's note: CGTN's First Voice provides instant commentary on breaking stories. The daily column clarifies emerging issues and better defines the news agenda, offering a Chinese perspective on the latest global events.

Several weeks ago, the long-awaited 90-day ""Intelligence Review"" into the origins of the COVID-19 as commissioned by the Biden administration came to a completion. But, to nobody's surprise, the report was met with a whimper from the mainstream media because it failed to satisfy the narrative that the virus had ""leaked from a laboratory,"" as there was no serious evidence available to satisfy what has been at best a science-fiction conspiracy theory.

Case closed, right?

Not quite. Despite this, many outlets in the mainstream media have continued to project the false narrative based on sheer speculation that the origins of COVID-19 stem from an accident in the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV). One of these, pushed by Murdoch-owned Sky News Australia, included a documentary titled ""What Really Happened in Wuhan"" by Sharri Markson ¨C again an attempt to make a ""smoking gun"" with deeply flawed evidence that the laboratory leak is real.

The problems with this video are abundant. First, it attempts to cite evidence of a cover-up from the WIV stemming from September 2019. However, four U.S. intelligence agencies in Biden's own review contradict this claim by acknowledging that Chinese officials had ""no foreknowledge"" of the emerging COVID-19 pandemic.

The video proceeds to claim that Huang Yanling, who was claimed to be a researcher at the WIV, is the so-called patient zero based on earlier claims that workers at the institute were reportedly sick around November 2019. It then makes the false claim she is ""missing"" and has never been heard of since.

An article from Health Analytics Asia debunks this misleading information, noting that she was a former student working at the institute completing her master's degree in 2015. She now lives elsewhere and never contracted the virus. This is why her information ""disappeared"" from the website."

It's said that ""history repeats itself, first as tragedy, second as farce,"" but we are far from suggesting that we are facing the latter.

As UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres stated before the 76th session of the UN General Assembly, which began on September 21, the focus of this summit is the U.S.' ""cold war"" with China.

""We need to avoid at all cost a cold war that would be different from the past one, and probably more dangerous and more difficult to manage,"" Guterres told The Associated Press in an interview.

Interestingly, the same dilemma occupied the thoughts of the participants to ""the first intercontinental conference of colored peoples in the history of mankind,"" as former President of Indonesia Sukarno called the Bandung Conference, which took place on April 18-24, 1955.

The conference in Indonesia was a response from African and Asian countries to the San Francisco Conference in 1945, which excluded many of the newly independent colonial countries from participation, and by default playing any significant role in the management of international affairs. In this sense, Bandung was more representative of the Third World than the conference in the U.S., which gave birth to the UN Charter and was dominated by the West.

At that time, similarly to what we are experiencing today, tensions between two geopolitical ""colossuses"" ¨C the U.S. and Soviet Russia ¨C were the origin of the international instability.

Fear of nuclear war and return to the pre-independence state of affairs resulted in an incredible determination to achieve peace and cooperation among the Global Southern nations, which ultimately decided that the UN would be the best possible place to raise their voice.

These countries brought the truly ""universal"" nature of international law into Geneva, as it was at Bandung when the interplay between the discipline and imperialism was formally challenged. But most importantly, the conference questioned the Eurocentric interpretation of the global order.

When global imperialism practiced by the U.S. has replaced neocolonialism, it is our duty to rediscover what Indian historian Vijay Prashad called ""the Bandung Spirit"" and critically re-engage with notions of sovereignty, human rights, and the international economic order.

The version of sovereignty and international relations that we have in mind is the one that relies on the ""Five Principles of Coexistence,"" which include (1) mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, (2) non-aggression, (3) non-interference in internal affairs, (4) equality and mutual benefit, and (5) peaceful coexistence."
The Global North's great test,"Editor's note: Gordon Brown is a former prime minister of the United Kingdom, and United Nations Special Envoy for Global Education and Chair of the International Commission on Financing Global Education Opportunity. The article reflects the author's opinions, and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

With low-income countries in Africa and elsewhere still imploring rich countries to stop stockpiling millions of unused COVID-19 vaccines, there are still real doubts as to whether the United States and Europe will honor the promise made at this year's G7 summit to vaccinate the world by the end of 2022.

U.S. President Joe Biden's administration has said that the Global North can deliver enough doses for everyone by next September's United Nations General Assembly. But the gulf between the vaccine-rich and vaccine-poor has grown so vast that under two percent of adults in low-income countries are fully vaccinated, compared to over 50 percent of adults in most high-income countries. Worse, millions of doses in high-income countries are now being wasted because they are not being used in time.

For many months earlier this year, Western governments could at least say that there was not enough vaccine supply to meet global demand. But, we are now producing 1.5 billion vaccines every month. As I write this, around 300 million doses of vaccines are lying unused, hoarded in warehouses or on their way to fulfill delivery contracts that have been monopolized by Western countries. As a result, the World Health Organization's September 2021 goal of vaccinating at least 10 percent of the population in every low-income country ¨C the basic level needed to cover health workers and the elderly ¨C remains unrealized.

According to a major study by the research firm Airfinity, the number of unused doses will reach one billion by this December. To put that staggering figure into perspective, it is enough to meet our year-end goal of vaccinating 40 percent of the African population.

Making matters worse, Airfinity shows that if we do not act, 100 million unused vaccine doses will have passed their expiration dates by the end of this year. And if we cannot airlift surpluses to where they are needed on a schedule that preserves a two-month shelf life, this figure could rise to 241 million. Either way, that is near-criminal wastage.

Exaggeration comes easily to politicians. But it is no overstatement to say that unless more vaccines, diagnostics, and treatments are made available to the Global South, there could be at least one million more COVID-induced deaths over the next year.

We know that more than 100,000 lives have been saved in Britain, owing to the administration of fewer than 100 million vaccine doses. Allowing 200 million or more doses to be wasted is thus tantamount to condemning hundreds of thousands of unvaccinated people in low-income countries to unnecessary suffering or death."

Editor's note: Danny Haiphong is a journalist based in the United States and activist with the No Cold War international campaign. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN. The formation of AUKUS signals another attempt by the United States to mobilize its so-called allies to police the Pacific. Though neither the U.S., UK, nor Australia were willing to name China as the target of the alliance, it isn't the first time that the U.S. has disguised its hostile policy toward China in the rhetoric of multilateralism. The Quadrilateral Security Dialogue or ""Quad"" represented the first such attempt, but a lack of strategic coherency within this alliance has led the U.S. to shift its focus back to ""traditional"" allies in the West.

The U.S., UK, and Australia share a common history as nations relied upon colonialism and aggression as anchors for development. AUKUS allegedly creates a comprehensive technological and economic strategy but so far has only one concrete proposal: the development of a nuclear-powered submarine fleet for Australia. This fleet is said to be an important factor in the broader goal of making the Pacific ""safer."" Military and political analysts in the West have been more than willing to name China as the principal ""threat"" to the safety of the Pacific. U.S. commentators and columnists such as Thomas Friedman of the New York Times and Jake Tapper of CNN, for example, have repeated the evidence-free claims that China threatens the U.S. access to trade routes in the Pacific. However, CNN military analyst and former U.S. Colonel Cedric Leighton admitted on U.S. national television that China has not yet done anything to interfere with these coveted trade routes. AUKUS is thus based on a fabrication that reveals that the so-called pact is nothing more than an expression of the U.S.'s military strategy to police the Pacific. This strategy has already caused more harm than good. Divisions are sharpening among Western countries, with New Zealand rejecting the pact and France pulling its ambassadors from the U.S. and Australia. AUKUS has also brought opposition to uranium mining in Australia, inflaming domestic political tensions in that country. It is the U.S., however, that shares the bulk of responsibility for escalating tensions with China in a moment when its own domestic political situation is far from stable. More than 12 thousand Haitian refugees have migrated to Texas, where they face brutal treatment and deportation from federal authorities.

UN should reclaim its mandate to enforce peace,"Editor's note: Stephen Ndegwa is a Nairobi-based communication expert, lecturer-scholar at the United States International University-Africa, author and international affairs columnist. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

The General Debate of the 76th session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) is underway in New York. As the main agenda-setting organ of the UN, the deliberations and outcomes of this veritable global meeting elicit a lot of interest and curiosity alike.

With the world facing unprecedented and seemingly insurmountable challenges in recent years, which have peaked with the COVID-19 pandemic, the UN is the last hope to help us avoid reaching the tipping point. There seems to be no relenting in the downward spiral, with climate change gradually taking up the space left by the plateauing pandemic.

Among other issues, UNGA 2021 is expected to discuss the fight against COVID-19, inequality, justice and climate change. Now, the common denominator in all these and other issues that will be canvassed is global peace. The establishment today is unfair to countries and regions that do not serve the strategic interests of hegemonic entities and those without sufficient resources to mitigate the ripple effects of the negative actions of those with superpower status.

By coincidence, the UNGA is gathering at a time the world is marking the International Day of Peace, which is celebrated annually on September 21. This year's theme is ""Recovering better for an equitable and sustainable world.""

Peace is not necessarily the absence of war. By its definition, peace is an all-encompassing state of being that includes friendship and harmony, and freedom from fear of violence. The practice of these values by the international community would create a world with benefits for humanity, with every significant player considering win-win outcomes in every endeavor."
Does China want to make Beijing the epicenter of sustainable finance?,"Editor's note: Matteo Giovannini is a finance professional at the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China in Beijing and a member of the China Task Force at the Italian Ministry of Economic Development. The article reflects the author's views, and not necessarily those of CGTN.

For decades, the global financial industry has been driven by an approach based on short-term performance with an excessive focus on meeting profit targets in each quarter while forgetting the role of strategy and long-term value creation.

The so-called ""short-termism,"" guided by the goal of wealth maximization for the shareholder, has sadly demonstrated to be nearsighted and represent a major factor in undermining sustainable business models and deteriorating the trust built with customers, employees, and investors.

A shift in paradigm from shareholder value to stakeholder-focused model has seen China emerge in a leading position on a global scale due to its high level of responsiveness to environmental issues, demonstrating that the country is well-aware of the growing role that the green economy is going to play as a new engine of growth and development.

Therefore, it is not surprising to learn that the country, through a letter sent last week by Finance Minister Liu Kun to the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) Foundation, has formally made public its candidature to host in Beijing the headquarters of a new international corporate sustainability agency.

The new body, which is set to supervise corporate rules on climate change and environmental reporting endorsed by G20 finance ministers and central bankers during a recent meeting in Italy, is expected to announce its hosting place before the UN climate summit in Scotland in November.

In my view, China's decision to support its capital city in getting assigned the new agency clearly shows the level of confidence that the country has reached after the progressive implementation of an array of green technologies, including hydro, wind, and solar power, that have contributed to turning megacities such as Beijing into a greener, cleaner, and more inclusive place to live.

A recent report from the American consultancy firm Boston Consulting Group (BCG) on the world's best places to live certifies this trend showing that now Beijing leads in Asia and precedes most of the globally celebrated urban centers such as Zurich, Sydney, Singapore, and San Francisco.

From a diplomatic perspective, the move represents a strong signal of continuity with China's decision to join the Paris Agreement in 2016 and with the pledge, made by Chinese President Xi Jinping at the 75th session of the UN General Assembly, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to develop a green and sustainable economy during the next four decades.

The decision to become a global protagonist in the future of the green economy demonstrates that the country is more than willing to engage with the rest of the world and, when necessary, to pioneer in fields where it has a competitive advantage and an unrivaled expertise.

Technological innovation has always represented a key pillar in China's development story, and the current green transformation makes this aspect even more critical due to the fact that technology enables more efficient use of resources, promotes productivity improvements, and provides the solution to historical problems such as the high level of carbon emissions and pollution."
Mid-Autumn Festival: Separating so that others can unite,"Willingly, people give up certain freedoms in exchange for the health and safety of their family and community. Deep down in such conscience is the ethos of family unity and loyalty in the Chinese culture, an essential element in crisis resolution. In Chinese culture, family bonds and mutual help motivate people to work hard and empowers them to be stronger and better. The same mindset and sentiment bring people home for a reunion during the Mid-Autumn Festival, no matter how far from their family or homeland they are. Their longing for reunion is represented in a circle, a prominent yet simple symbol ¨C the moon. Likewise, the willingness to cooperate and sacrifice oneself, rather than just protecting one's interest, is helpful to the prosperity of one's home and community. This is why when the Delta variant emerged in Fujian Province, everyone, including children, observed the quarantine protocol.

Editor's note: Wang Yan is an associate research fellow at Beijing Foreign Studies University. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN. Mid-Autumn Festival is the most significant festival in China, as people get together with their family to moon gaze, eat moon cakes and enjoy shared joy under the light of the fullest moon of the year. Thanks to China's success in combating COVID-19, people can celebrate the festival in delight. China has the lowest number of cases in treatment and the highest recovery rate compared with many other countries. Behind such success are effective and strict screening, social distancing and quarantining protocols that the Chinese people have observed since the outbreak of the COVID-19. People of all ages have their health QR codes scanned and temperature checked wherever they go. If someone does not have their cell phone with them at the checkpoint, their home address, ID number and cell phone number will be collected for further tracking in case of necessity.

In Fujian Province, children as young as four years old walked into quarantine rooms on their own, wearing hazmat suits and carrying heavy suitcases. To them, they're observing the norm, just like everyone else. The people around the kids have set an example for them, making them aware that this is the right way to guarantee a safe living community.



Realistically, the conscience related to family unity and loyalty is realized through self-discipline that has been cultivated through education and fostered in the Chinese culture.



The cultivation of the ethical self is a principal objective of education as per Chinese culture, expressed as ""a man won't be well-educated until an ethical self is accomplished."" Chinese education emphasizes self-discipline, which is regarded as an integral part of character building and an essential foundation of grit that determines one's success.



In Chinese culture, there is an old saying, ""Xiushen qijia zhiguo pingtianxia."" It means a peaceful world is premised on a well-governed country or nation, which starts with cultivating the ethical self and having one's family organized. It is also the ideal that every intellectual pursues. All great aspiration starts with cultivating oneself in concert with others through diligence, discipline and collaboration.



While individualism teaches one to care about oneself first and care about others as much as one pleases, collectivism in Chinese families means that one should sacrifice oneself for the good of the entire family. Indeed, social order and well-being are built upon the moral conduct of individual members.



This will be a special Mid-Autumn Festival for the children and adults separated from their families. But in the end, they will all reunite with their family. As the Chinese saying goes, ""Despite being thousands of miles apart, we are still united under one moon.""

Despite the physical distance due to quarantine, familial bonds will still be strengthened. Years later, when the children grow up, they will recall, like many others, that they once walked into quarantine rooms with courage and love during the Mid-Autumn Festival, and they will dedicate themselves to building a prosperous nation and a beautiful world.

"20 years after 9/11, U.S. gets back to 'square one'","On September 11, 2001, a series of deadly terrorist attacks on U.S. soil petrified the world. To avenge the attacks, the U.S. started the War on Terror, invading Afghanistan to destroy al-Qaeda and the Taliban, who refused to hand over Osama Bin Laden. The U.S. soon toppled the Taliban government. Nevertheless, on the 20th anniversary of 9/11, the U.S. must face the fact that the Taliban have reclaimed Afghanistan while U.S. troops have hastily evacuated from the country.

It started as a war on terror. However, 20 years later, the number of terrorist groups within Afghanistan has risen. What the U.S. brought to Afghanistan is a complete humanitarian disaster: over 30,000 civilians were killed, more than 60,000 were injured and an estimated 11 million have become refugees as a result of U.S. military operations.

U.S. legacy of devastation in Afghanistan: Mission accomplished? /CGTN Cartoon U.S. legacy of devastation in Afghanistan: Mission accomplished? /CGTN Cartoon

The 20-year war fought under four presidents was riddled with contradictions in policy: In 2002, then President George Bush explicitly claimed that the U.S. would be partners in rebuilding Afghanistan; in 2021, President Joe Biden said, ""Our mission in Afghanistan was never supposed to have been nation building.""

A purpose lost or lost on purpose? /CGTN Cartoon A purpose lost or lost on purpose? /CGTN Cartoon

It's understandable that a war on terror is in the U.S. national interest. But it's confusing why the U.S. spent as long as 20 years and over $2 trillion on the democratic rebuilding of Afghanistan, only to end up evacuating in a rush. As a land never conquered by Great Britain or the Soviet Union during the 20th century, Afghanistan has once again proven its reputation as the ""Imperial Cemetery,"" this time to the U.S.

Besides Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria also suffered from U.S. attempts at a democratic transformation. In 2003, the Bush administration invaded Iraq on the pretext of the country possessing weapons of mass destruction. Since the Syria crisis in 2011, the U.S. government has never stopped instigating rebel forces against the Syrian government, and blatantly interfering in the country's internal affairs.

Veteran Correspondent on 9/11: America's Crusader Mentality Must Stop,"Editor's note: 20 years on, what's the biggest lesson of 9/11? British correspondent and scholar Martin Sieff pointed to U.S.' failed intervention in Afghanistan and the ""crusader mentality"" behind it. But he fears U.S. elites will soon enough replace Afghanistan with new crusades elsewhere.

Wang Guan: Martin, you are an Irish born and raised in Belfast. You are a foreign correspondent of 24 years working across Eastern Europe. And now, you're a historian commentator living in the United States. How do you look at the event that happened 20 years ago on September 11th? What are your thoughts on that?

Martin Sieff: With grief and anger and bewilderment, I felt it, first of all, that the Bush administration was initially culpable, because there were many warnings that the attack was coming. The documentation is very clear. They ignored the warnings. They were in the state of great incompetence and complacency. And thousands of innocent people died as a result. After the disaster, I think it was perfectly correct to, obviously, to go after the terrorists who were the perpetrators. But they used this as an excuse to bring in their own agenda to occupy Afghanistan permanently, which was utterly unnecessary.

Wang Guan: You mean the neo-cons, Rumsfeld, the Bushes, the Dick Cheneys?

Martin Sieff: Precisely. Yes, exactly. And if one had had a different Republican president or a Democratic president, this would not have happened. In fact, one needs to remember that it was never a priority for the Bush administration to hunt down and either kill Osama bin Laden or bring him to justice. The inter-agency task force to do this was disbanded under Bush. It was only when President Barack Obama took office that he revived an inter-agency task force, and they were highly successful, of course, in eventually hunting down and killing Osama bin Laden. But this was done by President Obama. It was not done by President Bush. For Bush and Rumsfeld and Cheney and their people the priority was always to use the atrocity of 9/11 as an excuse for expansionist policies in Central Asia and in the Middle East.

Wang Guan: How would you describe George Bush's interventionism? He was so set on invading Iraq and Afghanistan. Now, the U.S. troops are totally out of Afghanistan, and the Taliban is back in power.

Martin Sieff: You're absolutely right. By any standard ¨C rational, historical and political standards, the occupation of Afghanistan was a total failure. The United States tried to remake Afghanistan in its own image. They did so with complete ignorance of the nature of society and history and politics in Afghanistan. They ignored the tribal history. They ignored the traditional structures of cooperation between the different regions and tribes of Afghanistan. They imposed their own puppet leader, tried to impose a central government according to their own means. And hundreds of thousands of Afghans believed in the Americans and followed them. And those people have now fled the country or are in danger of their lives, because the Americans ultimately let them down. Because U.S.' permanent occupation of Afghanistan was a strategic absurdity, and an impossibility. India has never tried to occupy Afghanistan. China has never tried to occupy Afghanistan. When the Russians tried, when the Soviet Union tried, it failed disastrously for them. But they had the good sense to get out after only 7 years. The United States stayed there for 20 years. They spent at least $2 trillion, more than half of it certainly disappeared in corruption of both corrupt Afghans and Americans. And they destroyed the credibility of their own machine. They fed the credibility of the Taliban while trying to oppose it.

Wang Guan: What do you think Afghanistan will mean for U.S.' foreign policy going forward? Do you think Afghanistan will be the end or put a pause on U.S. interventionism? Because if we look at history, the U.S. foreign policy making has been acting like a pendulum, swinging between isolationism when its citizens are sick and tired of wars and, interventionism when the conservatives and some liberals think they need to impose their values and beliefs onto other societies.

Martin Sieff: I fully agree with you. I think the pendulum is still swinging. I would like to see a period of stability where the United States does not retreat into isolationism, and I think there are some hopeful signs that President Biden and Secretary of State Blinken recognize this. I do ¨C however much criticism is thrown at the U.S. for the way the final evacuation was made ¨C I think President Biden and Secretary Blinken at least had the courage, which previous presidents over two decades did not do, to recognize the disaster of being stuck in Afghanistan and to pull out. This is like medieval crusaders in Europe, seven, eight hundred years ago. Their main crusade was against the Muslim world in those days. But if they could not crusade against the Muslims, then they crusaded against Orthodox Slavic Christians in Eastern Europe, and they invaded them instead. They had to have someone to crusade against. There is a crusader mentality in Washington, and it is directed at China, and it is also directed at Russia. And it is very dangerous and very irresponsible. And that is the real underlying issue that needs to be addressed. And China can point this out, but China cannot control this. Only the United States, the American people and their political representatives in Washington can rein this in and change direction, but they need to do so. But I fear they will not do so. They will replace Afghanistan by hunting for new crusades around the world, and they should not do so.

9/11 was the start of another round of useless U.S. interventionism,"Editor's note: Today is the 20th anniversary of 9/11, which has been used as a pretext for the U.S. to invade Afghanistan. Two decades on, the impact of the 9/11 terror attacks on the United States and Afghanistan has been far-reaching.

Twenty years ago, on September 11, 2001, the world witnessed the deadliest terrorist attack on U.S. soil in history.

Al Qaeda coordinated four attacks using hijacked commercial airliners. Two iconic towers fell. The Pentagon sustained major damage. Nearly 3,000 people lost their lives. Countless more suffered immediate injuries and long-term health issues that are still being felt to this day.

The tragedies of 9/11 had been used as a pretext for the U.S. to invade Afghanistan.

Little did they know back then that they would be dragged into another nightmare of war for 20 years, leading to more than 210,000 deaths, including military personnel on both sides as well as Afghan civilians. It wasn't until August 30 that President Biden finally announced that the withdrawal from Afghanistan had been completed, and the war was over.

Things have certainly changed for Afghanistan, but for the worse. The truth is that the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan was only the beginning of 20 years of chaotic rule. The U.S. spent more than $2 trillion on this war. Where did all the money go? What did it bring to the people of Afghanistan? Let's take a look at a few items on the list.

A corrupted government

Back then, the U.S-backed Afghan government had two major obstacles: tribes and warlords, and their solution was BRIBERY. Gary Schroen, a former CIA agent who worked in Afghanistan, wrote in his book ""First In"" that large cash payments were sent to warlords in exchange for their support. With a system based on this political culture and norm, officials spent most of their time fattening their own wallets.

According to CBS News, at least 40 percent of soldiers in the Afghan Helmand province didn't actually exist, called ""ghost soldiers."" The Washington Post also reported that there were 350,000 registered soldiers and police in the Afghan security forces, but only 250,000 could be identified.

The U.S. Special Inspector General for Afghan Reconstruction, also known as SIGAR, reported more than $300 million a year was spent on salaries to these non-existent personnel, and ""the United States contributed to the growth of corruption by injecting tens of billions of dollars into the Afghan economy, using flawed oversight and contracting practices, and partnering with malign powerbrokers.""

Frank Vogl, author of ""Waging War on Corruption"", called the Afghan government ""a cesspool of corruption"" in which tens of billions of U.S. taxpayer's money had been looted.

A depressed economy

With all the powerful figures laughing all the way to the bank, did the Afghan people enjoy any economic improvement?

Sadly, no. After 20 years, Afghanistan is still one of the poorest countries in the world. Its GDP per capita is $586, the unemployment rate over 40 percent, and the poverty rate, over 70 percent.

The Afghan economy has not made much progress over the past 20 years under a U.S.-controlled government, and agriculture is largely abandoned, with one-third of its food imported.

But these didn't stop American contractors from making money. According to SIGAR, the Pentagon awarded a contract to build a natural-gas fueling station which cost over $42 million. In Pakistan, to build a similar gas station only costs half a million dollars. In 2013, the U.S. spent $6 million to buy nine Italian goats and transport them to Afghanistan, supposedly to improve the cashmere industry. But the goats got sick and died.

During this time, the Afghan economy became heavily dependent on the drug industry. During the Soviet-Afghanistan War, the CIA funded many resistance groups by teaching them poppy cultivation, which was banned by the Taliban in 2000. But after the U.S. invasion, the drug ban was no longer in force. The U.S. spent more than $8.6 billion on its war on drugs, but the sad truth is that opium production in Afghanistan has increased 40-fold over the past 20 years. Afghans produced 6,300 tonnes of drugs in 2020, about 85 percent of the world's supply.

An unstable society

Death is no stranger to Afghan people. At least 100,000 Afghan civilians have been killed or injured in the conflict between the U.S.-led coalition and Afghans resisting U.S. occupation of their country. This number should be considered an underestimate, as many Afghan casualties were buried quickly following Islamic customs, and records were not kept.

Although the U.S. deployed more than 800,000 soldiers to Afghanistan, the number of terrorist groups surged from three to more than 20 in the last 20 years.

The average life expectancy in Afghanistan today is a mere 45 years. Nearly half the people are totally dependent on foreign aid. Only 1 in 10 Afghan children finish high school. Only 35 percent of people have access to electricity and 70 percent of the power is imported. Think about it. The U.S. spent $2.26 trillion on the war. That's more than the worth of the top 30 richest Americans combined.

Let's do the math: Afghanistan's population is about 40 million. If the U.S. had given this money to all Afghans, then everyone would have received around $50,000.

U.S. President Joe Biden stated that the U.S. ""mission in Afghanistan was never supposed to have been nation-building,"" and he is considering further sanctions to cripple the lives of Afghan people.

Afghanistan was not the only place messed up by the U.S. in the last 20 years. The Arab Spring and subsequent wars, the rise of ISIS, and the Syrian refugee crisis all proved nothing but the uselessness of U.S. interventionism. With all this money spent, and all the lives lost, I can't help but wonder: 20 years after the 9/11 attacks, do Americans feel any safer?

UNHCR: We count on China and others for Afghanistan's humanitarian aid,"UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the UN refugee agency, warns that a major humanitarian crisis is looming in Afghanistan with vulnerable Afghans seeking shelter across the country's borders.

According to UNHCR, there is a displacement crisis in Afghanistan, of which the number of victims is more than 600,000 with 80 percent being women and children.

UNHCR is currently offering help together with other agencies like the World Food Program, the United Nations Children's Fund, and the World Health Organization through Afghanistan's neighboring countries such as Pakistan to send aid workers and products.

The Taliban has already put into place an interim government and established a ministry of refugees. Traditionally, this Taliban government branch was responsible for the country's refugee matters. But currently, it is at the local level with whoever is in charge of a particular area that UNHCR is doing the job.

""This is not about the recognition of the government. Humanitarian work is not a political issue,"" said head of UNHCR Filippo Grandi during an interview with CGTN host Tian Wei.

That in a way can pose other challenges to humanitarian efforts: the Taliban's chain of command over the past 20 years was not very clear, which meant demands coming from the central level may not necessarily be carried out immediately at the local level.

For Grandi, though, this is quite typical in a country that is in a transitional period of political uncertainties. ""We work in fragile situation for many years. The old chains of command break down, we don't know if they still exist, and the new ones are not yet there. It is complex,"" said Grandi, ""We need to be very pragmatic and opportunistic. When we have an opportunity, we go and bring help to people. And we're doing that in Afghanistan.""

Therefore, Grandi called on international community for cooperated help, saying ""we must interact with whoever controls a town, a province, an area"" to access people in need. So far UN has announced a major fundraising conference to take place in Geneva, Switzerland on September 13 to address this crisis.

""We count on China and on all other influential countries to help us,"" said Grandi. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Wednesday announced that China is offering at least $31 million worth of emergency aid to Afghanistan during his meeting with foreign ministers of Afghanistan's neighboring countries, including Pakistan, Iran, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan. Specifically, the aid supplies from China will include grain, winter supplies, medicines as well as three million COVID-19 vaccine doses.

UNHCR is calling on more countries in the world not to turn away their attention from Afghanistan, so as to avoid this from becoming ""a humanitarian catastrophe.""

The UK education is shifting: Implications for your education plans,"Editor's note: This letter is from Michael A. Mehari, who is the head of communications at BeGo Education, the education brand of LC Venture. The letter reflects the author's opinions, and not necessarily those of CGTN.

UK education has been arguably one the most influential system of education in the world for centuries, with the iconic universities of Oxford and Cambridge going as far as the 10th century. These two universities have been educating the elites of not just the UK but of the world. The UK is also home to some of the most prestigious UK boarding schools, with some going as far back as half a millennia. Together, they are responsible for 45 of the 55 UK's prime ministers, including the one currently in Office.

British education has also not remained confined to its shores but has been an international commodity. According to ISC Research, it is currently being taught at 12, 119 international schools across the world, with a total enrollment of 5.58 million students globally. Report show there were 485, 645 international students studying in the UK in 2018/19, with 24, 674 of them studying at British independent schools. Britain's top universities, as well as boarding and day schools, have also been the best models for educational excellence, adopted by many around the world.

However, the face of UK education is fast changing. The UK is having stiff competition form of the U.S., which has knocked it off from the top spot, attracting twice as many students from the rest of the world. But perhaps the most potent forces of change are coming from within the UK. There is an ongoing debate that the UK boarding schools and Oxbridge are caught in a never-ending cycle where they cannot escape each other and this is being fiercely challenged.

Organisations like Sutton Trust are leading the challenge. According to their report, the eight top schools had as many Oxbridge acceptances as another 2894 schools and colleges across the UK put together. The argument is that although only 7 percent of the UK population attend independent schools and roughly 1 percent graduate from Oxford and Cambridge, these elite are holding the lion's share of the government, business, media¡­etc. and decision-making power in the UK. They see this trend as worrying and many are demanding change.

These changes are nowhere felt than in the recent admission results to top universities, including Oxbridge. Leading UK universities are now more open to admitting students from a wider pool of students, including international applicants. They advertise contextual admission on their websites, and applications from less-advantaged regions and segments of the UK are now reaching admissions desks easily. The latest numbers with the state school Brampton Manor Academy getting more offers from Oxbridge than Eton School indicates that the top universities are paying attention."
Letters to the Editor: How to fix a teacher crisis we are heading for,"Editor's note: This letter is from Leon Hady who is a former headteacher, and founder of Guide Education, which has trained thousands of teachers.

A quarter of teachers in the U.S. are considering quitting their jobs, after the difficulties of teaching through a pandemic. There are no similar figures available in the UK, but I know anecdotally many teachers feel the same - in addition to the ongoing teacher shortage.

We need to widen access to the teaching profession for non-graduates, career changers and people with the passion and skills (if not the qualifications) that make someone a great teacher. This would be particularly welcomed post-furlough when, from October 1, we can expect a spike in unemployment.

The new 'open access' teacher training should also be free. The Postgraduate Certificate in Education's (PGCE) cost of over ?9,000 (post a ?27,000 degree) puts so many people off - especially when teachers don't earn as much as many other professionals. We can't afford to ignore the learning opportunity chasm left by the pandemic. We also can't afford for it to get worse, as teachers leave the profession exhausted by remote teaching.

The current system is leaving us in a deficit. As many as one in six teachers quit in the first year, and that's after a third drop out of PGCE courses and more than 36,000 teachers leave the profession each year. Only 50 percent of Maths and Physics teachers remain in their posts after five years. We need new routes to qualification, and new talent filling those vacant posts.

The problem is bad now, but it will get worse, as the number of secondary school students is set to rise by 15 percent by 2027. On the current trajectory, class sizes will rise and children will suffer. The removal of teacher training colleges in the 1970s did away with a third of teacher training placement opportunities and the sky high cost of becoming teacher has done the same over the last decade.

We need to be honest about whether training to be a teacher is a smart investment for potential candidates. It can take only one more year to qualify as a Doctor than it does to become a teacher. Doctors seek to earn up to ?88,000 per year after they specialize. A teacher can expect a fixed salary of around ?36,000.

With the government's coffers so depleted after the pandemic, and public borrowing consistently high over the last decade (in spite of austerity), doubling salaries is not a feasible option. The alternative is to cast our net wider, including to non-graduates and make those courses free.

Many parents will ask, ""how can you teach a subject without a degree in the first""? Well, many teachers already do. Only half of Key Stage 4 Maths hours are taught by teachers with degrees in that subject, falling to only 37 percent in the most disadvantaged schools.

As a former headteacher myself, I know that the key qualities a teacher needs to have are patience, passion, communication skills and empathy. For most subjects, teachers simply don't need a degree level of education to be teaching these subjects. Subject Knowledge Enhancement Courses (crash courses in a subject ensuring that a teacher knows enough to teach) are often used.

Informally, in-school, if we have a need and a teacher has a good A-level in a subject, we ask them to teach that subject. Do we need to set the bar there in order to alleviate the teacher training issues we face? With a longer training period, as the new teaching apprenticeship outlines?

In the 1970s and 80s there was a drive to professionalize teaching with more qualifications, through universities after the teacher training colleges were disbanded and many were absorbed by universities. We ended up with several PGCE variants, which have served us well, and of course have been revised over time to improve, but its cost will always be a hindrance to some.

Rather than lowering the quality of applicants, I believe a free non-graduate route into teaching would increase it - hugely. This is because the pool of talent would be widened, meaning that those with the best natural aptitude and passion for teaching could also apply, and not just those who could afford either a degree, a PGCE, or both.

I regularly meet hospitality workers, retail workers, actors and musicians where I think ""they would be a great teacher"". A lot of them will be out of a job when furlough ends in several weeks' time. I want it to be as easy as possible for them to make that career change.

We don't remember our really great teachers because of where they went to university. We shouldn't recruit them based on that either.

Letters to the Editor: The America I knew was better than this,"Editor's note: This is a letter from Yu Mengjie, a graduate from Clark University with a master's degree in communication, sharing her thoughts about the Capitol riot. There is an old Chinese saying, ""Even an upright official finds it hard to settle a family quarrel."" And I always learned from our media that it is reckless behavior to butt in other countries' internal affairs. However, with the U.S. run-off election turned into a riot and Trump supporters storming the U.S. Capitol, it is hard for anyone in the world with internet connection to turn a blind eye.

I spent two years living there, from 2013 to 2015, while I finished my master's degree and learned to drive for the first time. It was not a long period, but many memories flash in front of me now and then. Therefore, after an inner struggle, I decided to write down my feeling about the chaos. Some of my views might be personal since I am not a professional journalist, so thank you for your tolerance. Although from the previous reports, I expected some unrest along with the U.S. election process. I was still astonished to see a picture suggesting that the House of Representatives Speaker Podium had wound up on eBay. It was most likely an internet prank, yet it aptly described the chaos that the U.S. is facing. It's a joke that is hard to laugh at since the U.S. is still ranked at the top of the world economy, and it is also a country with a strong military force and nuclear weapons. Once such a country falls into turmoil, its impact on the world will be immeasurable. What is even weirder is that Trump put his people's lives in peril because he is unhappy with the election results. Five people died in the Capitol riot so far. Another thing in this chaos that leaves a deep impression on me is Facebook and Twitter's immediate response to Trump's unchained posts inciting violence. Twitter has blocked Trump's account permanently, and Facebook blocked him from posting indefinitely. People nowadays are living in a social media era. It changes the way we communicate. Information spreads faster, but it also brings some unexpected risks. Early in 1895, French social psychologist Gustave Le Bon defined the characteristics of crowds as ""impulsiveness, irritability, incapacity to reason, the absence of judgment of the critical spirit, the exaggeration of sentiments, and others. "" His theory may sound arrogant, but it seems like those characteristics are magnified on social media when people can hide their identity behind the screens. In August 2019, political theorist at Harvard University Danielle Allen had already foreseen that, yes, ""speech on a social media site, or a presidential platform, can eventually incites violence"" and advocated that the rules of incitement should apply to social media.

Changes in China,"Editor's note: This is a letter from Graham Smith, a writer, teacher, and long-term China resident, who shares his views on the changes that have taken place in a Chinese city where he first moved to more than a decade ago.

I recently moved back to China, having spent six years back in the UK. Having lived in a medium-sized third-tier city in Jiangsu Province and then Tianjin and then Beijing the first time around, I've come full circle and returned to the city in Jiangsu I initially moved to in 2007. (I'll keep it unnamed, if that's alright). I hadn't visited it in nine years, so the changes both to the city itself and life in general seem phenomenal.

It's a much-repeated truism that China is developing rapidly, but sometimes it's useful to step back and delineate exactly what has gone and what is new.

The city I found in 2007 had about two million people in the urban areas. I chose it because I was offered a job teaching at a university, which provided an apartment and meals on campus, while the students would also have a decent standard of English, which I thought would make things easier for a newcomer. (I had never previously been further east than Budapest, so felt an understandable degree of trepidation).

It was a great introduction to China, far from the Western imports of Shanghai and Beijing. There were maybe 10 foreigners in the entire city, so there wasn't an expat bubble. But because few students had ever seen a foreigner before, they constantly remarked ""Laowai!"" or ""Hullo!"" when I passed by. It might have been understandable that they would comment on such a novelty, but it grew very tiresome. The university's old campus was just outside the city center, and between them were two streets filled with numerous tiny mom and pop shops and restaurants, selling some of the best noodles I've ever had in my life (you could literally watch the cook slice them off with a razor) at very reasonable prices.

There weren't much leisure facilities: there was a pool and snooker hall with spittoons on the floor, KTV bars, bath houses and a dreadful smoky nightclub, the memory of those toilets even now fills me with horror; but that was about it. Shopping for Western items was difficult: for items like decaffeinated coffee, oregano, or pasta I had to take a five-hour bus to Shanghai and then hunt out the foreign food store in some upmarket hotel. The local supermarket astonished me with its tanks with live eels, turtles and frogs, and customer service was an idea just taking hold. (I remember one hot day asking for ice with a drink, and the consternation and confusion of the waiting staff). When buying any larger item you had to see one salesperson, who would write out a receipt, and then another, where you would actually pay money. It felt like you bought things at the convenience of the shop.

But now? Now it's very different. The city center has been massively redeveloped, knocking down the little shops and restaurants for giant plazas and shopping malls. A tram glides back and forth in the street in front of the university gate.

Shopping is a totally different experience. E-commerce is everywhere. Previously I had never used Alipay or WeChat, but this time I have yet to use cash for anything. Meituan delivery riders in their yellow jackets are highly visible, and make ordering food incredibly easy. Taobao similarly makes buying household items a frictionless task. Young people now have the money to be fashionable, with girls in Japanese Loli outfits and boys in upmarket denim and sneakers. The new shopping malls reflect the priorities of the population: in one of the largest, with eight stories, floors two and three are dedicated to educational and extra-curricular activities for children.

Taxis, once so cheap and plentiful, can't be easily flagged down any more ¨C it's all about ordering them through Didi. (In Beijing where I would sometimes spend half an hour trying to flag one down, this must be an absolute godsend). The roads are perhaps even busier, but the driving seems significantly better. Car horns, which once peep-peeped like bats trying to blindly navigate, now honk less vociferously.

Smoking seems also to have substantially declined. In 2014, according to the medical journal The Lancet, two thirds of Chinese men smoked, and there were few genuine restrictions on doing so indoors. But according to the 2018 China Adult Tobacco Survey, smoking among Chinese aged 25-44 and 45-64 has decreased significantly. It feels like a genuine sea change.

Meanwhile, the tower blocks throng all through the city, not just in the center. I don't recall seeing any before, but now there must be hundreds of 30-story tower blocks. There are several massive shiny new office blocks too. And the pace of life seems significantly quicker.

This isn't the sleepy backwater of 13 years ago. This is now a city bubbling with life, in the way that China does so excitingly.

And no one has called me laowai.

Vaccine producers must step up,"Editor's note: Jeffrey D. Sachs is the Director of the Center for Sustainable Development at Columbia University and President of the UN Sustainable Development Solutions Network. The article reflects the author's opinions, and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

The world stands at a critical juncture of the COVID-19 pandemic. Countries that lack the first round of vaccine coverage are extraordinarily vulnerable to the highly infectious Delta variant, and are also seedbeds for new variants that could quickly spread worldwide. The Lancet COVID-19 Commission, which I chair, is working urgently with the United Nations system to strengthen the multilateral response. Governments of countries where vaccines are being produced ¨C the United States, European Union members, the United Kingdom, India, Russia, and China ¨C need to cooperate under UN leadership to ensure that a sufficient supply of vaccine doses reaches the poorest countries.

The high-income countries now have more than 50 percent of their population fully vaccinated. Yet the fully vaccinated population in Africa remains under 4 percent. This lack of vaccine coverage in Africa, and in low-income countries elsewhere, poses an imminent danger to these populations.

U.S. President Joe Biden has called for a vaccine summit on September 22. This is potentially a highly significant step forward. It is important that the U.S. should hold this meeting in cooperation with China, India, Russia, and the other vaccine-producing countries, and with the UN system. Only the UN, with its universal membership and its operational capacity in low-income countries, has the ability to coordinate the rapid global scale-up of vaccine coverage.

In April 2020, the UN created the COVID-19 Vaccine Global Access (COVAX) facility to provide vaccines to lower-income countries. These countries expected COVAX to provide timely deliveries. Yet COVAX has been unable to buy a sufficient volume of vaccine doses mainly because high-income countries have repeatedly cut to the front of the queue. Moreover, the vaccine-producing countries' governments have imposed export quotas so that COVAX is often unable to secure even the vaccines for which it has contracts. The company shareholders are of course happy with these arrangements, because the rich countries pay more for the doses than COVAX would.

The supply crisis facing low-income countries in Africa and elsewhere will not resolve itself. On the contrary, high-income countries are now beginning to offer a third dose, even before highly vulnerable groups in the poorest countries (the elderly, health workers, the immunocompromised, and others) have received their primary vaccination.

Global opportunities for scaling up vaccine production are also being hampered by some governments' continued insistence on enforcing the patents on key vaccine technologies, even though these patents are held by academic institutions that were funded by the governments (notably by the U.S. National Institutes of Health). Likewise, public money funded the clinical trials and rollout of the vaccines. Despite the global urgency of the pandemic, life-saving public goods have been privatized."
The corporate capture of UN food summit,"Editor's note: Sofia Monsalve, secretary-general of FIAN International, is a member of the International Panel of Experts on Sustainable Food Systems. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

When I visited my parents in Bogota last month, I witnessed how people in their neighborhood went up and down the streets begging for help to survive. Since the end of April, Colombia has experienced one of its biggest waves of social unrest in recent times ¨C and hunger is at the core of the protests. South Africa experienced similar turmoil in July.

Growing hunger is creating volatility in many countries, compounding the devastating social and economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the climate crisis. According to recent United Nations figures, the pandemic has increased the number of hungry people by as many as 161 million, to 811 million. Nearly one in three people ¨C almost 2.4 billion ¨C lack access to adequate nutrition.

Given the lack of progress toward ending global hunger and malnutrition by 2030, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres will convene a Food Systems Summit in New York on September 23. The meeting has been billed as an opportunity to discuss bold new measures that will transform the way the world produces, consumes and thinks about food.

But the summit has been marred by controversy from the outset, largely owing to the influence of corporate interests in framing the agenda in what critics have described as an attempt to privatize decision-making. The UN set the pre-summit agenda in partnership with the World Economic Forum, placing key corporate players in leading roles. For example, the Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN), a Swiss-based foundation, leads the summit's work on eradicating hunger. One of GAIN's donors is the pesticide producer BASF, which seeks to portray itself as a ""Food Systems Hero.""

UN human rights experts have been damning in their criticism of the process, which has sidelined the UN's Committee on World Food Security (CFS). Discussions at the CFS include hundreds of representatives of smallholder farmers, fisherfolk, indigenous people and civil-society groups. Michael Fakhri, the UN special rapporteur on the right to food, has echoed the complaints of grassroots farming groups ¨C more than 500 of which are boycotting the summit ¨C likening corporations' excessive influence over the gathering to ""inviting the fox right into the henhouse.""

Smallholder farmers, peasants, fisherfolk, pastoralists and indigenous people feed most of the world's population with little or no access to corporate supply chains. About 80 percent of farms are smaller than two hectares, and cover about 12 percent of the world's farmland, while the largest one percent of agribusiness farms control more than 70 percent of farmland."
The Day of Peace won't change the U.S. instinct for meddling and war,"Editor's note: CGTN's First Voice provides instant commentary on breaking stories. The daily column clarifies emerging issues and better defines the news agenda, offering a Chinese perspective on the latest global events.

September 21 marks the International Day of Peace, but if you come from the United States, you may never have heard of it.

And for good reason. None of the nearly 80 million Americans born after 2001 have known a day of peace in their lifetimes. For them, drone assassinations, missile strikes and the background noise of perpetual war is all they have ever known. Although the U.S. is home to the United Nations headquarters, multilateralism and the pursuit of peace are not its favored tools for diplomacy. The U.S. has long preferred the threat and unilateral use of force.

In fact, the U.S. has only known peace for 17 years since it was founded in 1776.

In 2020 alone, it spent $778 billion on its military, triple the expenditure of China and accounting for 39 percent of global military spending. This money paid for the most advanced military in the world, with bases in around 70 countries. If you are a hammer, everything looks like a nail. With such a huge amount of money going toward military spending, the U.S. looks at all problems through a military lens.

For historical reasons, the U.S. likes to consider itself an exceptional nation, set apart from others by destiny or providence. Americans see themselves as a beacon of hope for the world to look up to, a shining city on a hill. Americans deeply feel that other nations all desire to be like the United States.

This is why former U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney was able to say on television in 2003 that U.S. troops would ""be greeted as liberators"" after they invaded Iraq ¨C even though this had no basis in fact. The Americans, to their shock surprise, were greeted with improvised explosive devices."
Trudeau's Gamble,"Editor's note: Freddie Reidy is a freelance writer based in London. He studied history and art history at the University of Kent, Canterbury, specializing in Russian history and international politics. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

Polls opened in Canada on September 20 are expected to be a major test for incumbent Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. When the snap election was called, Trudeau was riding high in the polls, but what led the prime minister to roll the electoral dice, and why have the odds narrowed over the course of the campaign?

Trudeau reasoned that his decision to hold a snap election was to give Canadians the opportunity to shape their own post-COVID-19 future. The Liberal leader said, ""In this pivotal, consequential moment, who wouldn't want a say? Who wouldn't want a chance to decide where our country goes from here?""

To those in Trudeau's inner circle, it might have seemed an ideal opportunity to capitalize on the positive voter sentiment toward the government's handling of the pandemic. The polls looked promising for Trudeau, and it was a chance to regain the majority the party lost in parliament in 2019. Furthermore, Trudeau's main rival, Conservative leader Erin O'Toole had been in the job for only a year and was little known.

Though what O'Toole lacks in experience, he makes up for in strategy. Aware of his low profile, the Conservative leader successfully articulated the national sentiment by attacking the very premise of the election as the nation entered a fourth coronavirus wave, saying, ""Now's not the time for an election. We can wait and go to the polls when it's safe,"" according to BBC.

Beyond the electoral rationale, another structural flaw was exposed. Even critics would concede that Prime Minister Trudeau's carefully managed personal image is the center of his party's ideological fortunes. The incumbent, therefore, not only staked his personal political future on a snap election but also that of his brand of liberalism ¨C a brand that has been under greater scrutiny than ever before during the campaign. He has drawn criticism over the years from certain quarters, accusing him of being a popinjay for famously sporting garish socks, cultivating a fashionable beard and frequently appearing without a tie in a bid to appear more relatable. Other gimmicks famously include directing a female journalist to use the term ""peoplekind"" rather than ""mankind"" during a town hall meeting press conference.

However, during the campaign, Canada's first black party leader Annamie Paul of the Green Party, stated in a televised debate that she did ""not believe that Mr Trudeau is a real feminist"" because ""a feminist doesn't continue to push strong women out of his party when they are just seeking to serve."""

Editor's note: Bobby Naderi is a London-based journalist, guest contributor in print, radio and television, and documentary filmmaker. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

The United States, the United Kingdom and Australia have come up with ""a new enhanced trilateral security partnership"" that allegedly seeks strategic engagement with China in the Asia-Pacific region.

Censured by China as a ""geopolitical gaming tool"" that makes no sense for Australia or the Asia-Pacific at all, the nuke sub deal, dubbed AUKUS, is allegedly designed to curb China from a ""position of strength,"" which is demonstrably wishful thinking. It will see Australia, the U.S. and the UK share advanced technologies with one another.

Under the plan, Australia may conduct routine patrols through areas of the South China Sea and near China's Taiwan region. It's the clearest signal yet that, following the debacle in Afghanistan, the Biden administration is anxious to pivot U.S. foreign policy around competition with China and help its losing commanders save face.

Perhaps important is the message that's been sent to the international community through this misbegotten venture of the first order. The provocative move may weaken the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), with significant implications for an unnecessary arms race in the Asia-Pacific. It is essentially guaranteed that the region would remain unstable and imbalanced ¨C not necessarily in AUKUS's favor though.

It should be noted that not many people in Australia are in favor of a nuclear arms race, or a new Cold War in the Asia-Pacific. AUKUS means more U.S. weaponry and more boots on Australian ground. The public view is that the submarine announcement may not be right for Australia. Nuclear energy has no economic or political merits, nor would it be a timely response to climate change.

Into the argument, Australia would need to safely store and dispose of radioactive waste. This appears unlikely, given the public opposition to establishing a site to dispose of nuclear waste. Let's face it: There is little community support for nuclear power in Australia, especially following the Fukushima disaster."
AUKUS is the latest form of U.S. imperialist aggression against China,"Editor's note: Andrew Korybko is a Moscow-based American political analyst. The article reflects the author's views and not necessarily those of CGTN.

The unveiling last week of new Australia-UK-U.S. (AUKUS) trilateral military alliance prompted intense criticism across the world, including from those countries' French ally which just lost out on a AU$90-billion submarine deal with Canberra to London and Washington.

Many observers rightly remarked that AUKUS is aggressively meant to provoke China in the Asia-Pacific. They also drew attention to it showing just how unreliable the U.S. is as an ally that it would backstab France by negotiating this alliance in secret without its knowledge and then stealing what that country's media previously referred to as the ""Contract of the Century.""

There's another analytical layer to all of this as well though and it's that AUKUS confirms that the U.S. is practicing an imperialist policy. This isn't just rhetoric either but an objective reflection of the facts based on Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne's surprisingly candid revelation. According to the U.S. State Department's transcript of the press conference that she participated in alongside her American counterpart and their defense ministers, she said that the contemporary state of their alliance ""is well suited to cooperate on countering economic coercion.""

This very strongly implies that AUKUS is a military response to economic competition from China. One of Russian communist revolutionary Vladimir Lenin's most famous works, ""Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism,"" theorizes that imperialist states employ military means in order to advance self-interested economic ends.

Aggressive posturing with nuclear facet weakens nonproliferation govt,"The U.S. Navy conducted a scheduled, two-missile test flight of unarmed life-extended Trident II (D5LE) missiles from USS Wyoming (SSBN-742), an Ohio-class ballistic missile submarine, on the Eastern Test Range off the coast of Cape Canaveral, Florida, September 17, 2021. /Screenshot via navy.mil The U.S. Navy conducted a scheduled, two-missile test flight of unarmed life-extended Trident II (D5LE) missiles from USS Wyoming (SSBN-742), an Ohio-class ballistic missile submarine, on the Eastern Test Range off the coast of Cape Canaveral, Florida, September 17, 2021. /Screenshot via navy.mil

Editor's note: Hamzah Rifaat Hussain, former visiting fellow at the Stimson Center in Washington and former assistant researcher at the Islamabad Policy Research Institute, is a TV anchor at Indus News in Pakistan. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN. Right after forging the controversial ""Allies Alliance,"" which has earned the ire of France with countries such as New Zealand not expected to follow suit, the U.S. Navy conducted a two missile test launch involving the nuclear Trident D5LE from the USS Wyoming.

The ballistic missile submarine completed the tests off the coast of Cape Canaveral in Florida, which are a part of a shakedown operation termed ""DASO 31."" The launch demonstrates how 184 missile test flights were successfully conducted. Yet, at the same time, this decision to test nuclear missiles with strategic posturing directed at China is an affront to the nuclear nonproliferation government. The reasons are obvious. If examined further, the planned DASO exercise will be conducted with the sole aim of gauging the health and durability of ballistic nuclear missile submarines. The nuclear dimensions involved in the operations complemented by the provocative alliance of Australia, the UK and the U.S. (AUKUS) pose further questions as to whether such American experiments would reinforce or challenge peace and stability across the globe. It is undeniable that strategic deterrence and a global understanding that nuclear weapons deployment challenges balances of power are critical for world peace. Yet, General Johnny R. Wolff, director of the U.S. Navy's Strategic Systems Program, claimed that there are further plans to develop a next-generation Trident weapons system that will enhance America's strategic deterrence at sea for the next 63 years. The question is about the exact threat that the U.S. is seeking to thwart with such comprehensive deterrence. The answer lies in the timing of the tests, which is critical given that the problematic AUKUS alliance was just inked. While the U.S. Navy has denied that these tests are a response to unfolding global events, the fact is that the fleets of 14 American Ohio-class submarines continue to carry 24 Trident missiles with eight nuclear warheads.

Editor's note: John Gong is a professor at the University of International Business and Economics and a research fellow at the Academy of China Open Economy Studies at UIBE. The article reflects the author's views and not necessarily those of CGTN. The formation of AUKUS, which is billed as a new geopolitical and security partnership among the U.S., the UK and Australia to coordinate on cyber issues, advanced technologies and defense in order to counter security challenges in the Indo-Pacific, seen by many as a metaphor for China, appears on the surface to be a major strategic shift in Washington's alliance-based China policy.

But digging deeper, there are indications to show that this is mostly about money ¨C a naked pretense to a grab prey from a weaker predator, and thus it may not be interpreted too much out of context from a geopolitical perspective, although its viciousness and maliciousness from a commercial dealing ethics perspective should be widely condemned by the international community. The center of the AUKUS pack is the submarine deal. The U.S. and the UK will help Australia build and maintain nuclear-powered submarines, making it potentially the seventh country in the world to acquire such powerful underwater capability. But it also shred apart an existing deal worth $66 billion under which Australia is supposed to purchase 12 Attack-class conventional submarines from France's Naval Group. Paris went ballistic on hearing the news; its Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian called the AUKUS deal a ""stab in the back,"" ""a brutal, unilateral and unpredictable decision that reminded him of former president Donald Trump."" Paris later recalled its ambassadors to the U.S. and Australian in retaliation. But interestingly, French ambassador to Britain has saved the trip back home. Le Monde newspaper called the decision to not recall him an ""odd exception."" According to a report in Washington Post on September 18th quoting a French diplomatic official, ""the UK tagged along with this entire operation opportunistically,"" and was seen by Paris as a junior partner in the three-nation defense pact.

Why do efforts to disintegrate China-Africa relationship fare badly?,"Editor's note: Azhar Azam works in a private organization as market and business analyst and writes about geopolitical issues and regional conflicts. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily those of CGTN.

Every year, China hosts around 1,000 African professionals, including journalists and 80,000 students ¨C double the size of those who travel to the U.S., making it the top training and education destination for Africa. Second only to France, the East Asian country has launched 62 language and cultural centers (Confucius Institutes) on the continent.

Besides overtaking the British Council, Germany's Goethe Institute and the American Centers, China displaced the U.S. as Africa's largest trade partner in 2009, with the bilateral trade hitting as high as $200 billion in 2020.

Over the last decade, Beijing played a central role in financing and became the largest financer of infrastructure in Africa, covering 6,000 kilometers of railways and highways, 20 ports, 80 large-scale power facilities, 130 medical institutions, 45 stadiums and 170 schools.

A number of studies have rebuffed claims about China's alleged predatory lending practices, neocolonialism, pillage of natural resources, land grabs and import of Chinese workers for construction projects. The independent investigations further found Chinese firms were hiring up to 90 percent local workforce and ""really"" investing and developing African infrastructure.

It is often contended that bilateral trade benefits China more than Africa. The latest trade data debunked this assertion, showing that Chinese imports from its all-season ally had risen by 46.3 percent in the first seven months of the year. Over the last 20 years, flow of Chinese investments in Africa has also surged by more than 25 percent on a yearly-average basis, hitting $2.1 billion for the period.

Still, Beijing's approach to create new bonds of affinity with Africa and African people continues to vex the observers. They view China's unreserved engagement in Africa as an effort to build ""soft power,"" secure financial interests, gain a strategic sphere of influence and galvanize support on multilateral forums.

Even though China-Africa Peace and Security Forum extended commitment to common, comprehensive, collaborative and sustainable security, the initiative to shape Africa's peacekeeping capacity, strengthen defense and military cooperation and channel funds through the United Nations Peace and Development Trust Fund are irrationally linked with gaining a strong foothold in the continent.

The bloody conflicts in many parts of Africa, such as Lake Chad Basin, Mozambique's Cabo Delgado, Gulf of Guiana, Somalia and Ethiopian Tigray, threaten to impede economic growth. Beijing's security inputs have assisted the region to achieve peace and security objectives to advance a sustainable socioeconomic development.

For African nations, China's development model to push growth and alleviate poverty offers a definitive version for modernization and transformation of regional economies. The unique mix of transparent, accountable and rules-based cooperation serves the core interests of the continent and the people.

Beijing is neither part of any global competition to dominate Africa nor does it want to capture the continent. What fascinates African states is China's inspirational development, whose experience the world's second largest economy has been more than willing to share, to drive Africa to forge its own economic path.

The growing Chinese influence stokes fears in the U.S. for being sidelined by China on the continent. Washington tried best to contaminate the minds of African governments about Chinese technological companies. However, most of them haven't succumbed to the U.S. bullying as at least 266 Chinese technology initiatives are underway across the region.

Africa seeks to harness digital technologies and innovation to transform societies and economies to promote regional integration, speed up economic growth, stimulate job creation and break the digital divide for socioeconomic development.

China's commitment to foster digital collaboration, ranging from 5G to data centers, smart cities and skills and education programs, is deliberately advertised as a threat to Africa's security and sovereignty."
Hong Kong is up and running again,"Editor's note: CGTN's First Voice provides instant commentary on breaking stories. The daily column clarifies emerging issues and better defines the news agenda, offering a Chinese perspective on the latest global events.

The results of the 2021 Election Committee's subsector ordinary elections in China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) were unveiled on September 20 morning: 364 people made it to the committee.

This was the first election held in the HKSAR following the disruption posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. The region's Electoral Committee is endowed with important functions under the region's improved electoral system, which includes nominating candidates for the chief executive election, electing the chief executive designate, nominating candidates for the Legislative Council (LegCo) election and electing part of LegCo members.

Despite what critics say, the new electoral system in the HKSAR is a firm demonstration of how the city is upholding democracy, stability and prosperity in line with ""One Country, Two Systems,"" tailored to the city's unique needs and as stipulated by the Basic Law. It has also established a way forward as a safeguard to ensure that those who govern the city will be patriots, and not those sponsored by foreign forces who seek to undermine, sabotage or damage the system.

Hong Kong is a region of China which has been granted a ""high degree of autonomy"" in managing its affairs, which include its own free market economic system, a legal system as well as its own local bureaucracy. In order to handle these matters, the city has its own institutions including the chief executive, the legislative council and district councils. Likewise, it has long been established that a process of local democracy is utilized in order to elect their officials, which citizens and various societal groups in the region participate in.

However, these institutions have recently run into difficulty as they have frequently become targets of foreign powers who sought to utilize the features of local democracy not to simply handle local affairs on a policy level, but as a medium to promote separatism, secessionism, subversion and to undermine China itself. The HKSAR institutions were never designed to promote the idea that the city was ""not"" a part of China or to become a platform for sponsoring unrest or infiltration. Yet, this is what it had become over the past few years with the onset of the riots."

Editor's note: Hayat Bangash is a freelance columnist on international affairs with degrees in business administration and war studies. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

The joint statement of the new security alliance of Australia, the UK and the U.S. (AUKUS) once again brought into light a term that has remained elusive ever since its seepage into Western strategic discourse. The international rules-based order, as it is called, is yet to find a clear definition despite its increased usage since the turn of the century.

As the U.S. has disengaged from its wars in the Middle East and Afghanistan, its focus has turned toward limiting China's peaceful economic rise. Allusions of rules-based order have thereon been largely used to interpret the global governance system as per the wishes of the U.S.

Shirley V. Scott, an Australian academic in international law, has extensively documented how America's allies have mimicked and exaggerated ""the rhetorical shift from international law to rules-based order."" Over the years, Australia and the UK's national security documents as well as their leaders' speeches have been dropping the use of the former concept in favor of the latter.

There is, of course, a method to that shift. U.S. leadership of the so-called free world is somehow symbolized by the rules-based order, which the U.S., along with its allies, considers something to be protected as it deliberately avoids mentions of international law.

If U.S. policymakers continue to talk about upholding international law, the first fingers will be pointed right back at them. Unilateral American sanctions will be stamped as economic warfare, ignoring the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) to invade countries will mean unwarrantable aggression, and refusing to sign a multitude of international treaties while advocating others for the opposite will plainly come off as American exceptionalism.

The references to rules-based order had gathered steam after the invasion of Iraq in 2003, as charted by University of Chicago Professor Paul Post. Since the invasion sidestepped the only institution established as an inhibitor to such belligerence, the UNSC, it could not be defended under international law.

An embrace of this new expression thus came in handy. The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan continued unrelentingly despite the circumvention of the UN and the drummed-up charges of weapons of mass destruction. The U.S. went on claiming that it was liberating countries and a system was offered ¨C to quote the international relations theorist G. John Ikenberry ¨C where America rules the world but does not abide by the rules.

Now that American wars in impoverished countries are winding up, upholding the rules-based order has morphed into a euphemism for counteracting China.

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken stated in May that the purpose of the Biden administration is not to ""contain China, to hold it back, to keep it down."" As the administration chose to retain many of the irrational policies of the previous American president, the purpose has proven to be anything but."
Can the Beijing Stock Exchange spur innovation and inclusive growth?,"Editor's note: Alexander Ayertey Odonkor is an economic consultant, chartered financial analyst and chartered economist with an in-depth understanding of the economic landscape of countries in Asia and Africa. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

The Beijing Stock Exchange opened its doors for registration of investors on September 17, 2021. The new stock exchange is the Chinese mainland's third bourse after the Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE) and the Shenzhen Stock Exchange (SZSE), which were established in 1990.

Designed to support innovative startups and high-growth small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), this securities market has been instrumental in strengthening access to finance for SMEs in China.

While SMEs are an integral component of the Chinese economy, the growth of some of these businesses is usually hampered by financial constraints ¨C a major challenge that the global economy has been grappling with for many years. Considered as the backbone of any development model, a robust SMEs sector fosters innovation and promotes an inclusive green growth which is essential for achieving sustainable development. Typically, SMEs represent the largest share of all enterprises; this situation is not different in China.

In China, SMEs account for over 90 percent of all businesses, provide 80 percent of total jobs and contribute more than 60 percent of the country's gross domestic product (GDP).

Serving as an engine of growth and a major driver of innovation, the collective contribution of SMEs to China's patents exceeds 70 percent of the country's total.

As a result of the considerable contribution of SMEs in research and development (R&D), China once again emerged as the world's top filer of international patents in 2020 with 68,720 applications, representing a 16.1 percent increase over the previous year.

In spite of the significant contributions of the SMEs sector to the Chinese economy, the growth of many of these enterprises has been retarded mainly as a result of financial constraint, which is limiting the innovation capacity of SMEs in the country. However, in recent years policymakers in China have been consistent in their approach to address this exigent challenge in an effort to spur innovation and boost inclusive growth."

Editor's note: Daryl Guppy is an international financial technical analysis expert and national board member of the Australia China Business Council, who has provided weekly Shanghai Index analysis for mainland Chinese media for more than a decade. He also appears regularly on CNBC Asia and is known as ""The Chart Man."" The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison has done more to undermine the Western alliance than any adversary has been able to achieve since NATO was founded.

Australia's decision to cancel the French deal to build a new Australian submarine force was supported by NATO foundation allies. Australia's replacement submarine will come from either the United States or the UK.

Jean-Yves Le Drian, the French foreign minister said, ""this is a stab in the back"" delivered by NATO allies at the behest of Australia.

This decision was never directly relayed to Emmanuel Marcon. He found out from the media, undermining the trust that is the foundation of the NATO agreement. In June, Macron described the contract as a ""pillar of the partnership and of the relationship of trust between the two countries."" Now Macron feels betrayed by a ""friend"" and two foundational partners of NATO.

U.S. President Joe Biden is generating a distrust factor almost as great as former President Donald Trump. NATO adversaries could only dream of creating this type of split.

Generally, nation states do not walk away from or default on multibillion-dollar commercial deals with other nation states because this sends the wrong signal to the international investment community. The higher the perceived sovereign risk, the more expensive it is for the country to borrow on international credit markets and the more reluctant business is to invest in the country.

Australia has already started down this path with the introduction of legislation that allows the Foreign Investment Review Board to retrospectively overturn investment decisions and force companies to divest these investments years after the first commercial decision had been made. The potential overturning of the Darwin Port lease is the next test of commercial trust.

Walking away from the French submarine deal is a significant event. This is a repudiation of a state-to-state commercial arrangement and begs the most important investment question: Can Australia be trusted?

The immediate answer is that it cannot be trusted to honor its commercial commitments. The countries scattered throughout the Indo-Pacific region, the region Australia coverts, have been delivered a strong message in relation to trust and the risk of doing business with Australia.

Australia's lack of commitment to the evacuation of all Afghan interpreters and support staff who had worked for the Australians had already caused some disquiet in the region. Australia backed its fine-sounding words about support with actions that were too little and delivered too late."
Hong Kong's improved electoral system offers people real hope,"Editor's note: Grenville Cross, a senior counsel and law professor, was previously director of public prosecutions of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), China. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily those of CGTN.

In 2020-21, there will, over a seven-month period, be three sets of elections in Hong Kong, each highly significant. Whereas the elections for the 1,500-member Hong Kong Special Administration Region (HKSAR) Election Committee are taking place on September 19, 2021, these will be followed by the Legislative Council elections on December 19, and the Chief Executive election on March 27, 2022.

Elections as a means of choosing the city's officials are enshrined in the Basic Law. It describes universal suffrage as the ""ultimate aim"" in the choosing of both the Chief Executive and the Legislative Council, although disruptive elements have frustrated the process. But, despite recent difficulties, this objective remains unchanged.

The coming elections are the first since the National People's Congress overhauled the electoral system in March, and put the city back on track. After anti-China forces declared war on society in 2019-20, reform became unavoidable. If the ""one country, two systems"" governing policy for Hong Kong had not been improved, it could have failed altogether. This, of course, was exactly what some people wanted, as they knew this would advance the policy agendas of China's geopolitical rivals, to whom they were beholden.

This was why, for example, the district council seats had to be removed from the Election Committee. Under the Basic Law (Art.97), district organizations are ""not organs of political power"", yet their seats fell into the hands of people obsessed with political posturing and anti-China activity. Systematic abuse was poisoning the body politic, and could no longer be tolerated. Changes, therefore, were essential to ensure that the electoral system produced responsible governance, not political mayhem.

On March 11, the Chinese Premier Li Keqiang explained that the electoral reforms would help Hong Kong to remain stable and prosperous, which was exactly what most people wanted to hear. He said that ""to insist on 'patriots administering Hong Kong' is to ensure the long-term implementation of one country, two systems"", and this was quite true.

Although the Central authorities could have despaired over the chaos, they retained their faith in Hong Kong and its capacity to turn things round. They recognized how external forces were encouraging their local proxies to wreck the city, believing this would undermine China.

The Election Committee that is now being formed will comprise 982 elected members, 156 nominated members, and 362 ex officio members. In early August, the HKSAR government announced that it had received 1,056 nominations for the contested seats, compared to 1,539 at the last vote in 2016. The lower figure this time is not surprising, as many of those who stood previously have now realized that their brand of fanaticism has had its day.

The Election Committee has been expanded from 1,200 to 1,500 members, with a 300-seat fifth sub-sector added to the existing four sub-sectors, each also comprising 300 seats. This has made it more representative, and it allows more voices to be heard.

There is, for example, now room for people with national perspectives and cross-border experience, including local members of the NPC, the CPPCC and the representatives of associations of Hong Kong residents in the Chinese mainland. Although this has obviously made the body less parochial, full regard has nonetheless been had to local conditions. Indeed, Wang Chen, vice chairman of the NPC Standing Committee, has noted that its design is ""aimed to form a new democratic electoral system suited to Hong Kong's realities, and with Hong Kong characteristics"".

The Election Committee's functions include choosing the Chief Executive, electing 40 of the 90 members to the Legislative Council, and nominating its other members. Although its immediate concerns are with local governance, there are also national ramifications. Quite clearly, therefore, these responsibilities can only be discharged by trustworthy individuals who have the country's best interests at heart, and not by people allied to foreign powers. In other words, they must be patriotic and committed to defending national security."
How a 'righteous strike' became a 'horrible mistake',"When a drone attack on August 29 led to the deaths of 10 people, including seven children, U.S. officials quickly called it a ""righteous strike."" They insisted the American military had authorized the attack after tracking Zamarai Ahmadi, who had driven a sedan around Kabul for hours before parking outside a supposed ISIS-K safe house. They further claimed that items being placed inside Ahmadi's car could be used in another terrorist attack against the U.S. military, who were bogged down at the Hamid Karzai International Airport trying to complete the massive evacuation of American diplomats and private citizens from the U.S. and Afghanistan. In truth, the items being placed in the car were nothing more than water jugs.

Entman found that the U.S. media accepted the U.S. government's assertions that immediately pointed the finger of blame directly at the Kremlin for the tragedy involving the South Korean plane. Five years later, they ascribed no such blame to the White House for the actions of the U.S. military. The media framed the story consistent with the narrative they had created about the two nations. The Soviet Union was an amoral country that placed no value on human life while the United States was led by honorable people who would never deliberately kill private citizens.

Robert Entman examined news reporting of two horrific events: the shooting down of a Korean Air Lines plane by a Soviet military jet in 1983 and the shooting down of an Iran Air flight by the U.S. military five years later. The events were eerily similar: Hundreds of innocent people died because a military leader authorized a strike on a passenger plane that had no chance to avoid its fate.

It was 30 years ago when a leading communication scholar published a seminal article looking at how the U.S. government and military can influence news coverage.

Editor's note: Anthony Moretti is an associate professor at the Department of Communication and Organizational Leadership of Robert Morris University. The article reflects the author's views and not necessarily those of CGTN.

The U.S.-authorized strike happened just days after a deadly attack carried out by ISIS-K killed at least 170 Afghan civilians, and 13 U.S. service members, at the gates of the airport. The military increased the palpable fear throughout the city (and in the U.S.) by saying they believed ISIS-K would try to carry out further attacks before the evacuation efforts ended at the end of August.

The bitter reality is that ISIS-K had carried out a terrorist attack, and it was eager to do it again. The even more bitter reality is that Ahmadi and the nine other people killed in the U.S. drone strike were not terrorists. They were innocent people, and seven of them were kids.

As I listened to the news on Friday, I had a ""here we go again"" moment. The military was again apologizing profusely for a ""horrible mistake."" And I knew that at some point in the future the mainstream U.S. media would get in line and back the military's new narrative.

The irony was it was some of those same U.S. news agencies that had blown apart the ""righteous strike"" story, which forced the military to acknowledge the terrible error they had made.

The evidence that the U.S. military had made that ""horrible mistake"" began to be uncovered almost instantly. But the military remained silent, even though multiple news organizations had pieced together what had happened and demanded the military respond to it. The Washington Post reported Ahmadi was doing nothing more than carrying out ""mundane errands against the backdrop of the city's humanitarian crisis"" in the hours before he was murdered.

The general who issued the apology on Friday was already beginning to promote the ""honorable America"" theme. According to the Washington Post, ""Gen. Kenneth 'Frank' McKenzie, who heads U.S. Central Command and had oversight of the Afghanistan mission as it came to an end last month, said Friday that officials were assessing whether anyone would be held responsible for the errant strike. The U.S. government, McKenzie added, is discussing 'ex gratia' payments to compensate the victims' families.""

Of course, there will be investigations in Washington. Republicans will attempt to blame President Joe Biden for failed leadership, while Democrats will suggest in the chaos that was Kabul that decent men and women can do something that in hindsight was found to be wrong. There will be talk of filing charges against one or more people, but that will never happen. Promises will be made about being more cautious in the future. Life will carry on.

Now just imagine how official Washington would be reacting if a certain other country had murdered 10 people in cold blood. They would demand international investigations. They would quickly announce sanctions against multiple people. They would ask the International Criminal Court to uncover the truth. But none of that will be of interest because what happened in Kabul was just a ""horrible mistake.""

The SCO is an organization for countries in Central Asia and the immediate region. Since its establishment 20 years ago, the organization has made remarkable achievements and acquired growing prominence. It is time to evaluate what the SCO is and what it aims to do.

President Xi answered the questions succinctly, stressing that the SCO explored a new ground both theoretically and practically, with a goal of building a new type of international relations and a community of shared future for mankind.

In fact, cooperation under anarchy is an age-old conundrum in international relations. For Central Asia, it is especially the case. For geopolitical and historical reasons, the region has been afflicted with political instability, religious strife and ethnic conflict, and often suffered invasion and intervention by outside forces. Thus, effective security cooperation is a top priority for regional countries.

The founding of the SCO is an endeavor in this direction. In order to foster cooperation, the SCO is coalesced around the ""Shanghai Spirit"" that features equality, mutual trust, mutual benefit, consultation, and respect for diversity of civilizations.

What the SCO isn't

From the above, we can see that the SCO is clearly aimed at building a new type of regional security organization, which differs from the outdated models. President Xi made this vision poignant by making veiled rebukes to the Western-centric practices.

He stressed that the SCO is based on ""partnership and dialogue rather than alliance or confrontation."" This philosophy underlying China's foreign policy has proven to be a new route to break out of the security dilemma which is seen as inevitable in Western international relations theories.

He also rejected ""condescending lecturing"" by outsiders and firmly supported countries in exploring development paths and governance models that are compatible with their national conditions.

By quoting the Chinese saying ""Power may win for the time being, but justice will prevail for the long run,"" he criticized the ""position of strength"" proposed by the U.S. as a way of pushing hegemony and bullying around the world.

Besides, President Xi reiterated the SCO's commitment to practicing ""true multilateralism"" and opposed using the so-called ""rules"" to undermine the international order and cause confrontation and division. Instead he urged for the abidance of the United Nations Charter and adherence to the principle of ""consultation, joint contribution and shared benefit."""
Is AUKUS already backfiring on America?,"Editor's note: Andrew Korybko is a Moscow-based American political analyst. The article reflects the author's views and not necessarily those of CGTN.

The leaders of Australia, the UK, and the U.S. announced a new trilateral military alliance on September 15 ¨C called AUKUS ¨C which will facilitate the sharing of technological information between them. This will include cooperation on artificial intelligence (AI), cyber issues, long-range strike capabilities, quantum computing, and underwater systems. Although not openly stated, their leaders made it obvious that it's meant to ""contain"" China in the Asia-Pacific as part of their latest act of unprovoked aggression against it in the new Cold War.

As the saying goes, ""the best-laid plans of mice and men often go awry,"" and AUKUS is already backfiring on America. Far from acting as a catalyst for uniting its allies against China, this alliance is actually exacerbating differences among them. The clearest evidence of this is French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian's condemnation of the initiative's flagship project to have the UK and the U.S. help Australia obtain a fleet of nuclear-powered submarines.

The continent-sized country will abandon its prior AUS$90 billion ($66 billion) deal with Paris on these vessels that were plagued with problems over the past few years. The minister said that ""This is really a stab in the back. We have established a relationship of trust with Australia. This trust has been undermined. And today I am angry over the termination of this contract."" His sharp remarks came despite U.S. President Joe Biden praising France's role in what his country and its allies have recently taken to calling the ""Indo-Pacific.""

According to the American leader, ""France, in particular, already has a substantial Indo-Pacific presence and is a key partner and ally in strengthening the security and prosperity of the region. The United States looks forward to working closely with France and other key countries as we go forward."" While it's true that France is a player in this region due to the lasting legacy of its colonial-era possessions there, Washington's smooth words weren't enough to placate Paris after it just lost out on what its media referred to as the ""Contract of the Century."""
The Election Committee polls: A new beginning for Hong Kong,"Editor's note: Zhu Zheng is an assistant professor focusing on constitutional law and politics at China University of Political Science and Law. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

The 2021 Hong Kong Election Committee will be chosen on September 19. This will be the first election in the city under the new rules coined by the National People's Congress (NPC) and its Standing Committee that will directly impact the ensuing two pivotal elections: the Legislative Council election on December 19 this year and the Chief Executive election on March 27 next year.

According to the newly revised Annexes I and II to the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), the new Election Committee (EC) will be composed of 1,500 members, who must be Hong Kong permanent residents. Besides, under the Improving Electoral System (Consolidated Amendments) Ordinance 2021, which was introduced by the Government of the HKSAR and came into effect on May 31, 2021, the EC will be responsible for nominating candidates for the Chief Executive and Legislative Council elections.

After years of stagnation, turmoil and unrest, Hong Kong eventually makes peace with itself. The territory's future will hinge upon the upcoming elections, which will decide who governs Hong Kong in the years to come, and without doubt, will also be a far cry from previous polls for the following two reasons.

First, the positions are only reserved for competent ""patriots,"" Under the new principle of ""patriots governing Hong Kong,"" those unpatriotic Legislative Council candidates will be weeded out and ""pawns of anti-China forces"" will be knocked out once and for all, according to Wang Chen, vice chairman of the NPC, when he explained the improvement of the electoral system.

Indeed, the enlarged Election Committee comprising five sectors and 23 subsectors has been filled uncontested with 1,084 members, leaving only 364 seats open for competition among 412 candidates. And compared with Election Committee polls held in 2016, there will be fewer seats and a reduced electorate, resulting in lower intensity of competition.

Yet it is by no means an unfair election. For one thing, there are still seats open for the opposition parties ¨C as long as they pledge allegiance to the Special Administrative Region and the Basic Law, and do not harm the country and the region. For another thing, competence is still required in the contest and no seats are reserved for self-styled patriots of questionable competence."

He is the founder of AK Consultancy and former chairman of the International Affairs Committee at Bow Group, the oldest conservative think tank in the UK. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

It is hard to imagine the level of anger and humiliation of President Emanuel Macron when he received a letter from Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Wednesday morning announcing the decision to cancel a $40 billion contract agreed in 2016 to buy 12 of France's Naval Group conventional submarines in favor of nuclear-powered submarines built with U.S. technology.

You then try to reach the U.S. administration to ask what is going on, and you are being given some explanation only three hours before you see U.S. President Joe Biden, along with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison and UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, on a TV screen announcing a new U.S.-led security alliance (known as AUKUS) between the three countries that would concentrate on their joint Indo-Pacific strategy.

Indeed, you have every right to feel betrayed as, without any doubt, that feels like ""a stab in the back,"" which should not take place ""between allies,"" let alone long-term friends. It just makes you realize that although Donald Trump left the office, his ""America First"" code of conduct seems to be still in use.

""The American choice to exclude a European ally and partner such as France from a structuring partnership with Australia, at a time when we are facing unprecedented challenges in the Indo-Pacific region, whether in terms of our values or in terms of respect for multilateralism based on the rule of law, shows a lack of coherence that France can only note and regret,"" we could read in a joint statement released by French Foreign Minister Jean-yves Le Drian and Armed Forces Minister Florence Parly.

The statement called France ""the only European nation present in the Indo-Pacific with nearly two million citizens and more than 7,000 military personnel,"" and affirmed that the country is a ""reliable partner that will continue to fulfill its commitments, as it has always done.""

Despite all of your good intentions, the ""trop c'est trop"" moment slowly kicks in, and you decide to cancel an upcoming reception at the French Embassy in Washington D.C. that had been planned to mark the 240th anniversary of the Battle of Capes, in which your countrymen stood by Americans' side in their fight for independence from the British Crown ¨C which is itself highly symbolic."

Editor's note: Hamzah Rifaat Hussain, former visiting fellow at the Stimson Center in Washington and former assistant researcher at the Islamabad Policy Research Institute, is a TV anchor at Indus News in Pakistan. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN. It is now an established fact that the U.S.-led war in Afghanistan was a massive strategic blunder which has brought nothing but destitution, insecurity and a crippling economy for the average Afghan citizen. That being said, the Pentagon has now acknowledged that the drone strike on August 29 aimed at the Islamic State, was a tragic mistake as it killed 10 civilians including seven children. This admission reaffirms the fact that America's drone legacy is brazenly toxic with civilian lives constituting collateral damage in counter terrorism operations. This is simply unpardonable in Afghanistan and beyond.

The death of Zemari Ahmadi who was a driver and longtime worker for an American aid group, is a stark reminder that Afghan civilians have continued to bear the brunt of gross miscalculations within their own territories given that Ahmadi had nothing to do with ISIS. As per General Kenneth F. Mckenzie Jr. the Commander of the U.S. Central Command, the strike against Ahmadi was carried out based on a ""profound belief"" and not absolute certainty that a correct target would be struck, which was later corroborated by a New York Times investigation. U.S. history is replete with such controversial tactics, as this attack is eerily similar to previous gross miscalculations of terrorist targets in countries such as Pakistan and Yemen over the years, where a spike in civilian casualties has resulted in pervasive anti-American sentiment taking hold. It also contributed towards, the unmitigated potency of terrorist organizations. The divisive drone legacy of the U.S. in Afghanistan, is however linked to broader failures constituting the entire modus operandi of the war on terror. Assessments from America's own think tanks such as the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) document how unmanned combat aerial vehicles (UCAVs) were solely responsible for civilian deaths in Afghanistan, Iraq and Pakistan despite the ratio to militant casualties being considerably smaller.

Editor's note: Li Juan is a researcher and lecturer at the Human Rights Institute of Southwest University of Political Science and Law. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

On September 14, the 48th session of the United Nations (UN) Human Rights Council held a dialogue with the High Commissioner for Human Rights. Jiang Duan, the minister of the Chinese mission to the UN in Geneva made a joint speech on behalf of a group of countries, pointing out that the United States and its allies had been fighting Afghanistan for 20 years and the U.S.-led military intervention in Afghanistan is the root cause of the humanitarian disaster in Afghanistan.

The joint statement called on the High Commissioner for Human Rights to continue to pay attention to the serious negative impact of military intervention by these countries on the human rights of the Afghan people, and to hold their soldiers accountable for crimes such as killing Afghan civilians.

The series of U.S. military operations in Afghanistan have indeed caused serious human rights violations and severely violated international humanitarian law.

Firstly, the U.S. airstrikes in Afghanistan caused a large number of civilian casualties. On August 29, 2021, the U.S. military launched an air raid and destroyed a residential house in Kabul, killing a family of 10, including seven children. The youngest was only two years old. On October 3, 2015, the medical charity ""Doctors Without Borders"" was attacked by U.S. airstrike in Kunduz, killing 19 people, 12 medical staff, seven patients including three children. The laws of war permit attacks only against military objectives, civilians are immune from attack. Attacks that target civilians, that are indiscriminate, or that cause disproportionate civilian loss are unlawful.

Secondly, there are a lot of abuses of prisoners. In 2016, the U.S. Department of Defense was forced to publish hundreds of photos of prisoners abused by U.S. troops stationed in Afghanistan. In 2020, the chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court stated that there is evidence that nearly 100 Afghan prisoners were tortured, abused and even raped during the interrogation.

It is quite ironic that the U.S. initially took military intervention in Afghanistan to fight terrorism and solve the human rights issues of the Afghan people, but it brought disaster to Afghanistan. But this result is not unexpected.

First, on the balance between protecting human rights and U.S. national interests, the U.S. always chooses the latter. Therefore, in military operations in Afghanistan, the U.S. put its national interests above the right to life of Afghan civilians, which also reflects the double standards adopted by the U.S. government."
Exclusive with Ahmad Wali Massoud on Taliban Rule,"Although the Taliban say Panjshir Valley is now under their control, the Afghanistan resistance movement recently released a photograph of Northern Alliance leader Ahmad Massoud from Panjshir Valley. He called on the Western countries to support anti-Taliban forces in an audio message. Tian Wei got a chance to talk exclusively with Ahmad Wali Massoud, the brother of the late elder Panjshir resistance leader, Ahmad Shah Massoud. Wali Massoud served as the former Afghan ambassador to the United Kingdom, and chairs the Massoud Foundation. He told CGTN that his nephew is safe and rejected reports of intensive fighting in the Panjshir valley. Despite the roads being blocked in the mountainous area, resistance fighters are not giving up."
Exclusive with Ahmad Wali Massoud on Humanitarian Situation,"The United Nations convenes an international aid conference in Geneva to help shore up much-needed aid for Afghanistan on Sep. 13. The UN called for more than $600 million in emergency funds to help tide over vulnerable Afghans facing famine and violence. After the Taliban announced the caretaker government last week, the top UN envoy to Afghanistan did appeal for uninterrupted aid to ease the dire humanitarian situation. Food and jobs are harder to come by for many Afghans, forcing millions to seek refuge within and outside the nation's borders. For its part, China has pledged some 31 million dollars -- that's 200 million yuan -- worth of grain, winter supplies and vaccines to Afghanistan. Neighboring Pakistan has sent oil and other supplies to Kabul while Russia plans to ship food and medicine. What more can the international community do to help Afghanistan? Could the UN call for more aid be answered?"

Editor's note: William Jones is a Washington policy analyst and a Non-resident Fellow of the Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

Did anyone imagine that the British Empire was a thing of the past? The latest moves by the Biden administration clearly indicate that it has been reincarnated under U.S. leadership and that the old ""gunboat diplomacy"" which in the 19th century was led by Her Royal Majesty Victoria is now being led by an American President. President John Quincy Adams warned long ago that the United States should never become ""a cockboat in the wake of a British man-of-war"".

Little did he imagine that the British - and now their Australian subjects - would become a ""cockboat in the wake of an American man-of-war."" The Brits are not taking this amiss, of course, since this allows Great Britain to become ""Global Britain"", again.

And the Aussies, ecstatic over the invitation to join the U.S.-British ""special relationship"" for all their talk of being independent, have always prided themselves on being part of that great mother, the British Commonwealth. And dreams of empire have never died in old Albion.

President Biden is also flaunting Adams' other advice about not going out and ""seeking monsters to destroy."" The ""monster"" in this case is the People's Republic of China, and while Biden is probably not intent on destroying it, he is intent on forcing China to kowtow to the rule of the ""Anglo-American Order.""

This is done under the pretext of preserving the post-World War II order, but this is all a hoax. The post-war order envisioned by Franklin Roosevelt was definitely not envisioned as an Anglo-American, or even a Western-dominated order.

Roosevelt made clear to Churchill that in the post-war world, he would not adopt Churchill's ""18th century methods."" There would be new nations brought into the world community like China and India, with very different cultures than in the West, and, yes, the Soviet Union would be an integral part of this order. This is the post-war world order that China and Russia are in fact defending. But with the death of Roosevelt, Churchill made a comeback, as did his 18th century methods."
What COVID-19 revealed about hunger,"Editor's note: Brittany Kesselman is a postdoctoral research fellow at the Society, Work and Politics Institute at the University of Witwatersrand in South Africa. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

In South Africa, many people struggle to access sufficient quantities of healthy food. Because their diets are high in processed foods, refined starch, sugar and fat, they face a double burden of malnutrition and obesity, or what is known as ""hidden hunger."" It is hidden because it does not fit the stereotypical image of hunger created by media coverage of famines. But it is everywhere.

To be clear, the problem is not a shortage of food. In South Africa, hunger is a result of lack of access. Getting enough calories and adequate nutrients is largely tied to income. Beyond the high cost of healthy food, hidden hunger in the country reflects the limited availability of nutritious products in low-income areas, the cost of energy for cooking and food storage and lack of access to land for household food production.

The COVID-19 pandemic and the strict measures imposed to contain its spread brought hidden hunger out of hiding, as many people who had been able to afford just enough food to survive suddenly found themselves going without. According to one study, 47 percent of households ran out of money to buy food during the early stages of the initial lockdown in April 2020. Job losses, a crackdown on informal vendors and price increases caused by interruptions in global food and agriculture supply chains all contributed to a sharp rise in food insecurity. Images of long lines for emergency food assistance brought the issue into public view. Increased levels of child hunger in particular were worrying, but unsurprising, given the abrupt closure of schools and school-based nutrition programs.

The pandemic also made the consequences of hidden hunger more apparent. Because adequate nutrition is necessary for a healthy immune system, food-insecure individuals are more likely to become ill. Additionally, there is a correlation between the severity of COVID-19 and diabetes, a disease associated with poor diets. Data from Cape Town suggest that COVID-19 patients with diabetes were almost four times more likely to be hospitalized and over three times more likely to die from COVID-19 than patients without diabetes.

But while COVID-19 increased food insecurity and highlighted the consequences of hunger, it also produced potential solutions for increasing access to affordable, healthy food. In the face of disruptions to global supply chains, more localized food systems began to emerge. Where the government failed to implement adequate measures to offset the economic repercussions of lockdowns or the closure of school nutrition programs, civil-society groups sought to fill the void. Across South Africa, community action networks sprang up to address hunger, with volunteers providing meals and other assistance to fellow community members."
SCO contribution to stability shines amid uncertainty in Afghanistan,"Editor's note: CGTN's First Voice provides instant commentary on breaking stories. The daily column clarifies emerging issues and better defines the news agenda, offering a Chinese perspective on the latest global events.

The chaotic situation created by the irresponsible U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan has rattled its neighbors.

At this uncertain moment the vision of shared regional development, respect for sovereignty and mutual cooperation to fight radicalism and terrorism represented by the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) is more important than ever.

The U.S. actions in Afghanistan are a perfect example of why trying to impose hegemony with force will always fail.

By butting into the internal affairs of Afghanistan, the U.S. actually froze the development of the country for decades.

U.S. officials may have believed they were ""nation building,"" but in fact their attempt to impose a friendly client state at the point of a gun simply ended up created an extended civil war and propping up a bloated and corrupt government that collapsed the moment the U.S. retreated.

Afghanistan understandably is a central concern at this year's SCO meeting. The initial impetus of the organization was, after all, to combat extremism and terrorism in the region and protect the security of all the member states.

Obviously, the fast-evolving situation in Afghanistan is of concern to all members of the organization.

In the spirit of respecting each other's sovereignty, SCO members are taking a circumspect attitude. Adhering to the commitment of not to interfering in the internal affairs of others, many nations including China hope Afghanistan chooses its development path based on its actual conditions ¨C and are ready to help if Kabul asks.

This doesn't just follow ""the golden rule"" of international politics. As we have seen from the U.S. example, meddling always backfires."
Toward a future in space,"Editor's note: Zhang Fan, PhD, is an associate professor of Astronomy at Beijing Normal University, where he serves as deputy director of the Gravitational Wave and Cosmology Laboratory. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

Three Chinese astronauts on the Shenzhou-12 manned spacecraft just landed in northern China, marking a successful conclusion to their three-month mission in space.

During the flight, the astronauts and the ground crew impressed the world with their engineering professionalism and attention to details. Take their spacewalk as an example. During the previous spacewalk mission, the residual air pressure in the airlock made it a little difficult for astronauts to exit and conduct extravehicular activities. But no such thing happened this time.

Their mission was to assemble, test out and verify several key components of the Tianhe (Heavenly Harmony) core module that could serve as the command center for China's future Tiangong (Heavenly Palace) space station, onto which further lab modules Wentian (Questions to the Heavens) and Mengtian (Dreaming of the Heavens) will be docked.

Here, this indicates possibility, since the Tianhe in orbit is only a test module. Its sibling on the ground is ready for further adjustments, should the astronauts detect any potential faults. Once the faults are cleared, the improved module will be launched and become the core of the Tiangong space station.

The Tianhe in orbit is highly likely to become the official core module of the current Tiangong space station, while the backup will dock with it in orbit and serve as the core module of the expanded space station later.

Interestingly, the modular design of the station means further cores can be connected to previous ones, and with every core module carrying two additional lab modules on both sides, a long centipede-like space station can be formed."

Editor's note: M. Alam Brohi is a former member of the foreign service of Pakistan who retired after serving seven years as Ambassador to the Kyrgyz Republic and the Islamic Republic of Sudan. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily those of CGTN.

The U.S. is devising policies to contain the political, economic and strategic ascendancy of China. It seems this containment will be the central plank of U.S. foreign and security policy in the coming years. This competition and confrontation between the two countries, though short of a new Cold War, will keep many regional states on tenterhooks. The U.S. government is trapped domestically and internationally in their China-obsessed politics stemming from their weakening capacity to oversee world matters.

The reckless U.S. involvement in military excursions in far-off lands since World War II has resulted in countless deaths and spending of dollars. It has also left these places in utter humiliation and damaged its image of a dependable world leader. Direct U.S. military interventions and proxy wars in regions ranging from Latin America to Africa, and the Middle East to Southeast Asia, have left bitter legacies including political anarchy, intractable hostilities, militancy and terrorism.

Meanwhile, over the past four decades, China has been busy strengthening its political, economic and strategic position at the regional and global levels in ways that align with its national blueprint embedded in peace, stability, good neighborliness and economic development.

However, the economic and military rise of a regional state, in political and strategic terms, is deemed a threat to the world hegemon. This is how the U.S. government perceives China.

China has concentrated on realizing its economic potential, putting its political, ideological and territorial issues with other countries on the backburner and adopting a policy of patience and restraint in international affairs. This policy stemmed from the late Chinese statesman Deng Xiaoping's economic reforms starting in 1978 and continuing with more liberal economic plans under successive leaders. Within a decade or so, the world started witnessing the dividends of this focused economic development. China became the second largest economy by nominal GDP in 2010, and already overtook the U.S. in terms of purchasing power parity in 2020.

Following its economic development, China has become the top trading partner of East Asian countries and signed regional economic deals that include free trade agreements with Australia, Singapore, South Korea, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and others. China's trade with Africa and Latin America also leapfrogged, the former of which grew from only around $10 billion in 2000 to $220 billion in 2014. Between 2000 and 2014, Chinese financing to Africa peaked at $122 billion, dwarfing the U.S. amount of $106.7 billion.

The past few years have witnessed China building institutional infrastructure to share its affluence with other countries. In 2014, China, in collaboration with other BRICS countries, created the $100 billion New Development Bank, and the following year, set up the $100 billion Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, which 103 countries have since joined."
China's new multilateralism flame in vaccine cooperation,"Editor's note: Ikenna Emewu is a journalist and editor-in-chief of Africa China Economy Magazine, Nigeria. His primary research interests are China's international relations and ""socialism with Chinese characteristics."" The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

Even though it never slacked on this obligation in the past, China has been promoting the multilateralism diplomacy even more this year.

The imperative of this objective has became more urgent since the world got confronted with the daunting challenge of surmounting the coronavirus.

The COVID-19 onslaught came at the peak of the U.S. Trumpian days of insular and isolationist diplomacy. Former U.S. President Donald Trump persuaded a German pharmaceutical company to produce new COVID-19 vaccines only for use by the U.S. And this was just one of the many examples of his isolationist diplomacy.

On the contrary, China, the second largest economy in the world, has followed a different path that encompasses and takes the whole world along in the fight against the pandemic.

The latest move in the second week of September was the start of construction on a COVID-19 vaccine plant in Serbia, the first in Europe, turning the tide and moving the project faster to ensuring that the world truly and quickly heals from the menace.

The foundation stone laying for the factory in Belgrade further showed China's determination to aid the world with COVID-19 vaccines and make it easier for countries to better and faster achieve herd immunity.

Prior to this, China concluded in May plans for similar cooperation with Egypt, Brazil, Mexico, Turkey, Pakistan, Indonesia and the UAE. That is a global reach on all the continents with the exception of Oceania.

There exists a sure-footed diplomatic move that wears a human face, unlike the deterministic approach of some powerful countries who find it difficult to carry along the rest of the world.

The approach makes China stand out as exceptional among countries that developed vaccines against the pandemic, including India, the U.S and the UK.

At the foundation stone laying event, Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic expressed pride and appreciation that his country in liaison with partners from China and the UAE, was ""trying and seems to be able to solve some global problems.""

From April 2022, when it is meant to come on line, the factory is projected to roll out 30 million doses annually, a volume that is billed to cater to the vaccine needs of several countries in the region with the Chinese-developed Sinopharm vaccine."

Editor's note: Radhika Desai is a professor of political studies at the University of Manitoba in Canada. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

The United Nations, the most inclusive multilateral institution of world governance ever created, where each country has a vote, could not celebrate its 75th anniversary properly last year. It had to do so virtually. Worse, it was also clear that the letter and spirit of its original multilateralism had been deeply compromised.

The United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) recognized that the pandemic, the ecological emergency, the still great need for development, rising waves of desperate migration and many other world problems were crying out for cooperation and multilateralism. It highlighted the theme ""The Future We Want, the UN We Need: Reaffirming our Collective Commitment to Multilateralism.""

However, the U.S. could not care less. Just months before, former U.S. President Donald Trump had ratcheted up Barack Obama's hostile ""pivot to Asia"" into a new Cold War towards China in response to its technological development and reaction to the pandemic. At the UNGA, Trump shrilly repeated allegations about the ""Wuhan Virus"" and the ""Kung Flu"" with no proof.

Many expected President Joe Biden to be different at the 76th General Assembly and underline that ""America is back"" in the multilateral game. They hoped this will consign the cantankerous Trump years to the proverbial dustbin of history and inaugurate a new age of multilateral cooperation at the UN.

However, while history may have a dustbin for superficial contingencies, there is none for deeper developments. It is their working that explains why, on the most important matters, whether it is China or foreign policy, economic policy or even pandemic policy, President Biden, though elected to be the anti-Trump president, has found it hard to move out the ruts the Trump administration had made.

The ""America is back"" show had hardly opened when it crashed on the shoals of the Alaska Summit, the continuing trade, technology and military belligerence against China, the slowing vaccination drive and the slowing recovery threatened by the potential of Federal Reserve interest rate increases. Will Biden's address to the 76th General Assembly be different? Will it be credible if it does?

It would indeed be very surprising if it did. The pattern of U.S. foreign policy of unilateralism and exceptionalism is even more deeply entrenched in U.S. history from its beginnings than the other aspects of the much-maligned Trump policies that Biden has followed."
A positive momentum in China-Singapore ties,"Editor's note: Bobby Naderi is a London-based journalist, guest contributor in print, radio and television, and documentary filmmaker. The article reflects the author's opinions, and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

It is now a telling yarn that the United States is more than willing to divide and rule Southeast Asian nations as part of its strategy to counter China.

The Biden administration recently deployed Vice President Kamala Harris and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin to Southeast Asia to do just that. Both officials visited Singapore and delivered hawkish speeches seeking allies in the region against Beijing.

As is customary, they used the visit to highlight their self-defined success and role in preserving the rules-based world order and treaties, ways to face down China and to undercut the roles of others through short-termism and closure.

The only problem is that Singapore does not seem interested in taking sides between the two powers - just like many other nations in the strategic region. To substantiate, on September 14, when Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong met with Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi, he vowed to continue to work with Beijing, touting the cooperative relationship between the two neighbors.

In a Facebook post, Lee wrote, ""Singapore welcomes China's continued contribution in our part of the world, and will continue working with China to build a more harmonious and peaceful world.""

In a sense, Singapore, like many other nations, is determined to continue working with China to build a more harmonious and peaceful region for everyone. These nations don't trust or see the U.S. as a trustworthy partner. In their eyes, the U.S. is hyper-focused on Southeast Asia and the Indo-Pacific region as a region for influence, not as a region that needs peace and cooperation. No, the U.S. is not fixated on environmental protection, maritime sovereignty, and safety either.

Not surprisingly, the entire spectacle has been tiresome and unproductive for the U.S. as a consequence. On the other hand, Lee Hsien Loong and other officials from the region have been lauded for their courage and effort to highlight China's ongoing success in preserving the rules-based international order, regional treaties and agreements, as well as ways to face down the U.S. and its go-it-alone approach and short-termism through multilateralism and regional cooperation.

With the weakening of the economy and pillars on which so much of America's paramount power rested, China and Singapore have a lot to gain from each other. This includes advancing cooperation with China on Singapore's government projects and exploring new areas of cooperation such as the digital economy and infrastructure."
"Frequently pushing on Taiwan, Biden devoid of a strategy","Editor's note: Alessandro Golombiewski Teixeira is a national thousand talent distinguished professor of public policy at the School of Public Policy and Management, Tsinghua University, and a professor of international business at Schwarzman College in Tsinghua. He is a former special economic advisor to the president of Brazil and former Brazilian minister of tourism, and minister of development, industry and foreign trade. He was also president of the World Investment Association ¨C WAIPA. The article reflects the author's views, not necessarily those of CGTN.

Under the ""one-China policy,"" the United States severed diplomatic relations with Taiwan and recognized it as a part of the People's Republic of China. Nevertheless, the U.S. government has always used the Taiwan issue from time to time to carry out anti-China activities and to contain China's rise.

The Biden administration has frequently pushed on Taiwan to provoke China this year, demonstrating its own presence and confirming its hegemonic status. In fact, such actions on the Taiwan issue make U.S. President Joe Biden look like ""the poor donkey at its wit's end"" in the Chinese fable.

The recent event connected with Lithuania is a good example. On September 13, U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan spoke with Lithuanian Prime Minister Ingrida ?imonyt? by phone and declared his firm support for Lithuania's response to ""coercive behavior"" from China.

The White House issued a statement saying that Sullivan discussed strengthening economic, diplomatic and defense cooperation between the two countries during his call with ?imonyt?. Sullivan is the third senior U.S. official to publicly ""back"" Lithuania, all claiming to stand with Lithuania against ""Chinese coercion.""

On the outside wall of Vilnius City Hall, the capital of Lithuania, there is a quote from former U.S. President George W. Bush Jr., saying, ""Anyone who would choose Lithuania as an enemy has also made an enemy of the United States of America."" Due to complex historical and political factors, Lithuania, a former Soviet state, has been following a ""pro-American"" line, insisting on anti-Russia and going further and further down the road of anti-China. However, Lithuania's own serious socio-economic problems have not been solved but have a tendency to worsen.

Egidijus Meil¨±nas, Lithuanian Deputy Foreign Minister, whose work includes economic and diplomatic affairs, called on the U.S. to expand access to the U.S. market for Lithuanian products, and Lithuania looks forward to providing new investment opportunities for the U.S. side.

However, regardless of the current ability of the United States to help Lithuania prosper economically, the United States will not be willing to provide any substantial help to Lithuania. After all, for the United States, Lithuania is just an insignificant political pawn. Although Lithuania's submission to the U.S. has attracted its attention in the short term, the U.S. government will still focus on the Indo-Pacific region, trying to stabilize Russia to strengthen strategic competition with China."
"U.S. academics show a spine, support their Chinese colleagues","Editor's note: Anthony Moretti is an associate professor in the Department of Communication and Organizational Leadership of Robert Morris University. The article reflects the author's views and not necessarily those of CGTN.

Now and then, the right thing happens, even if a bit too late. One such example took place a few days ago when a group of U.S. professors at Stanford University made a demand of the Joe Biden administration: End the terribly unfair and perhaps even illegal targeting of Chinese scholars working in the United States.

The disgraced Donald Trump administration launched the program called the ""China Initiative"" in 2018. The Department of Justice defended the initiative, stating it was a ""strategic priority of countering Chinese national security threats and reinforces the president's overall national security strategy.""

That was nonsense then. It remains nonsense now.

If there were one word to describe Donald Trump's opinion of China during his presidency, it would be envy. Trump could not tolerate the rapid advancements China was making on the global stage; in his warped view of the world, America came first, last and everywhere in between on the greatness scale. No country - especially one from Asia - was going to threaten that.

Therefore, and like so many ideas that sprung from his mind, the initiative was intentionally hostile to China, and more specifically its scholars. Keep in mind that many of these researchers are involved in complex, multi-year projects in the United States that will eventually have benefits for more than just one country.

Sadly, Trump could not understand that, and he took advantage of the notable anti-China hysteria existing in Congress and throughout the United States in pushing his agenda. Few people spoke out against the ""China Initiative,"" and those voices were drowned out by the political elite often working hand in glove with select anti-China news organizations.

Put another way, when Chinese researchers and professors working in the United States became one of Trump's favorite targets, voices of dissent were not regularly heard in mainstream media discourse. (Chinese students in the U.S. also were swept up in Trump's illogical thinking.)

Trump was convinced these scholars had sought to work at U.S. colleges and universities simply because they wanted to steal the ideas, plans or creations of their American colleagues.

Quickly, the administration sought to arrest and charge these Chinese scholars with a host of trumped-up accusations.

One high-profile case is now over, and Trump most certainly would not approve of how it ended."

Editor's note: Stephen Ndegwa is a Nairobi-based communication expert, lecturer-scholar at the United States International University-Africa, author and international affairs columnist. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

One of the worst outcomes arising from the coordinated September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in the United States by al-Qaeda was the further polarization of a world that was eventually healing from the Cold War. Not to lose such an opportunity, the U.S. played the Biblical Moses on Mount Sinai, dividing the world between those who supported it in the war on terror on the one hand and those who were against it on the other. There was no neutral ground.

The emerging dichotomy was epitomized by then U.S. President George W. Bush in his State of the Union address on January 29, 2002, when he coined the phrase ""axis of evil"" to describe countries that allegedly sponsored terrorism. These included isolating Iran, Iraq and DPRK as common enemies of the U.S.

Recently, the U.S. has escalated its war against China by crystallizing the so-called Quad alliance. Mooted as the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue following the devastating 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, which claimed an estimated 230,000 lives and billions of dollars in damages, the four-country informal grouping comprises the U.S., Japan, India and Australia.

At the invitation of U.S. President Joe Biden on Monday, an in-person summit of this Indo-Pacific anti-China brotherhood will take place at the White House on September 24, the second after the first meeting in March was held virtually amid coronavirus concerns. The timing of the meeting is rather mischievous, taking place alongside the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) in New York, which also started on Monday.

Of course, this is not a coincidence. Biden could be trying to legitimize his Quad baby to UNGA members. But it will be a hard sell for its obvious malicious, if not diabolical, agenda. The group is inimical to the interests of the global community due to its potential for inciting a geopolitical crisis that can revive the long-forgotten Cold War mentality.

To give impetus to the inimical Quad alliance, on September 15, Biden unveiled another front against China comprising Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States (AUKUS). According to the U.S., the tripartite group was formed, like Quad, ""to deepen diplomatic, security, and defense cooperation in the Indo-Pacific region,"" which is a euphemism for countering China's influence in the area.

The White House statement spells out a variety of interventions against China in the region ranging from military and trade to science and technology. Shockingly, the U.S. talks about arming Australia with nuclear-powered submarines, which leaves little to the imagination about what the U.S. sees as a confrontation with China in the region."

Editor's note: The U.S. invasion of Afghanistan 20 years ago has cast a shadow on the country. While it has now withdrawn from the country, the pain and chaos it had caused have not faded away. This is just one of the many examples of the damages the American war machine has inflicted upon other countries.To gain a deeper understanding of the situation, CGTN compiled a list of viewpoints from our commentators. The article reflects the authors' opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

The U.S. has caused tragedies in many countries with its usual way of warmongering under the guise of ""defending democracy."" These wars resulted in numerous deaths and relentless chaos in local society. The environmental cost of the wars is also an element to be reckoned with. While wreaking havoc across the globe, the military-industrial complex in America has profited enormously from the war industry, which speaks volumes about the U.S.'s hypocrisy.

Chaos and tragedies in Afghanistan

Although the U.S. tried to whitewash its crimes in Afghanistan, its quick and irresponsible withdrawal tells another story.

""The West is fully responsible for what happened, both directly in terms of the chaos that followed its ongoing irresponsible withdrawal from Afghanistan, as well as indirectly due to what it did to foster the rise of ISIL in the first place,"" said Andrew Korybko, a Moscow-based American political analyst.

Bobby Naderi, a London-based journalist, guest contributor in print, radio and television and documentary filmmaker, gives a whole picture of the tragedy.

""Thanks to America's chest-beating jingoism, millions are still displaced throughout the volatile region, with many forced to cross the Mediterranean Sea, the cemetery of refugees, in search of safety in Europe. Countless Afghans, Syrians and victims in other countries, who have to walk for months and sleep rough on station platforms or along a roadside, are still tear-gassed and beaten at borders or crammed into trains and lorries to make their way to Europe.¡±

With all the pain America has inflicted on Afghanistan, will it start to reflect on its behavior and put a lock on Pandora's box in the future? It seems not. According to Anthony Moretti, associate professor at Robert Morris University, ""One bitter reality remains for the Iraqis and Afghans: No U.S. president or military leader will be prosecuted for the staggering death toll they are responsible for in those countries.¡±

What's more, Washington is implementing an embargo against talking over the tragedy, and its media is complying with the order. With limited access to foreign media, the unfounded rumors on social media and the embargo within their own country, the American people will become less aware of the tragedies Afghanistan has suffered."
COVID-19 and poverty: Will the world ever recover?,"The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has plagued the global economy with unprecedented challenges. The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted socioeconomic activities around the world; this abrupt change has had a pernicious footprint on supply chains, public health, jobs, food systems and several other related sectors worldwide. While millions of lives have been lost, many jobs have also been decimated, mainly because a large proportion of businesses, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) have been exposed to existential threat, which has thrust millions of people into poverty. The current alteration of the global economy is devastating, as the COVID-19 pandemic is effectively wiping out many years of progress attained in the fight against poverty.

Editor's note: Alexander Ayertey Odonkor is an economic consultant, chartered financial analyst and chartered economist with an in-depth understanding of the economic landscape of countries in Asia and Africa. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

A recent World Bank report (2020) indicates that extreme poverty, which had been declining steadily for close to 25 years, exhibited a regressing trend for the first time in 2020; more than 100 million people were estimated to fall into extreme poverty in 2020 alone while an additional 23 million to 35 million are expected to be pushed into poverty by the end of 2021, bringing the potential tally of new people living in extreme poverty to 150 million.

Even though through concerted efforts from governments, development organizations and relevant stakeholders, extreme poverty, which is one of the targets of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs), has been dwindling for almost a quarter of a century, the disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic is exacerbating the impact of climate change and armed conflict, which are the two major factors that are constraining efforts to alleviate global poverty.

Furthermore, while newly collected data suggest that the already-poor households and vulnerable people are suffering the most from COVID-19-related job losses and deprivation around the globe, the pandemic is also altering the demographic profile of global poverty by creating millions of a new type of poor people. While this new group of poor people is mostly located in urban areas, they are better educated and less likely to work in the agriculture sector as compared to the people who were living in poverty before the outbreak of COVID-19; this group of new poor are more likely to work in the informal sector.

Taking specific policy measures to lift the already-poor and the new group of poor people from extreme poverty will be a step in the right direction to reverse the retrogressing trend of global poverty. However, providing a panacea to COVID-19 alone in an effort to eliminate extreme poverty will not suffice. The most sustainable solution is to rely on a twin-track approach that focuses distinctively on addressing the pandemic and conflict in the short-term alongside pursuing long-term climate-resilient development goals.

Practically, implementing this two-track model effectively could be daunting. However, it is the surest way to bolster inclusive economic growth and promote shared prosperity, which is vital in the fight against poverty. To effectively ameliorate extreme poverty, it is imperative for policymakers and relevant stakeholders around the world, specifically those in developing countries, to draw lessons from countries that have been successful in carrying out this approach.

This modus operandi is not to discourage evidence-based policymaking in developing countries and promote copy and paste policymaking but rather it should be seen as a window of opportunity to gain additional insight that could augment domestic efforts to design and implement programs that will provide long-lasting solution to COVID-19, climate change and conflict, which will eventually alleviate poverty. While there are not many countries to learn from in this area, China's performance in recent times has been outstanding.

Undoubtedly, China's impressive accomplishment in eradicating extreme poverty should be a key reference point in the twin-track approach for developing countries."
Australia submarine row shows that Europe can't trust the U.S.,"Editor's note: CGTN's First Voice provides instant commentary on breaking stories. The daily column clarifies emerging issues and better defines the news agenda, offering a Chinese perspective on the latest global events.

The leaders of the UK, U.S. and Australia announced a ""technology-sharing deal"" on Wednesday that would see the three countries come together on research and development to counter China. The most publicized part of the deal was that the United States would now share its nuclear submarine technology with Australia, leading Canberra to jettison a $90 billion order it had placed with France.

This provoked outrage from Paris, which said the betrayal ""only reinforces the need to make the issue of European strategic autonomy loud and clear"" ¨C in other words, to be less dependent upon the United States as a partner.

France, and by extension Europe, cannot trust the United States as an ally or partner. ""America First"" was not a phase under Trump but a permanent orientation of American foreign policy whereby it has been happy to undermine, cheat and betray its partners in the pursuit of its zero-sum rendering of self-interest.

Despite Biden having frequently marketed ""America is Back!"" and pushed a charm offensive against Europe, the U.S. hastily threw France under the bus as soon as it saw the opportunity to deepen profits for its own military-industrial complex.

It was falsely assumed that with the demise of Donald Trump, the United States' self-interested approach toward Europe would come to an end and that ties would be ""renewed."" As the narrative focused so much on Trump for who he is, as opposed to American foreign policy as a general rule, European leaders placed far too much hope on Biden being different. They bought into his shoddy claims that he would support allies under the name of ""America is Back!"" and restored transatlantic solidarity.

The U.S. readily bullies Europe and has little tolerance when the bloc's interests differ from Washington's."

The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN. In a blow to established norms of non-proliferation, U.S. President Joe Biden announced a new working group with America's traditional allies ¨C the United Kingdom and Australia ¨C termed the ""allies agreement"" entailing the acquisition of nuclear-powered submarines for greater coordination in the Indo-Pacific region. Given the importance placed on de-escalation and denuclearization globally, with disproportionate attention paid to Iran's nuclear program despite its recent compliance with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), this latest agreement presents a dim reality that is not conducive to unconditional demilitarization in the region but provocative and escalatory.

While all parties to the agreement initially refrained from propping up the ""China threat"" perception, according to two American officials, the contextual framework underpinning the agreement is yet another attempt to contain China. It encompasses the trio or ""AUKUS,"" ensuring the ease of sharing information on subjects, such as artificial intelligence, long-range missiles and probable cyberattacks, which is complemented with the provision of nuclear-powered submarines. Deemed surprising by American officials, this foreign policy pivot from the Biden administration is considered an exception to America's own proclaimed standards, as it squarely targets Indo-Pacific defense priorities. With Australia, it is perhaps even more surprising. Its geographical proximity to China has meant that Canberra's decision to abandon an initial $66 billion submarine deal with France for a nuclear one from the United States is paradoxical. Note that unlike the UK or the U.S., Australia has never found it necessary to acquire nuclear weapons given the lack of palpable security threats it has encountered in the region, which both President Joe Biden and Prime Minister Scott Morrison have admitted. For the Biden administration officials pursuing Australia, it is worth remembering that in 2010, both Canberra and Washington, D.C. signed the ""123 agreement,"" which involved a promise that enrichment or reprocessing nuclear material will not be pursued. However, under the new allies' agreement in 2021, nuclear submarines are now part and parcel of the equation, which essentially equates to the Indo-Pacific nuclearization.

As an Egyptian observer, I have been studying about China for the past year ¨C its government, society, history and transformation ¨C and have talked with hundreds of Chinese and China-haters for the past three months. I have seen the great achievements of China, together with the hate and fear of some Western politicians.

China's story since the 1980s has been one of an almost divine metamorphosis. The country has ended extreme poverty, taken the lead in the world's 5G network rollout, launched three astronauts to its new space station core module, landed its Zhurong rover on Mars ¡­

China is developing. Is it a problem?

Some Western countries hate and fear the rapid development of a country that once was weak. They can't believe their 400-year-old global supremacy is being challenged. That's why, although the United States has killed millions of people and screwed several regions in the past 30 years, your television, newspapers, Google news feed and social media are all 24/7 condemning China, which has not sanctioned any country or overthrown any foreign government. None of the accusations made by Western politicians and media are backed up by evidence."

On September 13, the United Nations (UN) hosted a donor conference held in Geneva to press the international community to join hands in helping to meet Afghans' most basic needs and prevent a mass exodus from the war-torn country.

Seeking to secure $606 million in humanitarian aid for approximately 11 million people in the last four months of 2021, the UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who hosted a high-level ministerial meeting, said in his opening remarks that after decades of war and suffering, ""The people of Afghanistan need a lifeline"" during ""their most perilous hour."" Guterres also said many people in the country could run out of food by the end of September and praised the UN Humanitarian Air Service's airbridge from Pakistan's capital Islamabad to the Afghan cities of Kandahar, Mazar and Herat, concluding that ""this work must continue."" Peter Maurer, the president of the International Committee of the Red Cross, told the audience that ""primary healthcare is on the brink of collapse, water services failing and food prices exorbitant"" after recently visiting Afghanistan and seeing the situation with his own eyes. It is said that about a third of the donated money would be transferred to the UN World Food Programme (WFP), which estimates that 93 percent of the 1,600 Afghans it surveyed between August and September were not getting enough to eat. Speaking at the same event, WFP Executive Director David Beasley said 40 percent of Afghanistan's wheat crop had been lost, the cost of cooking oil had doubled, and most citizens do not have access to cash to buy food. ""Fourteen million people, one out of three, are marching to the brink of starvation. They don't know where their next meal is,"" Beasley said.

A former Fulbright scholar at Columbia University, she has a PhD in International Politics from China Foreign Affairs University. Yuan has published several papers on China-U.S. security relations in Chinese academic journals and regularly contributes to many Chinese media outlets. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

The 21st Meeting of the Council of Heads of State of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) is to be held this week in Dushanbe, Tajikistan. Given the heightened security risks in the aftermath of the U.S.-led withdrawal from Afghanistan, this meeting is much-anticipated to take on the responsibility of bringing stability and prosperity to the region.

SCO at 20

This year marks the 20 years anniversary of the September 11 terrorist attacks and the American-led war in Afghanistan. It also marks the 20 years anniversary of the founding of the SCO. The two developments were separate but correlated, which were both the result of the rising terrorist threats in the post-Cold War era.

In the hinterland of the Eurasian mass, Central Asia has long acted as the bridge between East and West where different ethnicities, religions and cultures meet and create splendid civilization. It was also the critical route along the Ancient Silk Road where trade prospered and cultural exchanges were vibrant. Due to geopolitical reasons, the region has also been haunted with the ""three evils"" of separatism, extremism and terrorism.

The SCO was founded in June 2001 on the very goal of cooperation on security matters in the region. Over the past two decades, the organization has evolved into an influential regional security forum with eight member countries including China, Russia, Tajikistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Pakistan and India, which covers 60 percent of the Eurasian continent and boasts 40 percent of the world population and 20 percent of the global GDP.

As a new type of regional partnership, the SCO is different from the confrontational-style alliances of the Western bloc. Instead, it is premised on political dialogue and consensus building for the purpose of collectively responding to common security challenges in the region. Although members harbor different interests and concerns, they share the common goal of maintaining stability and prosperity in the region. The joining of India and Pakistan as full members of SCO in 2017 and countries in the wider Central Asia and Middle East as observers and partners is an exemplar of this inclusive endeavor."
"Global Britain should profit from, not fear, China's rise","Editor's note: CGTN's First Voice provides instant commentary on breaking stories. The daily column clarifies emerging issues and better defines the news agenda, offering a Chinese perspective on the latest global events.

The new Chinese ambassador to the UK, Zheng Zeguang, has been barred from British Parliament, in an unprecedented breach of decorum.

How did relations between the UK and China sink so low that Parliament would go out of its way to gratuitously insult China's ambassador? It's worth reviewing how this vicious circle got started, who it benefits and who it harms.

Britain says its actions are in retaliation to China's sanctions on British members of Parliament.

This ignores the fact that Britain itself started this unfortunate tit-for-tat chain reaction when it joined a group of Western nations in imposing sanctions on Chinese officials in March over an alleged genocide. The March sanctions were intended to demonstrate that the world would rally together to get ""tough"" on China.

It's interesting to note that the initial ruckus about ""genocide"" in Xinjiang ahead of these sanctions has quieted, with few politicians choosing to use that word anymore.

This is because ¨C very similar to the hypothesis that COVID-19 started from a lab leak in Wuhan ¨C there is not one shred of credible evidence.

In 2021, it is quite remarkable to allege genocide could occur without any proof other than eyewitnesses provided by a group actively fighting to break Xinjiang away from China. There have been no satellite photos, mobile phone videos or any concrete evidence whatsoever of ""genocide.""

The accusation of genocide in Xinjiang is quite similar to charges that China was harvesting organs from members of a religious cult ¨C horrifying but with no evidence and no basis in fact. The organ harvesting accusations are another favorite smear of certain anti-China parliamentarians in the UK."
Rewilding and regenerating: Safeguarding the Loess Plateau ecoregion,"Editor's note: Wu Changhua is the executive director of the Professional Association for China's Environment. The article reflects the author's opinions, and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

Halting and reversing the decline of nature and enhancing climate resilience have become both an opportunity and an obligation of the Loess Plateau ecoregion in China. It also offers a living case of transition of a traditionally coal-dependent region towards a future that is people and planet positive.

Chinese President Xi Jinping's recent visit to northwestern Shaanxi Province has further highlighted the significance and the level of priority the central government assigns to driving such a transition.

Just like its name, the Loess Plateau in Chinese reflects the distinct color and landscape of a critical ecoregion in both China and Central Asia. Wind and soil, rivers and mountains, and seasonal changes, all the ecosystems' goods and services nurtured the birth and prosperity of an ancient agrarian civilization.

Such prosperity has undergone ups and downs in history, but remains and grows stronger today. Sitting at the northwest of the Yellow River Basin, it forms a transition zone between the maritime-influenced ecoregions of eastern China and the steppes and deserts of Mongolia. According to the World Wildlife Fund, the Loess soils are rich in minerals that are essential for plants, and they retain water quite well, so the region is well situated for agriculture.

While the Loess feeds a growing population and enriches diversity of both nature and culture, history has documented its rising ecological costs and escalating degeneration of nature. When most natural forest there were converted to farmlands and pastures centuries ago, a decline by a factor of eight occurred during the last three millennia. When forests were cleared, soil erosion shot up quickly. With vegetation being denuded, the soils degraded and contributed to dust storms.

Then came the industrial revolution. The Loess Plateau is geologically rich in coal and also easy to mine. The biggest reserve and producer of high-quality coal in China, the region hosts half of China's large-scale coal mines. As a consequence, the Loess has gained its reputation not only as the ""grain basket"" but also the ""boiler"" of China. Open coal mining aside, pollution of air, water and soil further wreaks havoc to an already ecologically vulnerable region.

Now, climate change adds a ""Code Red"" alarm globally. The Loess suffers with no exception. More frequent, intensified flash flooding and droughts crash the region. The infrastructure born from both industrialization and urbanization proves weak resilience. This summer's flash flooding took hundreds of lives and crippled transportation systems and the industrial supply chain.

While bearing the heavy losses and costs, the region is taking on its obligation and opportunity to transition and contribute to an urgently needed clean energy and ecological transformation. Such a transition is defined by three interconnected and mutually reinforcing legs ¨C rewilding local ecosystems, scaling down coal and upping cleaner production, and enhancing resilience."
Taking on China over Taiwan is Biden's biggest blunder yet,"Secretary of State Antony Blinken's testimony before Congress that his country ""will do whatever it takes"" to ""support Taiwan against China"" is nothing less than saber-rattling. This brinkmanship is even more bellicose when considering that he supposedly misspoke by describing the island as a ""country."" It might not have been accidental though since it's quite possible that America's top diplomat intended to send a hostile message to China.

Taking on China over Taiwan, though, is definitely Biden's biggest blunder yet and one which will doom his presidency if he doesn't soon reverse this policy. The report that his administration is considering renaming the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office (TECRO) to the ""Taiwan Representative Office"" blatantly infringes on China's territorial integrity by implying de facto U.S. government recognition of the renegade island as a separate political entity from the Chinese mainland of which it's historically been an inextricable part.

U.S. President Joe Biden's administration has been a disaster. He has failed to contain COVID-19, political polarization seems to have reached unprecedented heights due to his coercive vaccination policy that many Americans regard as infringing on their constitutional rights, the economy's supposed recovery is mostly superficial, and the U.S. just withdrew from Afghanistan in disgrace after losing control of the country to the Taliban. All this happened in only eight months.

The media is now talking more about the latest unexpected downturn in Chinese-American relations brought about by Washington's own hand than any of the other crises that the Biden administration is responsible for, which might have been the whole point all along. This political distraction is extremely dangerous though since China regards all threats to its territorial integrity as very serious matters. Symbolism such as that represented by the reported TECRO scandal and signals like Blinken's statement are part and parcel of diplomacy.

There is no ""plausible deniability"" or ""strategic ambiguity"" for the U.S. to fall back upon now. It's obvious what's going on. Biden wrongly thinks that he can bully China, not only as a convenient distraction from his cascading domestic crises, but also due to his discredited belief in America's superiority over all its peers. One would have thought that this former superpower would have been humbled by the Taliban, but instead it's now picking a fight with a country many orders of magnitude more powerful than that insurgent group.

No realistic scenario exists wherein the U.S. comes out of this brinkmanship unscathed if it does indeed go through with renaming TECRO. The potential consequences of making this kind of wrong moves would make the first eight months of Biden's disastrous presidency look mild by comparison to put it diplomatically.

There's never been a more urgent time in history for the U.S. to look inward and resolve its growing socioeconomic and political contradictions which threaten to spiral out of control if they aren't addressed as soon as possible. America's humiliating defeat by the Taliban in Afghanistan shows that it's incapable of and shouldn't be participating in what it regards as ""great power competition"" with China.

Taking on China over Taiwan isn't just Biden's biggest blunder yet, but also his most dangerous. He's guaranteed to fail, which will only make his country's many other crises much worse. The American leader is also risking global stability through his irresponsible brinkmanship over an issue halfway across the world that isn't of any objectively legitimate relevance to the U.S. national interests. Biden must realize that it's counterproductive to threaten China just to distract from domestic crises. Hopefully he wises up and doesn't have to learn a lesson.

"Iran is joining the SCO, which is good news for both","Editor's note: Djoomart Otorbaev is the former prime minister of the Kyrgyz Republic, a distinguished professor of the Belt and Road School of Beijing Normal University, and a member of Nizami Ganjavi International Center. The article reflects the author's views and not necessarily those of CGTN.

September 15 marks the 20th anniversary of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), and the SCO summit is scheduled September 16-17. Besides the events marking the anniversary, another event will be of equal importance: Iran's addition to the SCO.

On August 11, Russian Security Council Secretary Nikolai Patrushev called his Iranian counterpart Admiral Ali Shamkhani to discuss Russian-Iranian security cooperation, Afghanistan, Syria and the Persian Gulf situation. He also announced that Iran would soon join the SCO by the unanimous decision of the association's member states. On the same day, Shamkhani tweeted: ""Fortunately, political obstacles to Iran's membership in the Shanghai Agreement have been removed, and Iran's membership will be finalized through technical formalities.""

In 2001, SCO was established with six founding members. It all began in 1996 with the ""Shanghai Five"" ¨C ??Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, China, Russia and Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan soon joined it. Today the SCO has eight member states. In 2017, India and Pakistan became members of this regional body dedicated to security, economy and humanitarian cooperation. And it is likely that soon there will be nine members.

The process of Iran's accession may take some time. For example, for India and Pakistan, it took almost two years to complete their formal processes. The official launch of the procedures for Iran's accession to the SCO should be recognized as a real breakthrough since the country has spent more than 10 years waiting for full membership.

Tehran received observer status at the SCO back in 2005, after which it applied for full membership in 2008. However, until 2015, Iran could not be admitted to the organization due to the existing international sanctions.

According to SCO rules, a country under the sanctions of the United Nations Security Council cannot become its member. Those sanctions were lifted in 2015 when Tehran agreed to limit its nuclear program. But even this did not open the doors for it to the SCO.

Unexpectedly, Tajikistan blocked the Iranian application, although it had the most harmonious relations with Iran for a long time among all the SCO countries. The populations of both countries speak the same language, Persian. Dushanbe accused Tehran of supporting the Islamic Renaissance Party of Tajikistan and indirect involvement in organizing terrorist acts.

However, some time ago, the parties resolved this conflict. Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi will personally fly to Dushanbe for the summit. Moreover, this will be the first foreign trip since his election to the post in June this year."
Common prosperity: A challenge and a contribution,"Chinese President Xi Jinping learns about the progress in making comprehensive use of coal amid the circular economy at a chemical company during his inspection tour of Yulin City, northwest China's Shaanxi Province, September 13, 2021. /Xinhua

Chinese President Xi Jinping learns about the progress in making comprehensive use of coal amid the circular economy at a chemical company during his inspection tour of Yulin City, northwest China's Shaanxi Province, September 13, 2021. /Xinhua

Editor's note: Lu Xia is an associate professor at the School of Marxism Studies and a research fellow at the National Academy of Development & Strategies, Renmin University of China. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

In setting the prospect vision of the year 2035, the Fifth Plenary Session of the 19th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) last October solemnly called for ""more tangible and substantial progress in common prosperity of all the people.""

To re-emphasize the significance of the principle, the 10th meeting of the Central Committee on Finance and Economics in late August put out a systematic portfolio of policies, explicitly making common prosperity the top priority in the CPC's second centenary goal.

Chinese President Xi Jinping's inspection of Yulin City, northwest China's Shaanxi Province, in early September further highlighted the central leadership's focus on this principle in China's socioeconomic development.

As a specific category, common prosperity literally means ""to get rich altogether,"" containing the words for ""common"" (gongtong) and ""rich"" (fuyu), thus a systemic analysis of the connotations of ""common"", ""rich"", and their relationship is of great help to grasp the essence.

To get rich - the foundation for a brighter future

As a sign revealing the level of development, wealth is usually expressed in terms of GDP per capita. According to the World Bank, economies with a per capita national income of more than $12,535 are high-income economies, or rich societies. China's GDP per capita exceeded $10,000 for the first time in 2019, labeling it among ""upper-middle-income countries"". According to its current rate, during the 14th Five-Year Plan period (2021-2025), China will be ranked among high-income countries.

On the one hand, a socialist society like China must be a society with a high level of development, meaning that the level of productivity must exceed the highest level that could be (and has been) achieved under other sorts of system.

In this sense, China's pursuit of common prosperity is a big challenge and it will take a long period of unremitting efforts to achieve that goal.

On the other hand, a socialist society must be one with more efficiency of productive forces. To fulfill this point, nowadays the key is to put innovation at the core of the overall driving force, making science and technology a strategic support for development.

Yet the current situation might not be that desirable, thus only by constructing a national innovation system, speeding up self-reliance-oriented innovation, and firmly holding key technology in its own hands, can China comprehensively shape the development of new advantages in global competition and win the initiative of development.

Therefore, China's promotion of common prosperity is bound to be a long-term arduous great project. In order to promote common prosperity more effectively, it must always adhere to the principles that economic construction is the top priority, that development be high-quality, and that the cake of common prosperity be bigger and better.

Common - defining the characteristic of richness

As the Chinese leadership always puts it, poverty is not socialism, nor is socioeconomic polarization; only common prosperity takes the essence of socialism. That is to say, ""common"" defines the characteristic of development.

Common prosperity, however, refers to the wealth of all people, revealing that what China wishes to achieve is not a polarized society, not the prosperity of a small section of people and certain regions, but the prosperity of all people. To meet its end, allowing some people and some regions to get rich first is the inevitable process and a temporary means to achieve the final goal.

On the other hand, common prosperity also involves all-round prosperity, meaning that it includes not only materials such as food, clothing, housing, and transportation, but also ideological progress in segments such as culture and entertainment.

It could be argued that the common prosperity that China wishes to achieve is aiming at comprehensive affluence, just tackling the contradiction in the new era between people's desire for a better life and the inadequate development in reality.

Therefore, in the process of promoting common prosperity, China will always adhere to the people-centered principle, treating the realization of the fundamental interests of the vast majority of the people as the starting point and very basis of development."
Financing a sustainable global food system,"A villager adds scallion to tofu at a dried bean workshop in Bijie City, Guizhou Province, China, April 14, 2021. /Getty A villager adds scallion to tofu at a dried bean workshop in Bijie City, Guizhou Province, China, April 14, 2021. /Getty

Editor's note: Simon Zadek is Chair of the Finance for Biodiversity Initiative. The article reflects the author's opinion and not necessarily the views of CGTN. The global food system is unsustainable. While it is worth approximately $8 trillion annually, its negative impact is valued at roughly $12 trillion. This is not the system's only contradiction. Around the world, food systems are both affected by climate change (owing to disruptive weather and rising temperatures) and make significant contributions to it (through greenhouse-gas emissions and biodiversity destruction). The millions of jobs they provide are often low-quality and poorly paid. Most significantly, they fail in their ultimate purpose of delivering affordable, healthy food to all.

Because the global food system is fundamentally unviable, change is inevitable. But the radical reforms needed to create an inclusive, sustainable sector that produces nourishing food for the world's population may have devastating short-term consequences. If we take the wrong approach, incorporating the true costs of production into food systems could trigger widespread bankruptcy, devastate rural unemployment, drive up prices, and increase poverty. The best way to achieve a rapid, fair, and safe transition to a sustainable global food system that can deliver affordable, healthy food for all is, however, a matter of heated debate. This is reflected in the strident and largely unproductive discussions taking place in the run-up to the United Nations Food Systems Summit, to be held during the UN General Assembly this month. From a production standpoint, advocates of regenerative farming vehemently oppose a new generation of soilless food production, such as lab-grown ""alternate protein"" and vertical farming. But it is tough to scale regenerative farming rapidly. Soilless systems must be a major part of the solution, given their dramatically reduced carbon footprint and water use, minimal impact on biodiversity, and potential for rapidly delivering cheap, healthy food at scale. The role of finance in this transition is no less controversial. There is some merit to complaints about the undue influence of a limited number of private players on decisions that impact the entire global food system. Financialization ¨C the drive to maximize risk-adjusted financial returns ¨C is increasing across the global food system, and market concentration is growing. For example, just 10 companies control half of the world's seed market, and four agribusiness firms account for 90 percent of the global grain trade. Just 1 percent of agricultural firms own 65 percent of the available farmland.

Is the U.S. really prepared for a war over Taiwan?,"Editor's note: CGTN's First Voice provides instant commentary on breaking stories. The daily column clarifies emerging issues and better defines the news agenda, offering a Chinese perspective on the latest global events.

The Biden administration is seriously considering a request from China's Taiwan to change the name of its representative office in Washington from ""Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office"" to ""Taiwan Representative Office,"" according to the Financial Times report.

Taiwan is a sensitive matter in China-U.S. ties; Washington is clear about it. Knowing well the one-China principle is Beijing's bottom line, American hawks have repeatedly been playing with fire on Taiwan in a gesture to give some so-called deference to their ""friends"" in the region, just like they did in Afghanistan and Iraq.

Now, it is leaking such information to test the Chinese mainland's response.

Beijing's message to Washington is clear: Abandoning the one-China principle can trigger punitive diplomatic measures and the use of force when necessary.

Hawkish American politicians can look to Lithuania for a hint of how the Chinese mainland will respond at the diplomatic level. After Vilnius allowed the Taiwan authorities to open a ""representative office"" under the name of ""Taiwan,"" the Chinese government recalled its ambassador to Lithuania and required the Lithuanian side to recall its ambassador to China.

As the world's superpower, Washington's decision to change the name could have significant repercussions. Apart from sending a signal to Taiwan's independence forces, the move may encourage U.S. allies who thought of playing the Taiwan card but dared not anger Beijing to follow suit on the Taiwan question. This means the Chinese side will take more drastic punitive measures against Washington than Vilnius if it decides to go further to challenge China's bottom line.

It is not the first time Washington has made such petty moves regarding Taiwan. Those who play with fire will get burned sooner or later. If no measure is taken that could strike a heavy blow to Washington and deter it from further provocations, the country, at the instigation of anti-China hawks, will repeatedly hype independence in Taiwan, actively show support for its ""friends"" in the region and attempt petty moves to test the Chinese mainland's response ¨C all in an attempt to bring trouble to China."
Australia out of step,"Editor's note: Daryl Guppy is an international financial technical analysis expert and national board member of the Australia China Business Council, who has provided weekly Shanghai Index analysis for mainland Chinese media for more than a decade. He also appears regularly on CNBC Asia and is known as ""The Chart Man."" The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

""Blindsided; hung out to dry; left out on a limb; pulled the rug out from under; left in the lurch; flat-footed."" These are some of the multitude of English terms used to describe the situation where your best friend does something behind your back.

Australians can take their pick of these terms after the recent phone call between U.S. President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping, which has all the hallmarks of pirouette in policy that has caught Australia ""flat-footed."" It appears that Australian hawks have been shot down by their closest ally with White House reports saying ""The two leaders had a broad, strategic discussion in which they discussed areas where our interests converge, and areas where our interests, values, and perspectives diverge.""

""They agreed to engage on both sets of issues openly and straightforwardly. This discussion was part of the United States' ongoing effort to responsibly manage the competition between the United States and the PRC.""

The two leaders discussed the responsibility of both countries to ensure ""competition does not veer into conflict."" It's an approach consistent with Biden's nomination of career diplomat Nicholas Burns, rather than a political colleague, to serve as U.S. ambassador to China.

This more conciliatory approach stands in contrast to the bellicosity of Australian relations with China, where apparently no compromise is possible.

In April, the Australian Home Affairs Secretary Michael Pezzullo delivered a ""drums of war"" speech, and a group of government members echoed the sentiments. These comments were never disavowed by Prime Minister Scott Morrison or his colleagues. Last week Defense Minister Peter Dutton said it was important to deepen military cooperation between the U.S. and Australia in order to deter ""the most egregious forms of coercion and aggression.""

The debate in Australia is framed in terms of protection of outraged sovereignty and the relentless urging of the U.S. to reciprocate with the same bellicose language that characterized the Donald Trump years.

To be sure, Biden is no good friend of China, and he has continued and enhanced many of the policy positions adopted by Trump. However, Biden is far more of a diplomatic realist than his predecessor or Australian Prime Minister.

It's useful to have attack dogs whose yapping serves to indicate how far things could go if they were let slip. The U.S., China and Australia all have these hard-line groups, but they serve to highlight the most extreme consequences should not be reached; instead, the governments should compromise.

The key use for these noisy proponents of conflict is the way they can be disowned as they are not part of formal policy. Their yapping serves to indicate how bad things could get, but restraining these elements serves to underline the sincerity of attempts to avoid the conflict and reach agreement.

However, current Australian foreign policy doesn't seem to comprehend. By its silence in the face of its parliamentary hard right-wing, the Australian government rather lends its tacit support to this yapping.

Biden's approach is different. He has the same hard anti-China group making media noises and given platforms on the right-wing media, but he is using this to effectively say ""Look at how bad things could be if we don't reach a compromise and agreements."""

He is a contributing editor to the Black Agenda Report, co-editor of Friends of Socialist China, and founding member of the No Cold War international campaign. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

Mainstream U.S. media frequently depicts China as a ""closed off"" country that treats ethnic minorities with contempt and oppression. The New York Times took this baseless accusation further in an op-ed published on September 9 that claimed China was closing itself off from the world and rejecting the English language. No verifiable proof was offered beyond reforms to the education system that seek to address economic and social stressors faced by Chinese families.

The op-ed argued that China's decision to place tighter regulations on its private tutoring and examination process is a sign that the country is closing itself off from the world. Yet China's reforms actually achieve the opposite by adhering to the goal set out by the central government to ensure ""common prosperity"" for all. After eliminating extreme poverty last year, China has tightened regulations on tech companies and educational institutions in a bid to create an environment where citizens of lower income levels can enjoy the prosperity of the fast-growing socialist economy.

Whatever steps China takes to provide a more equitable economic landscape falls well outside of the United States' jurisdiction. The U.S. mainstream media often makes China's sovereignty an American concern, due to the media's deep ties with the military industrial complex and the political establishment in Washington. A negative story about China is released in major U.S. media on a near daily basis.

Media complicity in a U.S.-led new Cold War has led to a steep dip in American public opinion toward China. Anti-Asian racism has become a more severe problem in the United States in large part because of the collusion between the U.S. political establishment and mainstream media in promoting the racist fabrication that China was responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic.

Yet China was able to effectively implement a coordinated and centralized response to COVID-19 that preserved the lives of countless numbers of people. China was also the first major economy to achieve positive economic growth amid the myriad of problems that the pandemic presented to development. The fact that China was able to complete its goal of eliminating extreme poverty during a global public health crisis demonstrates that the country's commitment to common prosperity is very real."
Biden administration must end 'China Initiative',"Editor's note: Bradley Blankenship is a Prague-based American journalist, political analyst and freelance reporter. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily those of CGTN.

A group of 177 Stanford University faculty members recently penned an open letter to U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland, requesting an end to the Department of Justice's ""China Initiative.""

The program is a legacy of the administration of former President Donald Trump, who implemented it in order to counter alleged economic espionage, intellectual property theft and other possible threats from the Chinese government.

However, at a time when people of Asian descent in the U.S. are already experiencing a surge in hate crime, the initiative has only raised further concerns about racial profiling, deviating from its basis on national security ¨C and, as the Stanford academics noted, it's also bad for the country's competitiveness.

According to an FBI report published in 2020, hate crimes in the U.S. are at its highest level in 12 years ¨C and crimes against Asians increased significantly. Besides, the advocacy group Stop AAPI Hate said that it received 9,081 reports of hate incidents directed at Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders from March 19, 2020 to June 30, 2021.

Last year, the UN also took note of this issue and released a report on these ""racist attacks and other xenophobic incidents¡­ as well as alleged lack of measures by the U.S. authorities to effectively combat such incidents.""

Responding to this problem, U.S. Congress in April passed the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act, a bill designed to address an uptick in hate crimes against Asian people."
Macao legislative election: What is public support for ruling parties?,"Counting ballots after a voting for the election of the seventh Legislative Assembly of the Macao SAR at a polling station in Macao, south China, September 12, 2021. /Xinhua Counting ballots after a voting for the election of the seventh Legislative Assembly of the Macao SAR at a polling station in Macao, south China, September 12, 2021. /Xinhua

Editor's note: Timothy Kerswell is a research fellow at the Chinese University of Hong Kong (Shenzhen). He lived in Macao for seven years, working as an assistant professor at the University of Macao. The article reflects the author's opinion and not necessarily the views of CGTN. China's Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR) held its legislative election last weekend to decide who will take part in the Legislative Assembly for the next four years. I lived in Macao for seven years and witnessed two elections, and one of the things to be noticed in Macao is that the ""pan-establishment"" group of parties which have been a majority in the Legislative Assembly since Macao's return to China have maintained consistently high levels of support. The 2009 election represented the high water mark for the pan-democratic forces, and even then they only had four candidates elected out of what was then a total of 29.

One of the more over-hyped areas of discussion regarding the Macao election was the disqualification of 21 candidates for various violations of the electoral commission criteria. This has been laughably interpreted in some diplomatic and media circles as some kind of arbitrary crackdown. However, this is one of those cases where certain political forces love arguing for the ""rule of law"" until a law applies which they don't like. It's actually really difficult to get yourself disqualified by the Macao Electoral Affairs Commission. The criteria are very narrow, and include only: refusing to uphold the Basic Law which structures the entire Legislative Assembly, acts against the sovereignty of China and the Macao SAR, violation of the 2009 national security law, and receiving funding and training from outside forces whose objectives compromise the sovereignty of China or Macao SAR. Widespread media reports suggested this decision was the reason for a lower election turnout in Macao, which declined by roughly 15 percent. There's some fairly obvious, but less politically expedient, explanations for the decline. The very obvious one is the COVID-19 pandemic. Macao doesn't have a postal voting mechanism, which means voters have to be both physically present in Macao and willing to come out on election day to mass public venues. A large number of Macao residents live outside Macao, and under the current circumstances it's very inconvenient to return. Additionally, Macao has only just finished dealing with a recent COVID-19 resurgence, which is obviously a major part as to why many people chose to stay home. The second reason why the electoral disqualifications are an overrated factor in explaining the lower turnout is that the pan-democrats remained part of the election. The Nova Esperanca (NE) list headed by Jose Maria Coutinho, part of the pan-democratic camp, was not found to violate the electoral rules and was not disqualified. This list made modest gains compared to the previous election, picking up two seats instead of its previous one, most likely because some previous pan-democratic voters transferred their vote to the NE list, but their total number of votes was just above 14,000, nowhere near 15 percent of Macao's eligible voters. If democracy, as defined by the pan-democratic camp, was what this election was about, we would expect a much larger share of the roughly 15 percent of new non-voters to instead be pouring their votes for the remaining pan-democratic party, but this just didn't happen. So, instead of complaining about the decisions of the electoral commission, perhaps a more valid question to ask is why the pro-establishment camp retains the broad support, which it has maintained since the inception of the Macao SAR.

The reality of climate financial risk,"Editor's note: Karl Schmedders is Professor of Finance at the Institute for Management Development. Rick van der Ploeg is Professor of Economics and Research Director of the Oxford Centre for the Analysis of Resource-Rich Economies at the University of Oxford. The article reflects the authors' views and not necessarily those of CGTN.

In a recent commentary, John H. Cochrane, a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution, argues that ""climate financial risk"" is a fallacy. His eye-catching premise is that climate change doesn't pose a threat to the global financial system, because it ¨C and the phase-out of fossil fuels that is needed to address it ¨C are developments that everyone already knows are underway. He sees climate-related financial regulation as a Trojan horse for an otherwise unpopular political agenda.

We disagree. For starters, one should acknowledge the context in which regulation emerges. With respect to climate policy, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has set the stage with its sixth assessment report, which concludes with a high degree of certainty that the Earth's climate is changing, and that human activities are the cause. Ecologist William Ripple, the co-author of another recent study of planetary ""vital signs,"" goes further: ""There is growing evidence we are getting close to or have already gone beyond tipping points associated with important parts of the Earth system.""

Unlike the 2008 global financial crisis ¨C when banks that took excessive risks were bailed out, and global financial regulation was overhauled in light of our new understanding about interdependent financial markets ¨C unmitigated climate change will lead to a crisis with irreversible outcomes.

The question, as Cochrane puts it, is whether climate-related financial regulation can do anything to help us avoid such outcomes. Although the answer is complex and currently incomplete, we would argue that it can. Financial regulation to mitigate climate risk is indeed worth pursuing, because the stakes are too high to let the perfect become the enemy of the good.

Consider some of the arguments about systemic financial risk and extreme climate events. First, we are told that the risk of ""stranded assets"" ¨C particularly fossil-fuel assets ¨C will become a fact of life, to be borne only by investors. Here, Cochrane points out, correctly, that fossil-fuel investments have always been risky. But can we reasonably say that the prevalence of this energy source should be left to market players alone, or that only investors will bear the costs?

Though per capita fossil-fuel consumption in countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom has declined since 1990, total consumption has grown dramatically elsewhere, rising by 50 percent globally over the last 40 years. In 2020, China and India were the planet's two largest coal-energy producers, relying on coal for 61 percent and 71 percent of their electricity, respectively. Their economies, and those of many other developing countries, simply would not sustain a precipitous reduction in fossil-fuel energy.

Cochrane also suggests that there is no scientifically validated possibility that extreme climate events will cause systemic financial crises over the next decade, and that regulators are therefore stymied from assessing the risks on financial institutions' balance sheets over a five- or ten-year horizon. But the sheer scale of the challenge should make us reconsider the temporal dimensions of regulation.

If temperature increases are to be kept within 2¡ã Celsius of pre-industrial levels this century, about 80 percent of all coal, one-third of all oil, and half of all gas reserves must be left unburned. All of the Arctic's oil and the remainder of Canada's oil sands ¨C the world's largest deposit of crude oil ¨C must be left in the ground, starting almost immediately."

Editor's note: Anthony Moretti is an associate professor in the Department of Communication and Organizational Leadership of Robert Morris University. The article reflects the author's views and not necessarily those of CGTN.

Last Saturday, the United States recognized the 20th anniversary of one of its saddest days, the 9/11 attacks that killed almost 3,000 people in New York, Pennsylvania and Washington, D.C.

President Joe Biden was joined by two of his predecessors, George W. Bush and Barack Obama, in reminding Americans of the importance of honoring the dead while not forgetting what caused that horrible day.

We know what followed those attacks. Bush started wars in Iraq, ostensibly to remove Saddam Hussein because of (non-existent) weapons of mass destruction; and Afghanistan, principally to root the Taliban from power. Bush and Obama waffled time and again on when was the right time to completely and permanently remove the troops from both nations. Trump then waited until the embers of the dumpster fire that was his presidency were dying out before he ultimately agreed to a plan to end the war in Afghanistan.

That war lasted 20 years and cost over $2 trillion, but it cost far more. The last American troops finally left Afghanistan at the end of August. Remarkably, roughly 2,500 U.S. military personnel remain in Iraq, where Bush's belief that a functioning and legitimate democracy could be established in a country that had never experienced it remains one of the worst gaffes in American history. The U.S. presidents never ended America's highly controversial presence in Iraq, although Biden says combat troops will leave by the end of the calendar year.

The human toll from retaining a military presence in Iraq for 20 years is staggering: Brown University estimates that between 184,382 and 207,156 Iraqi citizens ""have died from direct war related violence caused by the U.S., its allies, the Iraqi military and police, and opposition forces from the time of the invasion through October 2019."" The university also estimates that more than 4,500 U.S. soldiers, 3,500 U.S. contractors and around 50,000 Iraqi military and police died because of the U.S.-orchestrated invasion."

In the years ahead, the U.S.' containment of China is expected to tighten with the rise of new tensions and pressures. The spotlight on China is now set following the U.S. forces' pullout from Afghanistan after 20 years of a futile war that left thousands of civilians dead and the country's economy in shambles. The withdrawal signals Biden government's pivot to Asia where China has emerged as a regional power in a bid, so Washington says repeatedly, to dislodge American presence.

To secure the generous allocations, the industry spends millions on lobbying Congress. For instance, the 20-year Afghan war saw the industry spend $2.5 billion in lobbying apart from $285 million to lawmakers' campaign coffers. Furthermore, one-third of the Senate Defense Subcommittee on Appropriations members own stocks in top defense contractors. For the defense budget, this subcommittee specifies weapons systems and other goods for the Pentagon to purchase from private contractors. This public-private collaboration is buoyed by lucrative jobs in the defense industry that awaits legislators and Pentagon and military officials upon retirement.

Binding these interest groups is common greed to increase defense expenditures by identifying and intensifying conflict zones in the world so as to attract domestic and international support. According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, the U.S. hosts five of the world's 10 largest defense contractors - Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, General Dynamics, Boeing and Northrop Grumman- accounting for 57 percent of the total global arms sales. The lifeline of the arms manufacturers is the yearly defense budget ¨C over $700 billion today ¨C a big chunk of which is siphoned off by the weapons industry. The firms' revenues climbed by a quantum leap since 9/11: $7.35 trillion, the Defense News reveals.

The shift is actually not new as the U.S. pivot to Asia took roots in 2011 under Barack Obama. Obama's successor, Donald Trump, pointed to China as a ""global security threat."" Articulated by Trump and now Biden, the tag was contrived by America's shadowy war machine ¨C the Military-Industrial Complex (MIC). This powerful elite, also known today as Military-Industrial-Congressional Complex (MICC), is where the interests of weapons manufacture, key congressional leaders and the apparatus of the state and defense departments intersect.

Traditionally, the defense industry influences appointments in the executive branch. To illustrate, Biden's state secretary, Antony Blinken, co-founded WestExec Advisors, which ""provides strategic insight on the U.S. and allied national security needs and emerging opportunities."" In a state of war, the state department nuances foreign policy toward increased militarization like approving weapons sales. A hawkish state department like Blinken's is a boon to the MICC.

Before his appointment to the defense portfolio, General Lloyd Austin served on the board of Raytheon, which was merged with United Technologies in April. According to AEI.org, Raytheon and United Technologies were the No. 4 and No. 6 defense contractors in 2019, combining for $24.7 billion in military contracts. Since 2016, Austin was paid $1.4 million by the two companies.

The newly nominated U.S. ambassador to China, Nicholas Burns, served as a Senior Counselor at The Cohen Group, a consulting firm whose Aerospace and Defense assists top aerospace and weapons manufacturers in securing tens of billions in defense deals with the defense department and foreign governments. Burns was also on the board of directors at the Atlantic Council, a think tank that has received funding from five leading arms makers.

For decades, the defense industry's penetration into the executive and legislative bodies helped shape legislative actions, policy decisions as well as strategies that bolster arms contractors' interests. For instance, George W. Bush's ""war on terror"" after 9/11 earmarked $8 trillion to bankroll operations against targets in Afghanistan, Iraq and other countries suspected to be hotbeds of terrorism. In Obama's ""pivot to Asia"" policy, Southeast Asia was targeted for bigger arms sales. By the end of 2011, U.S. arms traders amassed $46 billion of military sales worldwide, doubling the 2010 figures.

Under the MICCs umbrella, think tanks funded by defense contractors promote or inflate tensions in order to increase defense budgets. To cite one, the Center for Security and International Studies (CSIS) has been actively circulating strategic studies on South China Sea designed to boost U.S. maritime operations and war drills jointly with some ASEAN members. CSIS is funded by 17 contractors, including six of the world's biggest weapons makers.

Patrick M. Cronin is one security expert whose works help influence U.S. foreign policy. Cronin once served as senior director of the Institute for National Strategic Studies (INSS) at the National Defense University, where he oversaw the Center for the Study of Chinese Military Affairs. As a senior director of the Asia-Pacific Security Program at the Center for a New American Security (CNAS) in 2016, he pressed for ""more regular FONOPs and other regional exercises ¡­ in a manner that reinforces the historic 12 July Permanent Court of Arbitration ruling (while) nudging claimants to pursue arbitration and find peaceful resolutions of their disputes.""

Over the past century, fabricating ""new enemies"" and spreading fear have been the lie that justified U.S. intervention and wars in at least 70 countries, including Afghanistan. Such hoax, with the intellectual support of think tanks, has been responsible for instabilities, regime changes, and attacks on the sovereignty of independent states. In the guise of reshaping the world in America's image, a terrifying figure of human lives was lost, including 1 million civilians in the 20-year war on terror.

In the long haul, U.S. military adventurism fueled by the MICC has limits. Given the overstretched military presence of the U.S. with some 700 military bases and the debacles that accentuate military failures, it will not be long before American military power will fall just like old empires. The main driver that will bring this about are the domestic challenges facing the American system and its war-based economy ¨C a looming economic recession, massive unemployment, dysfunctional democratic institutions and a growing anti-war movement.

Wealth Management linkage boosts integration in China's capital market,"Editor's note: Matteo Giovannini is a finance professional at the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China in Beijing and a member of the China Task Force at the Italian Ministry of Economic Development. The article reflects the author's views, and not necessarily those of CGTN.

The development of a multi-faceted, modern domestic capital market has been for a long time a major goal in China's economic agenda, having been identified as a powerful source of long-term financing for those key sectors that support growth as well as a mechanism to reduce the level of dependence on overseas capital markets.

Despite being the world's second-largest financial market and the largest emerging market, China has actively introduced since 2012 multiple connectivity programs in its capital markets with the intent to meet domestic investors' request for diversification and global asset allocation and attract larger foreign participation.

In this context, it is not surprising the announcement made on September 10th at a ceremony held in Hong Kong of the official inauguration of the long-awaited Wealth Management Connect, a scheme that links the southern province of Guangdong with Hong Kong and Macao, and of the launch of the southbound Bond Connect scheme, that complement its northbound leg introduced in 2017.

The two schemes that are expected to come into operation next month are part of a wider escalation in financial pilot projects that China has recently inaugurated in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA), an ambitious plan announced in December 2016 as part of the 13th Five-Year Plan (2016-2020) and aimed at creating a single economic entity that has technological innovation and financial linkage at its core.

Recent efforts from the government to utilize the island of Hengqin in Zhuhai and the Qianhai New District in Shenzhen to promote financial integration with Macao and Hong Kong show China's long-term goal. The development of a dynamic economic region where people, capital and goods can move freely across the border and where apparent obstacles such as different jurisdictions, regulations and currencies can be overcome for the sake of regional growth and prosperity.

The announcement of new connectivity programs clearly demonstrates the high level of cooperation and alignment reached by the People's Bank of China (PBOC) and Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) in terms of mutual recognition of the respective capital markets and cross-border regulatory frameworks.

It is important to underline that the possibility to leverage the expertise gained from previous connect schemes in the equity market, through the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect and the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect, and in the debt market, via the Chinese mainland-Hong Kong Bond Connect program, could have equipped regulators with a high level of confidence due to the low level of risk in the implementation of the new linkages."
"Without diplomatic recalcitrance, is the end of JCPOA crisis possible?","Editor's note: Hamzah Rifaat Hussain, a former visiting fellow at the Stimson Center in Washington and a former assistant researcher at the Islamabad Policy Research Institute (IPRI), is a TV anchor of Indus News in Pakistan. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

The lingering crisis of the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) necessitates innovative approaches from multilateral organizations, given that American diplomacy continues to be a roadblock towards constructive engagement. Both Iran and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) have agreed upon measures to increase transparency through building trust, with United Nations (UN) inspectors now installing memory cards which will monitor Tehran's nuclear weapons program which is considered a prelude towards the eventual lifting of U.S. sanctions. Given Iran's constant browbeating by the United States with no letup in economic coercion, this agreement bodes well for the future as a concerted attempt to resuscitate the central tenets of the JCPOA deal which is needed as a rare moment of respite for a country which has borne the brunt of diplomatic recalcitrance.

The head of the IAEA Rafael Grossi struck the deal with the Ebrahim Raisi administration as constructive talks were held with the head of the Iranian atomic energy association, Mohammad Eslami. Central to the essence of this agreement are key points which make it difficult for European powers and the U.S. to table a censuring motion against Iran prior to it being passed to the United Nations Security Council (UNSC).

Firstly, on technicalities alone, this agreement with the IAEA relays trust in the Iranian apparatus given that existing cards will remain in place in respective facilities in addition to new memory cards installed. This allays concerns of the leadership over skepticism about Western motivations regarding its nuclear program.

Secondly, the process is made less intrusive and more trust oriented. Note that previous policies from respective U.S. administrations focused squarely on certainty that Iran was developing a military nuclear weapons capability while disregarding repeated calls from previous Iranian administrations that Tehran in all actuality, was developing nuclear energy for civilian purposes."
Be wary of Biden repeating Trump's trade war errors,"Editor's note: CGTN's First Voice provides instant commentary on breaking stories. The daily column clarifies emerging issues and better defines the news agenda, offering a Chinese perspective on the latest global events.

Like Donald Trump, it appears that Joe Biden's trade goal with China is not exactly ensuring fair trade between the two countries but to gain domestic political advantages.

According to the Wall Street Journal's report on September 11, the Biden administration is considering launching an investigation against China under Section 301 of the U.S. trade law, which could lead to more tariffs.

At the same time, The U.S. Trade Representative's office is said to be looking into which of the current tariffs are ""hurting the U.S. economy or could substantially raise the costs of other parts of the Biden agenda,"" in particular the ones related to Biden's infrastructure agenda.

It is said that the U.S. may cut those tariffs or grant some exclusions to them.

This cynical exercise has nothing to do with improving trade ties between the countries, and everything to do with domestic politics. There are several potential pitfalls with Biden's tactics. First of all, they rely strongly on a team approach, with the U.S. and its allies all applying economic pressure on China at the same time to meet the same goals. However, Europe and Japan both have profitable and healthy trade ties with China and may not see the point in jeopardizing them.

Both Europe and Japan have been able to manage trade differences with China mostly through negotiations. They would have little to gain and much to lose by joining the U.S. in slapping tariffs on China. The Journal makes a note of this in its report, saying the Trump administration grew frustrated with efforts to get allies to apply economic pressure on China ""in part because Germany and other nations weren't willing to put much pressure on China, a key trading partner.""

And as much as President Biden may wish otherwise, this dynamic has not changed.

The second problem with the tariff tactics under consideration is that trade wars hurt both sides. The Biden team is living in a fantasy land if it thinks it can cherry-pick tariffs that will only hurt China but help itself. But when business deals are called off because of politics, both parties lose out."
An irreparable crack in the trans-Atlantic alliance,"Editor's note: Hayat Bangash is a freelance columnist on international affairs with degrees in business administration and war studies. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

After two decades of defending American wars around the world, Europe now wants to defend its own interests. With the continent dependent on White House decisions driven by America's domestic priorities, political trust across the Atlantic is on a precipitous fall.

North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) has been the main military cover of Europe since World War II. But the U.S. has come to dominate the multinational organization after assuming an oversized role in global affairs. If it is the U.S. setting the boundaries of Europe's defense strategy, Europeans are asking themselves if the subservience is worth it.

The culmination of the Afghan war has taught some bitter lessons. America's self-claimed leadership is in no position to be relied upon for responding to future crises, as the trend from the policies of successive American presidents ¨C however polar they may appear ¨C is taking shape.

The Oval Office is still voicing the need for rebuilding at home, refusing to do away with protectionist tariffs, failing to roll back xenophobic border policies and, most appallingly, walking in and out of wars at will. Europe is visibly uncomfortable with all that.

Since June 2020, European leaders have been working on a document called the Strategic Compass. They want to build self-reliant security capabilities, take independent strategic decisions, and increase the budget for the European Defense Fund.

Europe partnered with the U.S. in the Middle East, North Africa, and Afghanistan for wars it did not want to fight. With the increasingly unilateral nature of the alliance, the exasperation has now crossed the tipping point. A remarkable repositioning in the greater Eurasian region is thus in progress, thanks to America's disinterest leading to detachment and abrupt withdrawals.

Whatever happens in Asia directly affects Europe rather than the city upon a hill that remains entrenched between the Pacific and the Atlantic. The conjuncture is evident from the millions of Afghan refugees in the neighboring countries of Afghanistan and in Europe as compared to the handful in the U.S.

The same ratio holds for the countries most affected by militancy ¨C from neighbors of Afghanistan to Europe and to the U.S. ¨C in the aftermath of the American intervention.

One consequence can be that Europe's pursuance of more strategic autonomy translates into higher defense spending. French President Emmanuel Macron has been calling for establishing a ""true European Army,"" once finding support from German Chancellor Angela Merkel.

European Union's (EU) chief diplomat Josep Borell is asking for the creation of a force of 5,000 soldiers and Merkel's possible successor, Armin Laschet, is demanding to strengthen Europe so that they ""never have to leave it up to Americans.""

The Europeans, however, are missing out on the main reason that has provoked their increased focus on defense: poverty in the third world. Regions that have been hotbeds of extremism are mostly impoverished, with little or no civic and educational infrastructure. Lack of amenities combined with illiteracy builds frustration and the hapless people get played into the hands of fanatics."
"Wang's Southeast Asian trip to reassure old friends, offer help","Editor's note: Adriel Kasonta is a London-based foreign affairs analyst and commentator. He is the founder of AK Consultancy and former chairman of the International Affairs Committee at Bow Group, the oldest conservative think tank in the UK. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

On September 10, 2021, Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi began his weeklong official trip to Vietnam, Cambodia, Singapore and South Korea at the invitation of these countries' officials.

During his first stop, Wang Yi co-chaired the 13th meeting of the China-Vietnam Steering Committee for Bilateral Cooperation with Vietnamese Deputy Prime Minister Pham Binh Minh in Vietnam's capital Hanoi on Friday.

Building on the groundwork set by Chinese President Xi Jinping, General Secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam Nguyen Phu Trong and President of Vietnam Nguyen Xuan Phuc pledged to further enhance the China-Vietnam comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership.

To materialize this development set in the framework of a ""community with a shared future,"" Wang Yi and Pham Binh Minh agreed that their countries should leverage the natural advantage of being connected by land and sea, work for stronger momentum of two wheel-driven economy, trade and investment, accelerate the connectivity and cooperation under the Belt and Road Initiative and the strategy of Two Corridors and One Economic Circle, and strive for greater breakthroughs in bilateral trade volume in 2021.

The two sides declared the setup of the Unimpeded Trade Working Group and signed a new memorandum of understanding on the five-year partnership between the two trade ministries and an agreement on economic and technical cooperation.

They also mentioned a commitment to properly organizing the East Asian leaders' meetings on cooperation and the Summit on Celebrating the 30th Anniversary of China-ASEAN Dialogue Relations with other countries in the region.

Notably, Vietnam, which has been struggling to control its worst COVID-19 outbreak to date, with less than two percent of its population of 98 million people vaccinated so far, also announced that Beijing is donating three million more doses of COVID-19 vaccine this year, raising China's overall vaccine donations to the Southeast Asian country to 5.7 million doses.

On the next day, Wang Yi met with Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh, who informed the visitor that Beijing's prosperity is in his country's best interest, as China's development has provided Vietnam with development models and essential experience for reference.

In an apparent move to treat Vietnam-China relations as a top priority in Hanoi's foreign policy, Vietnam's PM declared that his country will maintain the momentum of economic, trade and investment cooperation with China, keep industrial and supply chains stable and facilitate China's investment in the country.

As far as China's international influence is concerned, Chinh expressed his eagerness to extend the two countries' coordination and cooperation in organizations like the UN, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation and ASEAN.

On September 12, Wang paid a visit to Cambodia, where China is the biggest investor and most influential political partner. For this reason, Wang assured Prime Minister of Cambodia Hun Sen of providing $270 million in aid and three million additional COVID-19 vaccine doses to his country. Wang also officially handed over a new China-funded national stadium worth $150 million to Hun Sen."
Things are looking up for the South,"Editor's note: Stephen Ndegwa is a Nairobi-based communication expert, lecturer-scholar at the United States International University-Africa, author and international affairs columnist. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

The COVID-19 pandemic has had devastating social and economic impacts on the world, but there also have been some surprising outcomes. While the pandemic has hit developed economies hard, developing countries have relatively weathered the storm beyond expectations.

Ahead of last year's United Nations International Day for South-South Cooperation, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres noted that in the present crisis, developing countries were learning from one another and exchanging lessons on ""efficient health systems, effective governance mechanisms, leadership, coordination, communication and community cohesion.""

Guterres reiterated the same message this year by underscoring the crucial role of South-South Cooperation in responding to the current existential threats of COVID-19 and climate change. The call to unity between the South is also a theme that was touched upon by Chinese President Xi Jinping at the virtual 13th BRICS Summit on September 9.

In addition to the South's contribution in the global fight against the pandemic, Xi noted the pivotal role of developing countries in safeguarding multilateralism, managing global economic and financial affairs, political and security cooperation, and fighting terrorism, among other key areas. Over the last decade, these responsibilities have become too heavy and complicated to be left solely to the North.

Indeed, South-South cooperation has come of age. For instance, BRICS, which is a grouping of the world's developing countries, has become a potent force for global change due to its massive economic clout and growing political influence. BRICS is offering leadership to other emerging economies that need economic counsel and capacity building particularly through both production and digital technologies.

The South comprises more than 40 percent of the world's population and over 20 percent of global gross domestic product. Moreover, developing countries have contributed to more than half of the world's growth in recent years, with trade between countries of the South accounting for more than a quarter of all global trade. The massive growth of the big developing economies has enabled them to purchase raw materials from their counterparts at the same rates offered by the developed economies.

Leading developing countries like China have contributed to the global development with their economic prowess and expertise in science and technology. In addition to the country being the world's factory, even for the North, Chinese construction companies are spread across the world, building infrastructural projects. This is also the case with the massive uptake of their advanced but affordable digital technologies that have positively impacted the lives of millions in many countries."
"SDRs should be used by governments, not central banks","Editor's note: Djoomart Otorbaev is the former prime minister of the Kyrgyz Republic, a non-resident senior fellow of Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies at Renmin University of China and a member of the Nizami Ganjavi International Center. The article reflects the author's views and not necessarily those of CGTN.

At the very beginning of the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, it became clear that its impact on the world's affairs would be unprecedented. Among the first to realize the scale of the impending danger of pandemics were international financial institutions.

The World Bank (WB) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) urged G20 countries to establish the specially designed Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI) to help nations safeguard the lives and livelihoods of poor people. Since it took effect on May 1, 2020, the initiative has delivered over $5 billion in relief to more than 40 eligible countries.

A new chapter in the fight with current economic and social challenges began on August 23, when the IMF governors approved a massive $650 billion allocation of Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) to boost global liquidity.

Because of the pandemic, most countries were forced to increase their public debt. In middle-income countries in 2020, it increased by an average of 12 percentage points to 65 percent of their GDP and increased by 17 percentage points to 120 percent of the GDP in developed countries.

Record issuance and distribution of SDRs is the right and timely move. If the risk of debt volatility continued to rise, then monetary stimulus would decline. And if interest rates rise, so will the cost of servicing debt, which would become a massive problem for the stability of the global economy. This step will reduce the risks of fiscal imbalances in the countries' fiscal and debt policies.

SDRs are not traditional money or a means of payment. Technically, these are potential claims of the holder of SDRs for the freely convertible currencies of other IMF members. The SDR exchange rate is determined daily based on exchange rates for a basket of currencies: the U.S. dollar, euro, yen, British pound, and Chinese yuan.

SDRs can be used in different ways, but traditionally they are stored in reserves, providing a higher level of hard currency and positively affecting the stability of national economies.

The last time the IMF issued SDRs was in 2009 to support the economy after the global financial crisis. Until August 23, SDR 204 billion was in circulation. Since August 23, SDR volumes have grown to 660 billion or $935 billion, which is an unprecedented volume comparable to the IMF's share capital."
Afghanistan's humanitarian crisis: A call for regional cooperation,"Editor's note: Mariam Shah is an Islamabad based independent researcher in the field of Conflict Studies and Military Psychology. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

The 20th anniversary of 9/11 attacks approached with an alarming humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan. The decades-long war has left a common man at the mercy of no one. Due to the unplanned and hasty U.S. pullout the ever-emerging challenges and burden have shifted to regional and neighboring countries to ensure peace and stability in the region. The mirage of development and reconstruction during the U.S. era is more visible than ever.

The fractured reform couldn't bring peace and normality to the ordinary Afghans living in remote areas. It will perhaps take no less than another decade to bring normalcy to Afghan people, but immediate relief work is required to support their day-to-day life and slowly bring them out of decades of trauma.

The international community needs to step up assistance before the situation gets out of hand and becomes unbearable for the normal Afghan, who is bruised by the unending crisis. Due to a seemingly endless war and the presence of terrorist groups, Afghanistan has been mired in turmoil, uncertainty, volatility, extreme fragile internal security and mistrust. To address this crucial matter, at the initiative of the Pakistani government a virtual Foreign Ministers' Meeting on the Afghan Issue among Afghanistan's neighboring countries was held earlier this week.

The Foreign Ministers of Pakistan, China, Iran, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan participated and issued a joint statement, expressing ""solidarity with the people of Afghanistan and reiterate the support of the neighboring countries to help bring peace, security, national reconciliation, stability, and development to Afghanistan.""

As soon as the interim government was announced by the Taliban, regional countries started relief efforts for Afghan people. Aids sent by the Pakistani government, including food and medicine, reached Kabul on September 9. Similarly, China announced that it is providing emergency aid of 200 million yuan ($31 million) including food, medical supplies and 3 million COVID-19 vaccine doses to Afghanistan. Earlier, New Zealand announced a $3 million humanitarian aid for Afghanistan to support crisis-hit communities. The amount will be provided to the International Committee of the Red Cross and the United Nations Refugee Agency in Afghanistan who are actively working to provide relief to the masses.

Prerequisites for moving forward

Afghanistan is moving forward with baby steps. The political transformation of Taliban is going to impact Afghanistan and the region for a longer period of time. Taliban is no more an insurgent group, rather an important stakeholder in the country and they should represent themselves as one.

Taliban needs to form a government that will be acceptable internationally and will gather support, assistance and recognition internationally. The interim government they announced lack inclusivity and gender diversity. They can make it better through an all-inclusive settlement, for smooth acceptability across the globe which will further allow humanitarian organizations to initiate their efforts with full force.

Nearly $10 billion of Afghanistan's central bank assets are currently frozen abroad and funds are necessary for the new Taliban government to survive. Taliban needs to prove that they are a better version now and the regional countries can make it happen through supporting and authenticating their role. The West needs to be a bit flexible to find a way to get money into Afghanistan and give Taliban a chance to prove their promises, in order to prevent a total breakdown of the country.

Afghanistan is beyond Kabul, and the humanitarian efforts and relief work should target all the areas in order to provide maximum assistance to people. A stable Afghanistan will definitely guarantee a stable region and Pakistan will benefit the most from peace and stability in Afghanistan. Both countries share the longest border with each other and Pakistan is hosting the most number of Afghan refugees."

Bush's blackmail of 'You are with us or against us' failed the world,"Editor's note: Alfred de Zayas is a professor of international law at the Geneva School of Diplomacy and International Relations in Switzerland. Adriel Kasonta is a London-based political risk consultant and lawyer of Jewish and Tanzanian descent. The article reflects the authors' opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

Twenty years ago, the twin towers in New York fell, and we still do not know precisely what happened. The official report is woefully incomplete and unconvincing, giving rise to numerous conspiracy theories. With 9/11, we have witnessed how the neocons in the U.S. and NATO instrumentalized the terror attack to wage a series of wars and kill millions of people in Afghanistan, Iraq and elsewhere, justifying their invasion and presence through a smokescreen term: ""war on terror.""

As the recent report from the Costs of War project at Brown University revealed, 20 years of post-9/11 wars have cost an estimated $8 trillion and have killed more than 900,000 people. The findings take into account all direct costs of post-9/11 wars.

As far as the death toll is concerned, the research includes U.S. military members, allied fighters, opposition fighters, civilians, journalists and humanitarian aid workers killed as a direct result of war, whether by bombs, bullets or fire. What is worth noting is that this does not include the many indirect deaths the ""war on terror"" has caused by way of disease, displacement and loss of access to food or clean drinking water.

Notably, the 9/11 attacks happened precisely when the imperialist and criminal ""Project for a New American Century"" needed an excuse to be put into effect. In an address to a joint session of the U.S. Congress on September 20, 2001, President George W. Bush called upon every nation on Earth: ""Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists."" He also stated, ""Our war on terror begins with al-Qaeda, but it does not end there,"" adding that ""it will not end until every terrorist group of global reach has been found, stopped and defeated.""

To the military-industrial-financial complex's delight, a series of aggressive wars have been waged against the peoples of countries such as Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya and Syria, generating enormous profits for the war industry. We believe that all can remember the famous words of U.S. General Wesley Clark, who was shocked to learn in 2001: ""I just got this down from upstairs [meaning the Secretary of Defense's office] ... This is a memo that describes how we're going to take out seven countries in five years, starting with Iraq, and then Syria, Lebanon, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and, finishing off, Iran."""
20 years and $2 trillion for what? (Part 1),"Editor's note: Anthony Moretti is an associate professor in the Department of Communication and Organizational Leadership of Robert Morris University. The article reflects the author's views and not necessarily those of CGTN.

Imagine for a moment it is 2001. You and I have just sat down for a conversation a short time after George Bush sent U.S. troops into Afghanistan. In that chat, I say to you that I can predict the future, and it shows the Americans will end up being bogged down there for 20 years and exit only after a wacky U.S. president makes a deal with the Taliban that ensures they will not attack the departing troops.

Would you have believed me?

Perhaps the first question you would have asked would be, ""Who was the wacky president?"" The more important one, ""If the military mission included uprooting the Taliban from power, then how were its forces still playing a leading role in Afghan society 20 years later?"" And perhaps an even more important one, ""How did it go on for so long?""

The U.S. must undertake a thorough and frank review of its failed effort in Afghanistan. Understanding what went wrong is necessary, and not because you or I have any interest in bashing the U.S. for ultimately leaving Afghanistan without completing the mission; rather, it is necessary to review what unfolded because the lessons of Afghanistan need to be learned. Put more bluntly ¨C this history cannot repeat itself anywhere around the globe. And for many people inside the United States, accepting this bad news will not be easy.

The U.S. did not succeed in Afghanistan for multiple reasons, none of which had anything to do with competence. First, Bush's ""war on terror"" meant that al-Qaeda and the Taliban had to be deposited in the trash can of history. That never happened.

Eventually, the purpose of being in Afghanistan included attempting to establish military, political and social networks that would have legitimacy with the people. That never happened.

Instilling a sense of calm among the Afghan citizens was critical. That never happened.

An acknowledgment of the disaster that was Afghan civil society in the early 2000s was required. That never happened.

The ""win hearts and minds"" strategy was needed to show success. That never happened."
"For Vietnam, China is a bulwark against Western interventionism","Editor's note: CGTN's First Voice provides instant commentary on breaking stories. The daily column clarifies emerging issues and better defines the news agenda, offering a Chinese perspective on the latest global events.

As a part of his tour of regional countries, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi visited Vietnam and participated in the 13th meeting of the China-Vietnam Steering Committee for Bilateral Cooperation. Vietnam official media described the visit and the meeting as two countries maintaining positive trends and that Vietnam's Deputy Prime Minister Pham Binh Minh sees win-win cooperation in a number of areas, including senior leadership visits, security issues, economic cooperation and COVD-19 management.

It's time for a closer China-Vietnam relationship, one which is guided by a spirit of mutual interests and growing partnership. It is time for old disputes and differences to be resolved in a productive and pragmatic way, and to ensure that no third countries can drive a wedge between them or stir up contention or distrust. It is a bilateral relationship not just of a historic proportion, but one which embeds enormous potential and promise. As two revolutionary communist states sharing a common ideology, worldview and vision, it is time to find a new way forwards.

Vietnam is on a similar developmental pathway as China. What the two countries hold in common far exceeds what sets them apart. Having successfully pursued a revolution, overthrown the shackles of colonialism and achieved national reunification, Hanoi has since orientated its priorities, like Beijing did, towards achieving national prosperity and development through establishing a socialist market economy, reform and opening up, achieving rapid GDP growth year upon year. There is little doubt that Vietnam will be an economy of the future, and the China-Vietnam relationship will ultimately be a critical bedrock of that potential.

As a result, it is more critical than ever that both countries learn to expand, structure harmonize their bilateral relationship, creating channels of co-existence, interactions and understanding which alleviates strategic mistrust or fear. China and Vietnam should conceive their relationship as neighbors and partners, not potential enemies, rivals or adversaries."
20 years after 9/11: Was the 'global war on terror' worth it?,"The Tribute in Light shines up from Lower Manhattan in New York City, New York, U.S., September 11, 2021. /Getty

Editor's note: Andrew Korybko is a Moscow-based American political analyst. The article reflects the author's views and not necessarily those of CGTN.

The 20th anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks is a somber moment to reflect on how fundamentally the world changed since that fateful day.

The U.S. launched its self-proclaimed ""global war on terror"" in response, invading Afghanistan in order to capture or kill Al Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden, who is blamed for organizing that evil act. He was being provided sanctuary by the Taliban at that time, which continues to this day to deny that he was involved in those attacks. Nevertheless, their largely unrecognized government was overthrown as part of the U.S.'s ""nation-building"" plans for Afghanistan.

America didn't end up killing Bin Laden until nearly a decade later, and even then, it claimed that he was found in the Pakistani military town of Abbottabad. U.S. Special Forces then reportedly buried him at sea.

Between its invasion of Afghanistan and its killing of the Al Qaeda leader, the U.S. also invaded Iraq in 2003 and was in the process of destroying Libya and Syria in early 2011, the second by direct means through NATO airstrikes and the third through proxy ones by arming radical anti-government groups. It also carried out countless drone strikes against alleged terrorist targets in Pakistan, Somalia and Yemen.

The U.S. then didn't leave Afghanistan until over another decade later on August 31, 2021, ironically after the same Taliban that it initially deposed surprisingly returned to power as a result of their lightning-fast nationwide offensive that month during America's chaotic withdrawal.

Less than two years before that, the U.S. killed the leader of the self-described ISIS, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, on October 27, 2019, whose group arose in the wake of America's December 2011 withdrawal from Iraq and the former commander of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Qassem Soleimani on January 7, 2020, who it claimed was a terrorist.

In the two decades since the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the U.S. has been responsible for unprecedented chaos across the region that some of its strategists termed the ""Greater Middle East"" stretching from North Africa to Central Asia.

Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya and Syria are all destroyed, while the assassination of Soleimani almost provoked a war with Iran. The man who's widely regarded by his countrymen and many others in the region as a hero was responsible for fighting against ISIS on the ground in Iraq and Syria. His killing therefore wasn't an ""anti-terrorist"" success like the U.S. claimed, but was objectively a major anti-terrorist setback."
Is there a new beginning for U.S.-China relations?,"Editor's note: William Jones is a Washington policy analyst and a non-resident fellow of the Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

The phone call on September 10 between U.S. President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping was an important encounter that has the potential of setting into motion a new direction in the deteriorating U.S.-China relationship.

The call was initiated by the U.S. side after several meetings between the two sides at lower levels, which generally created little momentum in moving the relationship forward.

The Biden administration seemed to have believed that it could effectively ""compartmentalize"" the various areas comprising the U.S.-China relationship, hoping to strike a deal on climate change and fighting COVID-19 while at the same time fiercely lambasting China for everything from human rights, technology theft, and the alleged cover up of the origins of COVID-19.

Under ordinary circumstances in diplomacy, distinguishing different strands of a relationship between countries is useful and often necessary. But to think that you will find a friendly response from your counterpart on a particular issue while you maintain an absolutely visceral, and even downright mendacious, propaganda on other issues, is somewhat delusional.

Given the intensity of the anti-China mood in the U.S. body politic, inflamed by the anti-China measures of the Trump administration, which have largely been kept intact, and in some cases, exacerbated, by the Biden administration, it will not be easy to put the relationship again on a forward path. But the September 10 phone call could be a start.

This is the second major phone call President Biden has had with President Xi since taking office. And both of these phone calls, while by no means side-stepping the more contentious issues, reiterated the willingness of both sides to maintain a stable U.S.-China relationship, with both parties underlining the importance of the relationship for the world at large.

The calls between the two presidents have been the most fruitful discussions the U.S. has had with China since the beginning of the Biden administration. And it should now be clear that it is only at this highest level that the necessary changes can be made which would facilitate a positive working environment for all the other areas in this important country-to-country relationship."
Learning the right lessons from U.S. economic experimentation,"Editor's Note: Dani Rodrik, professor of International Political Economy at Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government, is the author of ""Straight Talk on Trade: Ideas for a Sane World Economy."" The article reflects the author's opinions, and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

The economic-policy conversation in the United States has been thoroughly transformed within the space of just a few years. Neoliberalism, the Washington Consensus, market fundamentalism - call it whatever you want - has been replaced with something very different.

In macroeconomic policy, debt and inflation fears have given way to a preference for over-stimulating the economy and downplaying the risks to price stability. As for taxation, the tacit acquiescence in a global race to the bottom is out, and establishing a global minimum rate for multinational corporations is in. Industrial policy, which could not even be mentioned in polite company until recently, is back with a vengeance.

The list goes on. Whereas the buzzwords in labor-market policy used to be deregulation and flexibility, now the talk is all about good jobs, redressing imbalances in bargaining power, and empowering workers and unions. Big Tech and platform companies used to be viewed as a source of innovation and consumer benefits; now they are monopolies that need to be regulated and possibly broken up. Trade policy was all about the global division of labor and seeking efficiency; now it is about resilience and safeguarding domestic supply chains.

Some of these changes are necessary adjustments to the COVID-19 shock. And they are perhaps also the inevitable U-turn produced by a long period of rising inequality, economic insecurity, and concentrated market power in the U.S. economy. But credit also rightly belongs to the U.S President Joe Biden, who brought a fresh economic team to Washington and has been quick to endorse new ideas despite criticism from old-timers.

The market-fundamentalist model that previously shaped economic policy in the U.S. and much of Western Europe since the Reagan-Thatcher revolution of the 1980s had a prior intellectual pedigree. It was developed in the halls of academe and popularized by public intellectuals such as Milton Friedman.

This time around, academic economists have been largely playing catch-up. Even though free-market enthusiasm has been waning among economists, there have been no programmatic developments in the style of either Keynesianism or Friedmanite conservatism. Policymakers looking to economists for wholesale solutions that went beyond tinkering would have been disappointed."
Beneath the glamor of the Olympic Games,"Editor's note: Timothy Kerswell is a research fellow at the Chinese University of Hong Kong (Shenzhen). He lived in Macao for seven years, working as an assistant professor at the University of Macao. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

China's performance at the 2021 Tokyo Paralympics was exceptionally good. China's athletes earned 207 medals, 96 of them gold which was substantially better than the second ranked the United Kingdom (124 medals, 41 gold). This performance, the nation's best ever at the Paralympic Games, raises the question of life with disability in China, and the progress the country is making on that front. Gold medals are certainly tremendous achievements, and China's athletes should be celebrated for their success. But beneath the glamor of the Olympic games is an important story of overall social progress.

An important part of China's promotion of the rights of people with disabilities is its legal framework and this begins from the apex of China's legal system. China is one of the few countries in the world where disability rights are addressed as part of the constitution which was framed in 1982. Article 45 of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China states that ""The state and society shall assist arrangements for the work, livelihood and education of citizens who are blind, deaf, mute or have other disabilities.""

This was followed up by the Law of the People's Republic of China on the Protection of Disabled Persons which was enacted in 1990 and provides the basic framework for disability policy in China. It provides a strong commitment that both the state and society have a number of responsibilities toward people with disabilities.

These include rehabilitation of acquired disabilities, and the promotion of education and employment, welfare measures and a built environment conducive to the active participation of people with disabilities in national life. In July this year, a white paper by the State Council Information Office noted that China has published about 90 laws and 50 administrative regulations concerning the protection of the rights and interests of people with disabilities.

With these ambitious goals in mind, it is worth considering the scale and scope of what was proposed. The most recent survey of disability in China was carried out in 2007 which estimated China had about 82.96 million people living with a disability. In other words, it's reasonable to assume that China today has at least 100 million people who have some kind of disability.

To adequately address the policy challenge of disability, China required three fundamental things: firstly an economic base which would provide the state and the society with the resources to address these problems; secondly, an ideological approach which has the ability to put people before profit; and thirdly institutional arrangements to push for and implement pro-disability policies."
President Xi Jinping gives the answer to the question of the century,"Editor's note: This article is an edited translation of a Chinese story published on the Yuyuantantian WeChat account on September 10, 2021. The article reflects the author's opinions, and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

Chinese President Xi Jinping took a phone call from U.S. President Joe Biden on the morning of September 10. They had a candid, in-depth and extensive strategic communications and exchanges on China-U.S. relations and relevant issues of mutual interest.

The call was the eleventh between President Xi Jinping and a head of state or government within a month. President Xi Jinping has attended three important international multilateral events by video in the last month, including the 13th BRICS Summit which he just attended.

It was also the second time this year that Xi spoke by phone with Biden at the U.S. invitation. In its report, CNN emphasized that it was the United States that initiated the call.

When the clouds scudded across the sky, we took it easy. China's head of state diplomacy has always been aiming at strengthening the bonds of global cooperation.

In terms of cooperation, whether the U.S. is sincere or not, China takes it easy.

The China-U.S. relationship is one of the most important bilateral relationships in the world. In the phone call, Xi said, ""China and the United States are respectively the biggest developing country and the biggest developed country. Whether they can handle their relationship well bears on the future of the world. It is a question of the century to which the two countries must provide a good answer.""

Cooperation between China and the United States can lead to many great things for the benefit of both countries and the world. When Biden first took office, the international community had high hopes that he would improve relations between the two countries.

As a member of the first delegation sent by the U.S. Congress to China, Biden, then a senator, first came to China in 1979. In a speech, he pointed out that China's development was good for the United States.

In 2011, Biden visited China again. After that visit, Biden wrote an article in the U.S. media, entitled ""China's Rise Isn't Our Demise."" In the article, he wrote, ""Even as the United States and China cooperate, we also compete. I strongly believe that the United States can and will flourish from this competition.""

On the eve of Chinese New Year, in the first phone call between the two heads of states, Biden sent the greetings to all Chinese people. According to credible sources, that call was initiated by the United States and was also deliberately timed to coincide with the Chinese New Year.

However, the sincerity expressed initially by the U.S. was not followed by practical actions.

Since Biden took office, the two countries have gone further apart. In recent months, the U.S. Congress has seen more bills on China than ever before, with more than a dozen in July alone, most of which recommend policies against or restricting China. The United States has been suppressing and containing China more than ever before.

The United States has reversed the positive stance it took at the beginning. The international community's high hopes for improved China-U.S. relations have been dashed on the rock of harsh realities. According to Wu Xinbo, director at the Center for American Studies of Fudan University, ""The U.S. has made a major strategic miscalculation about China. It sees China as a major strategic competitor and feels that whatever China does is aimed at the United States, that China is undermining the leadership of the United States and that China wants to play a dominant role in the international order.""

China will hold its ground in spite of the pressure and tension. For every trick played by the United States, China has its countermeasure. In the phone call early this year, Xi offered the key to ""breaking the ice"" in China-U.S. relations, ""while the two sides may differ on some issues, it is crucial to show mutual respect and treat each other as equals.""

On March 18 this year, a Chinese delegation was invited to attend a high-level strategic dialogue between the United States and China in Anchorage. The day before the dialogue, the U.S. once again escalated its so-called sanctions against China over the Hong Kong issue. In response, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi fired back during the dialogue, ""This is not supposed to be the way one should welcome his guests, and we wonder if this is a decision made by the United States to try to gain some advantage in dealing with China, but certainly this is miscalculated and only reflects the vulnerability and weakness inside the United States.""

The U.S. has been talking about cooperation on one hand while suppressing and containing China on the other. In response, China shattered the U.S. pipe dream of wanting to do bad things and get good results.

In July, Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman visited China. Before that, the U.S. politician used a petty old trick of wandering around Southeast Asian countries to try to build alliances. The Chinese side directly drew red lines and made demands in the talks, giving ""two lists"" and ""three bottom lines"" regarding the U.S. sanctions on China. China has made clear that it does not accept the U.S. claim that it wants to deal with China from a ""position of strength.""

In hindsight of the embarrassing scene where the U.S. spent half of the previous G7 summit discussing China while receiving little response from other countries, China once again shattered the illusion that the U.S. can suppress China on one hand while making its allies believe that it can dominate U.S.-China relations.

Director Wu said, ""China's attitude is clear that the U.S. 'collaborate, compete, confront' policy framework will not work. The 'two lists' and 'three bottom lines' are meant to establish a new framework for China-U.S. interaction. Only by respecting China's core concerns and vital interests can the U.S. talk about cooperation and extensive competition with China.""

Now the odds are in China's favor.

Hence, there's all the more reason for the U.S. to behave like a major power. Xi said over the phone, ""With the international community facing many common challenges, China and the United States need to show broad vision and shoulder great responsibilities. The two countries should look ahead and press forward, demonstrate strategic courage and political resolve, and bring China-U.S. relations back to the right track of stable development as soon as possible for the good of the people in both countries and around the world.""

At the time of this phone call, the total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the United States this year already exceeded that of last year. As Hurricane Ida rages on, New York and New Jersey have declared a state of emergency."
The tragedy of 9/11 and the shock and awe of 'War on Terror',"Editor's note: Bobby Naderi is a London-based journalist, guest contributor in print, radio and television, and documentary filmmaker. The article reflects the author's opinions, and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

The terrorist attacks in the United States on September 11, 2001 were a perfect crime and a tragedy of the first order. From its opening salvo, the decision by the ""war party"" in Washington to invade heartlands of the Muslim world and target those who ""are against us"" was, however, also an atrocity of the first order.

Twenty years have passed and America's lost ""War on Terror"" has not ended. The obvious scam from the beginning managed to spread across the Greater Middle East and parts of Africa, creating countless failed states. It even gave birth to the Frankenstein of ISIS and left the world a more dangerous place.

In the age of absurdity, the ""Global War on Terror"" players, targeting not one but six Muslim countries ¨C Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Pakistan, Syria and Yemen ¨C used precision-guided bombs and missiles against civilians there. During the process and in the usual fashion, hundreds and thousands of people were killed and wounded, and millions more were made refugees.

Taking a step back to look at the big picture, the persistent, persuasive and destructive legacy of September 11 attacks should no longer haunt the world's collective memory. The U.S. and its allies should also stop spreading sectarian poison or bringing pain and suffering to the Muslim world. For 20 years, they brought civil wars, interventions, assassinations, torture, kidnappings, black sites, the growth of spying programs, and the spread of terrorism in the Middle East and North Africa.

The consequences have been so dreadful that those running the circus of ""War on Terror"" are no longer able to justify the demise of freedom and democracy, the fierce prosecution of whistleblowers, the militarization of the police, state-sanctioned killings without trial, as well as astronomical expenses, bombing campaigns galore, repeated defeats, disasters and failed states on the planet.

Despite 20 years of blind faith in military-first foreign policy, the U.S.-led coalition failed to turn Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria into its protectorates. It also failed to extricate itself from the major wars of the 21st century, nor conduct cooperative diplomacy, nor obey international law.

Thanks to America's chest-beating jingoism, millions are still displaced throughout the volatile region, with many forced to cross the Mediterranean Sea, the cemetery of refugees, in search of safety in Europe. Countless Afghans, Syrians and victims in other countries, who have to walk for months, and sleep rough on station platforms or along a roadside, are still tear-gassed and beaten at borders, or crammed into trains and lorries to make their way to Europe."
U.S. response to 9/11 triggered collapse of its empire,"Editor's note: CGTN's First Voice provides instant commentary on breaking stories. The daily column clarifies emerging issues and better defines the news agenda, offering a Chinese perspective on the latest global events.

After the 9/11 attacks 20 years ago, the United States had the world's sympathy and support. The people of the world, including most Muslims, were generally abhorred by the loss of civilian lives.

However, the U.S. did not rise to the moment with a calm and strategic analysis. Instead, its president reacted with emotion and reflex.

In the hours after the attack, then-president George W. Bush falsely told the public, ""America was targeted for attack because we're the brightest beacon for freedom and opportunity in the world.""

This outright lie made Americans blind to the legitimate grievances against the U.S. in the Islamic world.

Terror mastermind Osama Bin Laden and his attacks never had the support of most Muslims around the globe. But Bush's response to the attacks played perfectly into his hands.

After the attacks, Bin Laden said, ""These events have split the world into two camps: one of faith, with no hypocrites, and one of unbelief.""

As Bin Laden noted, the open-ended ""War on Terror"" succeeded in achieving what the 9/11 attacks failed to do. It set up a perceived clash between the Muslim world and the West that has only strengthened in the last two decades. To take one example, former president Donald Trump kicked off his presidency by trying to ban Muslims from entering the country."

Editor's note: Bradley Blankenship is a Prague-based American journalist, political analyst and freelance reporter. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

Exactly 20 years ago, on September 11, the United States was hit by a series of coordinated terrorist attacks that would leave thousands dead and change the course of history forever.

That's because, in response to these attacks, Washington launched a global ""War on Terror"" that saw two ground invasions ¨C the war in Iraq and the war in Afghanistan ¨C as well as many other military interventions. Recent events, however, suggest that this war might be changing.

On August 31, President Joe Biden announced the end to the war in Afghanistan following a humiliating retreat by U.S. forces that saw the Taliban seize control over the country ¨C as well as a deadly terrorist attack that left 13 U.S. soldiers and about 170 Afghans dead.

Striking a defiant tone, Biden said that the U.S. needed to adapt to the threats of today and move past the threats of 20 years ago. In that vein, he said that the withdrawal from Afghanistan was the end of an era of U.S. foreign policy centered on war, regime change and efforts to ""remake other countries.""

Instead, according to the president, the U.S. should now focus on missions that have clear and achievable goals and that have specific national security interests.

While this rhetoric was genuinely unprecedented for a U.S. president, it is a hollow promise. That's because, as Biden referenced in his speech, the U.S. still has ""over the horizon"" capabilities ¨C meaning drones and missile strikes, which are expected to be a crucial part of his new guidelines ¨C to combat adversaries overseas, which is an act of war.

Biden even went so far as to praise the latest example of how this global assassination program was implemented when he mentioned the ""defensive"" drone bombing in Kabul that killed 10 members of one family, including seven children (In essence, Biden murdered a family in retaliation for a terrorist attack that killed U.S. service members).

It should be noted that this is not just a one-off mistake but actually a feature of the U.S. drone assassination program. Out of a minimum estimation of about 14,000 drone strikes since 2004, somewhere between 900-2,200 civilians have died which includes between 283-454 children, according to the London-based Bureau of Investigative Journalism that tracks these figures."
13th summit shows BRICS rising as U.S.-dominated system crumbles,"Editor's note: Andy Mok is a research fellow at Center for China and Globalization. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

With about 42 percent of global population coupled with the world's greatest economic momentum, diversity and vibrancy, BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) possesses a greater degree of legitimacy in speaking for a world of nearly eight billion people than does the so-called liberal international order dominated and increasingly weaponized by the United States.

And this international order may be crumbling as a series of missteps by the United States such as the invasion of Iraq, the 2008 financial crisis, the mishandling of the COVID-19 pandemic and the recent disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan has unleashed a crescendo of alarm around the world about its ability to address increasingly urgent and complex global challenges and prompted many countries to scramble for alternative solutions. Moreover, the increasing fixation with turning China into an adversary has prompted even the closest allies of the United States to express doubt about its strength and even viability as a forceful global actor with Ehud Olmert, former Israeli PM commenting, ""When I hear the Americans talking about their fear of China, I too begin to worry that the U.S.'s strength is actually much weaker than we thought it was.""

And it is in this context that Chinese President Xi said at this year's BRICS Summit on September 9, ""We need to make good use of BRICS mechanisms such as the meeting of foreign ministers and the meeting of high representatives for security, better coordinate our position on major international and regional issues, and send out an even bigger, collective voice of BRICS countries.""

Chaired by India this year, the theme of the summit was ""Intra-BRICS cooperation for continuity, consolidation and consensus"" with areas of priority including counter-terrorism, using digital and technological tools for achieving sustainable development goals (SDGs) and enhancing people-to-people exchanges. Echoing President Xi's call, India's Prime Minister Modi noted, ""Despite COVID situation this year, over 150 BRICS meetings and events were organized. Of these, over 20 were ministerial-level."""
To teachers: Illuminating the search for well-being,"Editor's note: Wang Yan is an associate research fellow at Beijing Foreign Studies University. The article reflects the author's opinions, and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

Teachers matter. A teacher is oftentimes perceived as a knowledgeable person who inspires and illuminates the road in search for knowledge and for meaning of life. They guide the changes in students' intellectual and spiritual growth and therefore have an impact on social and economic development.

Today marks Teachers' Day in China. However, many teachers in the country are facing new changes in their work due to newly issued ""double reduction"" policy, which aims to ease the excessive homework and after-school tutoring burden on students. The policy also obligates schools to extend their education services as alternative of off-campus tutoring.

The policy is underpinned by the rationale that private supplementary tutoring, associated with excessive learning burden, not only has a psychologically and educationally negative impact on children's well-being but also exacerbates social and economic inequalities by dividing those who pay for tutoring services and who don't.

With the ""double reduction"" policy taking effect, students will have less workload in terms of tutoring and homework, and could also access on-campus learning services after school and during holidays, leading a more enjoyable study life at a lower cost.

Meanwhile, the new policy implies tremendous changes to teachers. Teachers in public schools will have to change their teaching approaches and modalities to maintain or even improve students' learning performance with less homework and examinations. Besides, teachers and tutors in private agencies will have to change their jobs and even go through temporary unemployment because some for-profit agencies may close down.

In the past, the teachers in public schools, in spite of their teaching performance, in many cases could have their students fare well in examinations as many students use paid tutoring services outside of the class. But now the teachers have to rely on quality teaching in class to achieve the learning goals, with more emphasis on cost-efficiency of learning and education, so the new policy requires teachers to learn, adapt and grow quickly. On the other hand, it warrants better curriculum and pedagogy, better school-based management and better parent-school partnership.

While all the tutoring agencies are transformed into nonprofit agencies, the tutors might temporarily lose their clients and have less income. Yet teaching should not be a lucrative profession, and marketization and privatization is contrary to the purpose of education. The tutors could still work in non-profit tutoring agencies or other education institutions. Those dedicated teachers with know-hows would still be able to realize their aspiration through various pathways, such as teaching in the emerging adult education industry, given the workforce's growing demand for reskilling and upskilling. Another option is arts-related training because arts will play an increasingly important role in the market."
China to the U.S.: There's no time for petty politics,"Editor's note: CGTN's First Voice provides instant commentary on breaking stories. The daily column clarifies emerging issues and better defines the news agenda, offering a Chinese perspective on the latest global events.

When a country is divided domestically, finding a common enemy is a time-tested way to bring people together. This is the transparent reason why the deeply troubled and divided U.S. has painted China as a boogeyman over the past few years.

This may be good domestic politics, but detrimental diplomatically.

On September 10, Chinese President Xi Jinping and U.S. President Joe Biden had a phone conversation in which both sides characterized as an attempt to make sure both nations do not spiral into confrontation. Xi said that both countries need to show broad vision and shoulder great responsibilities. The two countries should demonstrate strategic courage and political resolve, and bring China-U.S. relations back to the right track of stable development.

This will be a difficult challenge for Biden, who already looks weak due to the botched withdrawal from Afghanistan ¡ª an error that is exacting heavy political cost on him. The embarrassing end to the two-decade campaign in Afghanistan has diminished U.S. stand as the world's superpower, an image that the Biden administration seeks to restore.

And this anti-China trend, stirred by Biden's predecessor, is leaving lasting impact on U.S. politics. Former U.S. President Donald Trump, during the catastrophic final year of his presidency, tried to distract Americans from his unfathomable failure to protect his people from COVID-19 by blaming China for not only the pandemic, but also for all the economic problems facing ordinary Americans.

In an intensive U.S. disinformation campaign, Washington has slung shovelful after shovelful of mud at China in an attempt to denigrate and isolate the rising power. The U.S. has falsely suggested that China is conducting a genocide in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region and hinted China deliberately manufactured and leaked a deadly virus. These baseless claims serve to dehumanize the Chinese people, as witnessed by rising hate crimes in the U.S. against Asian-Americans."
7th GMS Summit brings pragmatism and strategic wisdom to the table,"Editor's note: Hamzah Rifaat Hussain, a former visiting fellow at the Stimson Center in Washington and a former assistant researcher at the Islamabad Policy Research Institute (IPRI), is a TV anchor of Indus News in Pakistan. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

Sustainability and inclusivity, which have historically been the hallmarks of Southeast Asia, were once again reinforced at the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) Summit of 2021 which featured Laos, China, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam. Chinese Premier Li Keqiang called upon all member states to broaden current areas of cooperation which includes taking due cognizance of the pernicious effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on their respective domestic economies. This message and the strategic frameworks agreed upon carry plenty of strategic significance.

Hosted by Phnom Penh in Cambodia, the 7th summit of the GMS resulted in all parties agreeing on adopting a new strategic program which is the GMS's third overall. Note that the framework outlines key areas for deliberation such as climate change, protectionism and economic complexities. Taking a lead from the goodwill of 1992 with the launch of a development program by the Asian Development Bank, a joint will to tackle issues such as the scarcity of resources was expressed this time around. The pragmatism on the subject of water scarcity for coastal regions for example, is based on addressing the ""center-periphery"" divide which has historically had a deleterious impact on sovereign economies. Note further that each of the GMS member states are grappling with widening income inequalities which has been exasperated further by the pandemic.

Secondly, the strategic framework agreed upon is both comprehensive and all encompassing. Two documents released, which are the GMS Strategic Framework 2030 (GMS-2030) and the GMS COVID-19 Response and Recovery Plan of 2021 and 2023, are for immediate consideration, where recovery plans on the pandemic involve provision of unfettered and unconditional access of vaccines to all member states for which the Cambodian Prime Minister personally thanked his counterpart Premier Li Keqiang for the role China has played. By establishing an unfettered relationship with China, the capital Phnom Penh has the highest vaccination rate in the world for capital cities with Mekong countries also being the first recipients of vaccine aid from Beijing in August 2020. Furthermore, the recovery plan on the pandemic is a regional equivalent to the UN sponsored global COVAX program, which is built on the spirit of multilateralism and collective responses."
President of the BRICS New Development Bank on growing membership,"The Shanghai-headquartered BRICS New Development Bank (NDB) announced the enrollment of the United Arab Emirates, Uruguay and Bangladesh as the three new members in the latest wave of global expansion. Set up by the emerging economies of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, this is the first time that New Development Bank has introduced new countries to the list since the official establishment in 2015. What kind of changes will the new members bring to the future of NDB? How can different economies form a consensus? CGTN Host Tian Wei had an interview with Marcos Troyjo, the President of New Development Bank, on the topic of new member states and the possibilities of the future ahead."
UNHCR chief on Afghanistan,"Climate change, COVID-19 pandemic, conflicts, and calamities are crises in the world today. What these crises inevitably lead to are people forced to flee their homes, face starvation and often fight for their survival. That's where the United Nations High Commission for Refugees steps in, to help ease the misery of humanity seeking refuge from the worst catastrophes. Today, these refugee hotspots include the poorest pandemic-hit nations, aid-starved Afghanistan and conflicts in Africa. China has done its part in supporting UNHCR work that has helped tens of thousands with healthcare and shelter in Afghanistan, Iran and Pakistan. China announced on Wednesday it will provide more than $30 million worth of emergency supplies to Afghanistan. CGTN host Tian Wei had a chance to catch up with the UNHCR chief, Filippo Grandi."
Stronger together in trade: Why CAEXPO matters,"Editor's note: Hannan Hussain is a foreign affairs commentator and author. He is a Fulbright recipient at the University of Maryland, the U.S., and a former assistant researcher at Islamabad Policy Research Institute. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

All roads lead to the Chinese southern city Nanning on September 10, the opening day of the 18th China-ASEAN Expo (CAEXPO) and the China-ASEAN Business and Investment Summit (CABIS). Taken together, they are a dynamic four-day exercise featuring participation from nearly 400 foreign companies converging in the capital of south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. This year's expo will cover a combined exhibition space of 124,000 square meters, hosting exchange activities that span science and technology, economy, trade, health and digital economy spheres.

The expo's opening, on the heels of a three-decade dialogue anniversary of ASEAN-China relations, speaks of a priority ¨C the iconic symbolism, trade and economic consistency necessary to advance the event's expansion and platform functionality this year. Given how investor and enterprise sentiment suffers from uncertainty in the broader region amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, the 18th CAEXPO builds momentum from the success of last year's economic pathways for China-ASEAN cooperation and the broad external representation that bolstered it.

There is little doubt that at this year's CAEXPO and CABIS, trade integration initiatives stand to gain plenty. Consider the fusion of over two dozen high-level forums with scores of trade and economic promotion activities ¨C such a combination is important to under girding the Belt and Road's construction, and to further consolidating the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP). On the former front, a wide-ranging consensus among ASEAN countries is already evident: the digital and infrastructure connectivity footprint of the BRI has proved rewarding, and that a forward-looking approach should spill success from current ventures into other fields of mutual interest. Recent history presents its own incentive for optimism as well. Trade between China and ASEAN reached $684.6 billion in 2020, and total cumulative mutual investment stood in excess of $310 billion by June-end this year."
20 years of U.S. war on terror: Far and wide a failure,"Editor's note: CGTN's First Voice provides instant commentary on breaking stories. The daily column clarifies emerging issues and better defines the news agenda, offering a Chinese perspective on the latest global events. Has the United States succeeded in its war on terror? As the 20th anniversary of 9/11 descends upon us, that's the question people are seeking answers to. It didn't fail. Since September 11, 2001, the U.S. has not experienced a terrorist attack approaching the magnitude of what happened on that day. Osama Bin Laden, the mastermind behind the attack, was hunted down and killed. The organization he led ¨C Al Qaeda ¨C was weakened, battered and, in U.S. President Joe Biden's words, is now one of ""yesterday's threats."" Security for the homeland and justice for the dead were achieved. The past two decades sound like a success, don't they? Not exactly, if the American people are asked. A Washington Post-ABC News poll released on September 8 showed that 46 percent of Americans believed 9/11 changed the country for the worse. In September 2002, the figure was 27 percent, while 55 percent thought it had changed the country for the better. Now, only 33 percent think the same. Of course, the pessimism about America can be attributed to many things. The poll was taken during the U.S.' messy withdrawal from Afghanistan and amid a surging pandemic that is claiming the lives of more than 1,000 Americans each day. But the truth is that in the 20 years of the war on terror, its impact on the U.S. has gone well beyond a security matter.

One of the architects of this war on terror, former U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, made the argument that democracy was the antidote to terrorism on multiple occasions. Democracies ""don't harbor terrorists,"" she said in 2017, adding that ""we have a practical reason to want to see the number of democratic states grow. We will have a more peaceful, prosperous world."" No matter how hard she, the rest of the Bush administration or other similar-minded U.S. foreign policy officials argued that Iraq and Afghanistan were security issues and not about the U.S. toppling regimes to establish like-minded nations, that is what happened. At each juncture over the 20 years, wherever the U.S. had military invested, it tried to change the type of rule in place into an acceptable (to the U.S.) form of democratic structure. That has been the bane of America's crusade. This bomb-and-vote tandem, while costing the country $8 trillion in war-related expenditure according to Brown University's research, has not brought upon the end results that America wanted. Afghanistan is a country with a deeply divided and war-torn society. Syria remains in a brutal civil war. The Iraq War had at least 100,000 civilian deaths. And along the way, ISIS grew into and remains a security threat. The organization's Afghan-affiliated ISIS-K killed 13 American military personnel and injured hundreds of Afghan civilians during the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan. Meanwhile, average Americans, despite not being directly impacted by the war, have suffered a more insidious decline. The over-investment, both political and financial, in wars overseas has left the U.S. society and infrastructure in a decrepit state. According to the Federal Reserve's Distribution of Household Wealth in the U.S. chart, in early 2001, the top 1 percent of the population accounted for around 26 percent of the country's household wealth, while the bottom 50 percent accounted for 3 percent. By 2021, the proportion of the country's wealth held by the top 1 percent had expanded to 32 percent, while that of the bottom 50 percent had shrunk to 2 percent.

Editor's note: John Gong is a professor at the University of International Business and Economics and a research fellow at the Academy of China Open Economy Studies at UIBE. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily those of CGTN. Twenty years after the BRICS concept (originally BRIC with South Africa later added) was coined, the economic power of the BRICS countries is nearly on par with that of the G7, primarily because of the rise of China, which has grown to be more than twice the size of the rest of the four put together. In a recent op-ed piece by Jim O'Neill, who originally invented the BRIC concept in a research report for Goldman Sachs, he wrote that if it weren't for China, there wouldn't be much of a BRICS story at all, either economically, or politically.

It is against that backdrop that Chinese President Xi Jinping delivered his speech at the 13th BRICS summit meeting. The speech was extraordinarily short but succinct to the point, laying out the four areas of focus for BRICS in the future, and five concrete proposals from China, including the announcement of a $100 million donation for the COVID-19 vaccination cause, and additional 100 million COVID-19 vaccines. The four areas of focus are worth highlighting in light of the BRICS' economic and political standing vis-¨¤-vis the G7 in terms of its representation of the emerging markets and the broader developing world. Led by the U.S., the G7 bloc loves to talk about the rules-based global order, while dancing around the issue of what rules and what global order it refers to. Xi's first area of focus squarely refutes that equivocal notion by referring to a global order that is based on the Charter of the United Nations, what he calls the true multilateralism.

China emerges as the champion on Afghanistan's soft security needs,"Editor's note: Andrew Korybko is a Moscow-based American political analyst. The article reflects the author's views and not necessarily those of CGTN.

Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi announced during Wednesday's first virtual Foreign Ministers' Meeting on Afghanistan that his country will provide $31 million worth of aid to its struggling war-torn neighbor. This package includes grain, winter supplies, vaccines and medicines. The top diplomat also said that both sides should work towards restoring cargo railway services and cooperate in the fight against drugs and terrorism. In addition, Wang called on the U.S. and its allies to assume responsibility by aiding Afghanistan too.

This development proves that China has emerged as the champion of Afghanistan's soft security needs, which refers to the socio-economic support that countries require in order to tackle the systemic causes of hard security threats. Poverty is among the main roots of instability in many countries. Those who suffer from it sometimes begin to resent their government and thus become susceptible to devious suggestions from hostile actors who tempt them with much-needed money or by manipulating their ideologies into taking up arms.

While there will always be some extremists who are crazed enough to kill without any reason, nobody can deny that they'd have much greater difficulty recruiting others to their cause if their potential targets were leading normal lives with decent standards. This is especially the case in war-torn countries like Afghanistan, which has suffered from incessant conflict over the past four decades. Sustainably reconstructing Afghanistan's socio-economic fabric is therefore among one of the most urgent priorities for the country's regional stakeholders.

China's promised aid is aimed at ensuring that the situation there doesn't deteriorate during the coming months. Some have warned about the risks of drought worsening Afghans' already fraught food security. COVID-19 also remains a threat. The country's interim Taliban-appointed government lacks the financial means at the moment to proactively deal with these challenges after the U.S. froze $9 billion worth of assets while the IMF and World Bank suspended financial cooperation with Kabul after the group's takeover last month."
"9/11 twenty years on: Afghan war over, antiterrorism goes on (Part II)","Editor's note: Tao Wenzhao is a senior research fellow at the Institute of American Studies, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. The article reflects the author's views and not necessarily those of CGTN.

The Biden administration ended the war in Afghanistan by simply following his predecessors' unfulfilled plans. His withdrawal and evacuation operation was organized and implemented in a miserably messy way. The evacuation operation of the U.S. citizens was chaotic due to the lack of information on the exact number of Americans in Afghanistan and the number to be evacuated. The evacuation from Bagram Air Base was no better than an abscondence. Moreover, communications with the allies were insufficient. All of these would have been avoided had the Biden administration made elaborate plans.

Second, this evidenced America's failed attempt to impose its values on Afghanistan. After the end of the Cold War, U.S. administrations have made promoting American-style democracy and values around the world as one of the three pillars of its foreign policy. The Bush administration was particularly enthusiastic about democracy promotion. With the ultimate goal of ""ending tyranny in our world,"" he set the Freedom Agenda and named the war in Afghanistan ""Operation Enduring Freedom.""

During his presidency, he drew up ambitious plans to introduce Western-style democracy to the Middle East, including 22 Arab and Islamic countries and Afghanistan, with the aim of implementing comprehensive political, economic, diplomatic and cultural reforms over a 30-year period ¨C the so-called Greater Middle East Initiative. That explained why the Taliban called the Afghanistan War ""a war against Islamic civilization."" The U.S. government assumed it could leverage its overwhelming power to impose American values on Afghanistan and Iraq.

But democracy is not Coca-Cola that tastes the same everywhere in the world. It is a product of historical evolution, which in different civilizations assumes very different forms and content. The U.S. was bound to go awry in its forcible application of the American-style democracy to Iraq and Afghanistan and fall into the trap of ""clash of civilizations.""

In his speech on August 31, Biden defended the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan, saying, ""This decision about Afghanistan is not just about Afghanistan. It's about ending an era of major military operations to remake other countries."""

Editor's note: Tao Wenzhao is a senior research fellow at the Institute of American Studies, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. The article reflects the author's views and not necessarily those of CGTN. This year marks the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the United States. On September 12, 2001, the day after the attacks, the United Nations (UN) Security Council adopted Resolution 1368, expressing its determination to ""combat by all means threats to international peace and security caused by terrorist acts"" and ""recognizing the inherent right to individual or collective self-defense in accordance with the Charter."" The Bush administration declared a global war on terror and assembled a multinational force to launch a war against al-Qaeda and the Taliban. Twenty years later, the Biden administration ended the war with a disastrous withdrawal that disgraced the country and depleted its soft power. The U.S. war in Afghanistan is just another example of Afghanistan being the ""graveyard of empires."" What are the reasons behind all this?

First, the Bush administration made a strategic mistake by initiating the Iraq War. The status quo in Afghanistan might have turned out differently if the U.S. had helped the Afghan people establish a good and clean government that is democratically elected so that Afghanistan could gradually get on the right track of governance, trained the Afghan security forces to maintain national stability, or helped the country pursue national reconciliation. But the old and new conservatives in the Bush administration, as represented by then Vice President Dick Cheney, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, and Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz, fixated on the removal of Saddam Hussein. When the Gulf War began, they pushed for his overthrow. After President Bush took office, he characterized Saddam Hussein as one of the ""axis of evil."" In March 2003, the Bush administration launched a unilateral preemptive war against Iraq without authorization of the UN Security Council. Iraq then became the main battleground for ""counterterrorism"" and distracted most of the attention from the Afghanistan War. By the end of 2003, only 6,000 government troops in Afghanistan had been trained. President Barack Obama, who opposed the Iraq war, made a terrible mistake in his fulfillment of campaign promises and withdrew all U.S. troops from Iraq in late 2011, leaving behind a huge power vacuum that contributed to the rise of the ""Islamic State."" Obama did deliberate on the Afghanistan War and put forward the New Strategy for Afghanistan and Pakistan in March 2009.

Afghan children killed by the U.S. forces must not die for nothing,"Editor's note: Xin Ping is a commentator on international affairs who writes regularly for CGTN, Global Times and China Daily. He can be reached at xinping604@gmail.com. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

For Afghans in the past 20 years, the unfairness in life has been so painfully prominent that it has extended to the domain of death. At the same time as Joe Biden mourned 13 U.S. soldiers whose bodies were brought back home covered in star-striped flags, at least 10 members of an Afghan family, including six children, were killed in a U.S. drone strike. It is still not clear how and why the tragedy happened, not to mention justice or compensation for the victims.

Following the so-called ""defensive strike"" targeting a vehicle in a residential neighborhood of Kabul, an ordinary family shattered just in seconds amid flame and smoke. According to their neighbors, ""not much is left of their house and nothing can be recognized, they are in pieces."" Relatives of the victims gathered in the hospital identifying remains and separating them into coffins. Two-year-old girls, Malika and Sumaya, were among the names marked on the coffins. A more ironical fact was that the family had applied for evacuation to the U.S., and had been waiting for a phone call telling them to go to the airport. Ahmad Naser, who was killed in the strike, had previously worked as a translator for the U.S. forces. Until death they never knew why they received a strike rather than the phone call they had been yearning for.

In the eyes of the Pentagon, apparently, those who live without dignity also die without significance. As always, they promised investigations and claimed to be transparent, but no detail of an ongoing probe has been given: no timeline, no person in charge, no proper solution.

Remarks made by Pentagon press secretary John Kirby betrayed him that they seem to have spent more time finding excuses instead of pursuing accountability for the perpetrators and bringing justice to the victims. Kirby defended the military by arguing ""no military on the face of the Earth works harder to avoid civilian casualties than the United States,"" but did he not realize that the U.S. is obviously not a kid who can run away with the mess he has made by just saying ""I've tried""? Still for many in the Pentagon and the White House, the unforgivable mistake is just an unpleasant trivia that should be quickly buried under the ""spectacular"" evacuation figures and hyped-up stories of military heroes."
Guinea coup a wake-up call for Africa to stay focused,"Members of Guinea's special forces are seen outside the Palace of the People in Conakry, Guinea, September 6, 2021. /Xinhua

News of the recent coup in Guinea by members of the country's elite force has jolted the international community. At a time when the world has come together to fight the COVID-19 pandemic and engage in economic recovery efforts, mutiny was a far-fetched possibility.

Editor's note: Stephen Ndegwa is a Nairobi-based communication expert, lecturer-scholar at the United States International University-Africa, author and international affairs columnist. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

Immediately following the coup, international players decried the ripple adverse socioeconomic and political effects. For instance, in a statement on September 6, China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said, ""We are closely monitoring the situation in Guinea. We noted relevant statements by the African Union (AU) and the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). We hope relevant parties can exercise calm and restraint, bear in mind the fundamental interests of the nation and people, resolve the relevant issue through dialogue and consultation and safeguard peace and stability in Guinea.""

While the continent is not off the hook yet to the prospects of coups, many Africans are fatigued by this phenomenon. Guineans are under no illusion that the overthrowing of President Alpha Conde will instantly transform their country for the better. Similarly, the mutineers in Guinea understand that these are not the old times when they could run roughshod over the status quo without due process.

In a tweet, United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres also strongly condemned the coup and called for Conde's immediate release.

Indeed, the pressure so far has worked. Over the weekend, the junta reopened the country's international borders and promised to hold a meeting between its leaders and members of the nation's ousted cabinet to discuss the transition. On September 8, the ECOWAS suspended Guinea's membership and are expected to send a high-level mission to the country for dialogue.

The current crisis in the West African nation is a culmination of a political crisis that has been simmering for several months. In October 2020, the AU, the ECOWAS and the UN released a joint communique following a ""High-Level Solidarity Mission for the Promotion of a Credible, Transparent and Peaceful Presidential Election in The Republic of Guinea."" The Guinea coup also follows a trend that seems to have started in the region, with a coup d'etat in Mali in May and an attempted coup in Niger in March.

But Africa has really moved on and the continent now is thinking economy rather than politics. According to the African Economic Outlook 2021 titled ""From Debt Resolution to Growth: The Road Ahead for Africa"" published by the African Development Bank Group, Africa's post-COVID-19 economic prospects are looking up. The report says Guinea's economy has been resilient amid the pandemic, with the real GDP growing more than the forecast at the start of the pandemic.

Similarly, the report says that Africa's growth performance and outlook is projected to recover this year from its worst economic recession in 50 years. The continent's real GDP in Africa is projected to grow by 3.4 percent in 2021, after contracting by 2.1 percent in 2020.

While the continent's encouraging recovery is based on the resumption of tourism, a rebound in commodity prices and the rollback of pandemic-induced restrictions, the report warns that the outlook is subject to great uncertainty from both external and domestic risks. Unconstitutional government changes like the Guinea coup ranks high among such drawbacks.

Chaos in African countries will also have international ramifications by interfering with value chains in the supply of crucial raw materials. Trade has now been stalled, with consequences for all partners involved.

Ultimately, the coup is evidence of the West's superimposed democratic culture in Africa. Many African countries were forced to adopt two-term presidential limits in addition to the multi-party system. It is instructive that the West has not demanded these kind of political arrangements in other regions who retain the prerogative to maintain leaders as long as they are popular with the people and deliver their mandate satisfactorily.

This and other conditions set for Western aid to African countries are really meant to distract them from focusing on their socioeconomic development as perennial political bickering undermines the development agenda. To develop, African countries need peace in order to have a conducive atmosphere where it can thrive. Anything that disturbs this peace should be shunned by all patriotic Africans.

UK must learn it cannot depend on U.S. leadership,"Editor's note: CGTN's First Voice provides instant commentary on breaking stories. The daily column clarifies emerging issues and better defines the news agenda, offering a Chinese perspective on the latest global events.

UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson called for continued support of the U.S. leadership on the Taiwan question after anti-China MP Iain Duncan Smith put forward this issue in the House of Commons on Wednesday. ""It's absolutely vital that this country continues to insist on the primacy of our relationship with the United States,"" Johnson said, adding that ""the only answer, the only way forward is to continue to support American global leadership, and that is what we will do.""

The UK's relationship with the United States is often referred to as a special one. Built on the idea of Anglophone exceptionalism, it is portrayed almost exclusively in chauvinist light and appeals to the country's own nostalgia of having been a great power. On this premise, the UK has often been overtly subservient and loyal to the foreign policy interests of the United States, and has always portrayed the partnership between the two as being of equals, when it is not.

For decades, British foreign policymakers have ignored and played down the fact that not everything the U.S. does is in their country's national interest, especially in a changing world. The Downing Street has been frequently too quick to follow and too hesitant to question the demands of the White House.

Never has this been more apparent than in the aftermath of the recent fiasco in Afghanistan, where a self-interested U.S. decided to abruptly depart the country, leaving behind a mess which even the UK troops found hard to wade through.

The U.S. does not and has not respected the UK's interests.

The pattern is clear: Washington does want it wants, as it suits, without caring for its allies or any ""special relationship."" The U.S.-led warmongering in Afghanistan, Iraq and other countries have cost hundreds of British lives, cost the taxpayer billions, and for what? All for the unbridled subservience not to the UK's but America's ambitions."
NATO's fearmongering about Chinese nukes is nefarious,"Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin responded to NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg's claims Monday that the People's Republic is rapidly expanding its nuclear arsenal by reminding him that Beijing's stance on this issue is responsible, defensive and proportional. Moreover, China has never threatened any other country, whether through nuclear means or otherwise, and doesn't base such weapons outside of its borders. Furthermore, it has a no-first-use policy.

Stoltenberg likely wasn't hyping up the theory of a Chinese nuclear threat just for rhetorical sake but almost certainly has some nefarious intentions behind doing so. The NATO Communique from the bloc's June 2021 Summit put forth similarly unsubstantiated accusations and thus reflected the American-led alliance's desire to gradually shift towards containing China. The narrative being spun ominously resembles the one that the U.S. has pushed against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) and Iran to justify moves against them.

On the contrary, the U.S. has a policy of using nuclear weapons first in a conflict whenever it sees fit, having not only done so twice at the end of World War II against an already crippled Imperial Japan but also recently flirting with the idea of so-called ""tactical nukes."" America also deploys nuclear weapons outside of its borders such as in Europe and has nuclear-equipped submarines roaming the world's oceans waiting to strike whoever it might be if given the fateful order to do so.

The Pentagon has deployed so-called ""missile defense"" infrastructure near their borders under the pretext of stopping any supposedly unilateral strike that either of those two might one day make against U.S. forces in their regions or those of its allies. In reality, Russia has long accused its historical rival of exploiting such systems to undermine the Kremlin's nuclear second-strike capabilities which serve as the only deterrent to a nuclear first strike from the United States. Moscow suspects that this infrastructure might also be equipped with offensive weaponry.

In particular, fears nowadays abound ever since former U.S. President Donald Trump pulled his country out of the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty. The fears are that such arms might be secretly deployed at ""missile defense"" sites and eventually employed to carry out sneak attacks against America's foes. This is also a pressing threat scenario for China since the U.S. aspires to expand such infrastructure in the Asia Pacific, especially in Japan, and reportedly also some of the Pacific Island nations that Washington is allied with.

NATO's fearmongering about Chinese nukes could therefore be connected to the U.S. plan to gradually get the alliance it leads to participate in these sorts of anti-Chinese containment plans. These concerns are justified by part of paragraph 6e of the earlier-referenced NATO Communique which reads that ""We will increase our dialogue and practical cooperation with existing partners, including with the European Union, aspirant countries and our partners in the Asia Pacific."" It's vague enough to refer to such security cooperation.

Some of NATO's leading members such as Germany, France and the UK have also recently taken to dispatching warships to the South China Sea in provocative moves that prompted warnings from Beijing. These decisions were likely coordinated with the U.S. in order to get their leaderships to expand their operational presence in this part of the world. America hopes that they'll one day participate in regional ""missile defense"" programs there, whether through their own ship-based platforms and/or arming regional partners with such systems.

None of this could be ""justified"" in the eyes of their people without first convincing them to believe that China's very limited and purely defensive nuclear capabilities allegedly threaten the U.S.-envisioned ""rules-based order"" which itself is simply a euphemism for dominating all other countries. This is extremely dangerous and means NATO's false accusations against China could seriously jeopardize world peace if they lead to the deployment of more ""missile defense"" infrastructure to the region under that manufactured pretext.

The future of Afghanistan in the context of the BRI,"The widespread consensus is that emphasizing these three sectors will lead to a more robust and self-sustaining economy, which will result in unleashing the country's potential for commencing and building territorial economical competition, inter-connectivity and cooperative development, the equivalent of which has never been seen before.

In the past, the government of Afghanistan prioritized participation in the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). The BRI has been portrayed as a regional cooperation model in which China and Afghanistan will mutually benefit while participating in energy sectors, natural assets extraction and business enterprise services. Former Chief Executive of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan Abdullah Abdullah paid a visit to China in May 2016. During his visit, foreign ministers from both sides inked an MoU to expand areas of collaboration under the umbrella of the BRI. In the light of this historical MoU, China appears to view Afghanistan as a partner ""well-positioned"" to assist Beijing in connecting to the rest of the region through the Belt and Road Initiative Project.

Engaging in regional economic projects should be a centerpiece of the Taliban's government, and their foreign policy should be seen as a path to restoring peace and protective covering of international projects in a spoiled country. While expressing the desire to link Afghanistan with regional economic activities and international projects that advance its foreign policy, the new Taliban government must also be aware of global and regional issues which support them. They must also try to forge out their national interests within these economic undertakings as well as develop the appropriate measures to defend those interests. Nonetheless, if Afghanistan wants to become self-sustaining in the near future, it will need to make suitable economical modalities to divorce itself from erratic assistance.

Due to this mega infrastructure project, a stable Taliban government would be able to connect its Silk Road ambition with China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). It will not only give an advantage to China, but also improve the South and Central Asian region economically. The BRI also has the potential to greatly assist Afghanistan in developing a sustainable economy and enabling it to become a vital trade and transit hub.

In Pakistan and Afghanistan, most observers see this as a primarily good step in improving the economics of South Asian and Central Asian countries.

For centuries, Afghanistan has served as a major cross-path along the ancient Silk Road. Its capital Kabul and cities like Balkh, Kandahar, Herat and several other cities of Afghanistan functioned as major transit hubs connecting the Western and Eastern worlds. Even though the Silk Road's importance waned in the 18th century, Afghanistan's parcel of land has become more convenient than ever.

With the assistance of regional allies, the Taliban administration should refocus its efforts on creating a new Silk Road in order to resurrect the country's potential as a vital junction. But first and foremost, their foreign policy approach should place a high priority on the building of hard infrastructure such as creating dams, improving farmland, developing irrigation systems, extracting precious metals and focusing on territorial border control management collaboration as well as regional and international socioeconomic cooperation agreements.

The report of the Regional Economic Cooperation Conference (RECC) on Afghanistan in 2016 highlights the country's tremendous progress in fulfilling its capability to reclaim its Silk Road status.

TAPI Project and Afghanistan's Comparative Advantage

Afghanistan is strategically positioned. It is a crossroads in Central Asia connecting China, South Asia and the Middle East. It was formerly a terra firma that functioned as a crossroads for civilizations using the famed Silk Road. Afghanistan's geo-strategic position is extremely significant now as it aims to return to its former status as an important land bridge.

Afghanistan's strategic position plays a vital role to connect energy-poor South Asia with energy-rich Central Asia, particularly due to the pressing demand for commerce and transit in these two rising economic hot spots. Afghanistan presents a unique passageway for energy commerce and transit that no other country can match, a value that has been acknowledged and underlined by the previous Afghan government, neighboring nations, and international organizations over the last decade. Central Asia has a gas and electricity surplus for which it needs a market. South Asia requires gas and power, especially in Pakistan and India, and their uncontrollable populations and vicinity make it a viable market for Central Asia's energy surplus.

The (RECC) meeting on Afghanistan, which began in 2007, is the most visible example of such initiatives. Afghanistan can expedite the transfer of energy between Central Asia and South Asia. In late 1980s, the notion of a Trans-Afghanistan Pipeline (TAPI) was introduced. It is now a top priority for South Asian countries Pakistan and India, as well as Turkmenistan. Similar natural gas transport projects exist such as the Turkmenistan¨CAfghanistan¨CPakistan Line and the Turkmenistan¨CUzbekistan¨CTajikistan¨CAfghanistan¨C Line, for which Afghanistan serves as the only transit route. Only time will tell if the Taliban will pay attention to such projects, which will be recognition of Afghanistan's location as a comparative advantage.

Taliban's stance on the BRI

Some policy pundits predict that the Taliban takeover might bring back the harsh realities of the past, but so far the Taliban are taking every step with caution and the world is watching a different Taliban mindset and approach. Recently, Taliban Spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid announced that Chinese assistance will build the foundation of Afghan development and China will be Afghanistan's ""main partner.""

""China will be our main partner and represents a great opportunity for us because it is ready to invest in our country and support reconstruction efforts,"" said spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid. He further said that the Taliban gives importance to China's BRI as the project will revive the ancient Silk Road. ""China will be our gateway to international markets,"" he added.

There are ""rich copper mines in the country, which, thanks to the Chinese, can be put back into operation and modernized. In addition, China is our pass to markets all over the world."" he added, ""The Taliban also view Russia as an important partner in the region and will maintain good relations with Moscow.""

Such positive remarks from the new Taliban government show their commitment and involvement with regional powers. They realize the importance of the BRI and want to fully engage to gain more benefits of Afghanistan's advantageous position of being at the crossroads of South Asia and Central Asia.

However, this commitment needs to be backed up by an inclusive political structure, prudent domestic and foreign policies, and resolute measures to crack down on terrorism so that China and other countries can safely invest in and cooperate with Afghanistan.

Otherwise, as research fellow David Sacks in the U.S. think-tank Council on Foreign Relations mentions, ""China is likely to be deterred from investing significant money in Afghanistan given the country's deteriorating security.""

"New chapter in Macao's development under 'One Country, Two Systems'","Editor's note: Alexandr Svetlicinii is an associate professor of law at the University of Macau, where he also serves as program coordinator for the Master of Laws English program in international business law. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

On September 5, 2021, China's central government released the Master Plan of the Development of the Guangdong-Macao Intensive Cooperation Zone in Hengqin. It is a milestone for the economic development of the Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR) under the ""One Country, Two Systems"" principle. This note highlights the major motives and objectives of the plan and explains its significance for Macao's economic diversification.

Macao's size (only 22 square kilometers) and its high reliance on the gaming industry for its revenues are two of the major impediments to the region's development. Aware of these limitations, the Communist Party of China Central Committee made a decision in 2009 to develop the island of Hengqin, which is adjacent to Macao and covers an area of more than 100 square kilometers, thus significantly expanding the prospects for Macao to diversify its economy with several nascent industries. Therefore, the Hengqin Cooperation Zone serves a dual purpose: the implementation of a larger development plan for the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area and diversification of Macao's economy.

First, the Master Plan highlights the functionality of the ""One Country, Two Systems"" model by experimenting with the joint governance model and approximation of the rules and regulations between Guangdong province and Macao SAR. For example, the campus of the University of Macau and the Hengqin Port, both physically located on Hengqin Island, will be administered by Macao authorities and Macao laws and regulations will be fully applied there.

Furthermore, the Hengqin Cooperation Zone will be managed by a joint administrative committee including public officials from Guangdong and Macao. To facilitate the circulation of goods between Macao and Hengqin, the Hengqin Cooperation Zone will have a two-tier customs clearance system: first-tier zone (adjacent to Macao) will allow duty-free importation of goods from Macao; the second-tier zone (adjacent to Zhuhai) will provide a one-time customs clearance so that the products could be further transported to the Chinese mainland."
BRICS nations face challenge and opportunity amid U.S. isolationism,"Editor's note: Freddie Reidy is a freelance writer based in London. He studied history and history of art at the University of Kent, Canterbury, specializing in Russian history and international politics. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

BRICS nations are due to meet virtually on September 9 for talks chaired by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The grouping comprised of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa is meeting at a time of significant global and regional challenge.

Nations across the globe continue to battle the COVID-19 pandemic and focus efforts on economic reconstruction. Meanwhile, the situation in Afghanistan poses specific security concerns, with three member states sharing regional interests and China also sharing a border.

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said that Afghanistan would be on the agenda for Thursday's summit and spoke of the commitment of BRICS to ""communication and coordination"" at an earlier fringe meeting of national security advisors.

On economic reconstruction, Alexi Gruzdev, the Russian deputy minister for trade and industry, said that there is ""no doubt the pandemic has greatly affected all sectors of the economy. It has become a serious challenge to global trade and relations, forcing national economies to rebuild supply chains and re-establish links.""

Part of the reconstruction effort relies heavily on vaccination and preventative measures, areas where China and Russia have led the group with their own vaccines as well as India's mass production of global vaccine options. Referring to this, Gruzdev praised the group's endeavors, saying ""the five BRICS countries have set an example of open international cooperation in terms of combating COVID-19.""

While vaccine production has been high within the group, attention will naturally turn to what additional support or expertise can be provided to nations that are struggling. Brazil, for example, has a death toll of 584,000, second only to the United States.

Beyond direct action over COVID-19, the BRICS group will also discuss the continued development of the group's multilateral institutions. On September 2, the Shanghai-based BRICS New Development Bank (NDB) welcomed its first non-BRICS members ¨C Bangladesh, the United Arab Emirates and Uruguay."
Iranian perspective of the Taliban's rise in Afghanistan,"Editor's note: Behzad Abdollahpour is a freelance writer and researcher at the Faculty of World Studies, University of Tehran. Currently, he is studying China Studies at Renmin University. The article reflects the author's views and not necessarily those of CGTN.

Iran and Afghanistan have had deep historical, cultural and economic relations. Geographically, Iran and Afghanistan share a 582-mile (936-km) border. The two countries have also enjoyed religious and linguistic affinities. For instance, approximately one-fifth of the population in Afghanistan consists of the Shiite Hazara community. Most Hazaras, like Iranians, are Shiite and speak a dialect of Persian.

From an economic perspective, Afghanistan is considered the largest destination for Iran's non-oil exports and the source of hard currency, especially American dollars which could affect the fluctuations in Iran's foreign currency market.

Furthermore, Afghanistan is considered by Iran as a conduit for supplying oil and gas to China, India, Japan and other countries situated in South Asia and East Asia that have economic ties with Iran. Hence, the transformation in Afghanistan is important for Iran which can directly or indirectly influence its foreign and domestic policies in the region or beyond.

Tehran seeks to play a significant role in establishing peace and security in its neighboring country. On the one hand, since the dimensions of transformation in Afghanistan are not clear to Iran, Tehran is dubious about how to approach a Taliban-controlled Afghanistan. On the other hand, up until now Iran has sought to maintain its ties with the central government and all political parties in Afghanistan including the Taliban and find a middle ground to appease all sides in order to defuse the tensions which have existed over the past two decades.

Iran's consistent policy regarding Afghanistan during these years was U.S. withdrawal from the country and it hosted intra-Afghan peace meetings in Tehran to reach an agreement between Afghan participants to try to establish a comprehensive peace with the participation of all parties. Now with the U.S. withdrawal and swift control of the Taliban over almost all parts of Afghanistan, this question arises that how would Iran deal with the rise of the Taliban?

Recognizing Taliban or not?

The swift takeover of Afghanistan shocked most countries, including Iran. After September 11, the existence of a ""common enemy""¨C the United States of America, drew the two sides close to each other, but now without the U.S. presence in Afghanistan, there is lingering doubt about their future ties and strategies towards each other.

The Taliban, among Iranian media, authorities and elites, symbolize ""good"" or ""bad"" Taliban. That's why we can receive mixed and unclear signals from the Iranian authorities regarding recognizing or not recognizing it as the legitimate government of the Afghan people."
Joe Biden's Afghan nightmare,"U.S. President Joe Biden gestures as he gives remarks on the worsening situation in Afghanistan from the East Room of the White House, Washington, D.C., U.S., August 16, 2021. /CFP

U.S. President Joe Biden gestures as he gives remarks on the worsening situation in Afghanistan from the East Room of the White House, Washington, D.C., U.S., August 16, 2021. /CFP

Editor's note: Elizabeth Drew is a Washington-based journalist and the author, most recently, of ""Washington Journal: Reporting Watergate and Richard Nixon's Downfall."" The article reflects the author's views and not necessarily those of CGTN.

It is far from clear that President Joe Biden deserves the obloquy heaped on him for the U.S. evacuation from Afghanistan. This is especially true given the endings of other American wars, and the nearly impossible situation confronting him ¨C in particular, that the Kabul airport is located within a city of millions which had just come under Taliban control.

The repetitive airing of scenes of panicked Afghans clinging to C-17 cargo planes after this was no longer happening made for far more dramatic scenes than the smooth take-offs that followed during the next 17 days of evacuation, yet news programs kept rerunning those chaotic images, creating an impression of Biden as hapless. Yet, some 120,000 U.S. people ¨C including troops of U.S. allies as well as Afghans who had helped the U.S. cause ¨C were evacuated by air from Kabul, a logistical triumph.

Since Biden chose to end the evacuation by August 31, the date he had set, a few hundred Americans ¨C some not ready to depart, many unable to reach Kabul airport ¨C as well as hundreds of Afghans who had worked with the United States, were left behind. (A few have been evacuated since.) But Biden faced only bad choices. Had he prolonged America's presence, U.S. troops and those of allies would have been put at more risk, especially from the murderous Islamic State (ISIS) offshoot that had begun a campaign of suicide bombings.

The retreat from Afghanistan has revealed much about the nature of the government that Biden is running and how he runs it. Although Donald Trump ¨C who also wanted to get out of Afghanistan ¨C left Biden with an unworkable settlement with the Taliban, Biden's decisions on withdrawal were mostly buttressed by his long-held belief that, when al-Qaeda was driven out of Afghanistan and Osama bin Laden killed, America's strategic needs had been met.

Despite his deep convictions about the correctness of his decisions, Biden brought trouble on himself by offering cheery predictions ¨C such as that the Afghan government wouldn't fall any time soon. When that proved unrealistic, Biden became defensive, even belligerent, which dented his reputation as a nice guy.

Another factor that may have played a role in shaping Biden's Afghan policy is the striking difference in the nature of the president's foreign and defense policy team and his domestic policy advisers. The latter is comprised of former mayors, governors, members of congress, and at least one business executive ¨C people of independent standing. But Biden's national security team is dominated by former aides.

The soft-spoken Secretary of State Antony Blinken is a loyal, longtime Biden adviser. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, a youthful-looking 44, was Biden's national security adviser as vice president. Biden often cites the concurrence of his advisers as confirmation of the wisdom of his decisions, but one gets the strong impression that he makes clear to them what advice he wants.

Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin does carry an aura of independence and gravitas. Austin speaks slowly and carefully, and with that authority that comes almost naturally to a former four-star U.S. Army general. He projects confidence without drama, and holds his views tight. A senator said, ""I wouldn't want to play poker with him.""

Austin managed the draw-down of American troops in Iraq, where he had worked closely with the president's deceased son Beau, both qualifications that undoubtedly stood him well with the president. (Biden's continuing, and maudlin, invocations of Beau, occasionally at truly awkward moments, is beginning to worry even some of his close allies.)"
Washington Post points at something sinister in Wuhan yet again,"Editor's note: Anthony Moretti is an associate professor at the Department of Communication and Organizational Leadership, Robert Morris University. The article reflects the author's views and not necessarily those of CGTN.

Just when you thought the Western media might be growing tired of telling stories about the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV), along comes the Washington Post to ruin your day.

The newspaper delivered this heart-pounding headline to a report it circulated on September 7: ""Inside the Wuhan lab: French engineering, deadly viruses and a big mystery.""

According to the four reporters who created this latest fairy tale about the institute that Western media are convinced houses deep, dark secrets about the origins of the coronavirus: ""Not everything there was meant for public eyes. Asked in 2018 what kind of viruses they kept by a reporter for the state-run Guangzhou Daily, the P4 lab's deputy director, Song Donglin, replied that 'disclosure of this kind of information must be controlled.' WIV management has reminded staffers for years about state-secrets requirements and to be wary of foreign spies.""

I defy these same reporters to walk up to scientists at the most elite labs in the U.S. and demand to know what viruses are under examination inside those walls. Good luck getting an answer to that question. Oh, and those reporters should anticipate that some governmental agency would likely want to have a chat with them.

Put another way: If U.S. scientists refuse to provide such information, they are honestly engaging in protecting vital national security interests. But when Chinese scientists do the same thing, they are hiding something.

How simple, how nonsensical and how littered with bias.

The Washington Post story then attempts to undermine the credibility of one of the scientists working inside the Wuhan lab. The reporters suggest the scientist ""feared that the virus could have come from her lab,"" but later that same scientist became ""adamant that the WIV never crossed paths with the virus, saying that she checked the lab records and that all staffers tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.""

""Adamant."" That is a polite way of saying the scientist dared to do what scientists should do -- verify their research -- and then came up with a response Western media did not approve of.

Mind you, an Australian virologist who was working alongside the Chinese team in Wuhan in late 2019 has said very much the same thing about the integrity of the research taking place in Wuhan and about the absence of any illnesses."
Assessing the Taliban's interim government appointments,"Editor's note: Andrew Korybko is a Moscow-based American political analyst. The article reflects the author's views and not necessarily those of CGTN.

The Taliban announced its acting government on September 7, with some of its members being sanctioned by the United Nations Security Council (UNSC). Mullah Mohammad Hassan Akhund will serve as acting prime minister, Amir Khan Muttaqi as acting foreign minister, and Sarajuddin Haqqani as acting interior minister, the latter of whom has a $5 million bounty on him by the U.S. This makes it unlikely that many countries will formally recognize the new de facto authorities despite the group earlier saying that it wants relations with everyone, except Israel.

It's been a roller-coaster ride for the Taliban after it previously swept to power in 1996 but was then militarily deposed by the U.S. shortly after the 9/11 terrorist attacks in late 2001. The group's prior rule of the country was characterized by its strict implementation of Sharia, also known as Islamic Law. Most controversially, they also provided sanctuary to al-Qaeda chief Osama Bin Laden, who the U.S. blamed for the 9/11 terrorist attacks. The Taliban denied the existence of any evidence linking him to the attacks and recently reiterated that claim.

Nevertheless, not only were they overthrown by the Americans, but they and their supporters were ruthlessly hunted down by the occupying coalition for nearly two decades. The international community regarded them as terrorists due to their ties with al-Qaeda and other terrorist groups despite the Taliban itself never plotting any foreign attacks against America or any other country. They did, however, resort to unconventional warfare against the occupying forces and their local allies through roadside bombs, suicide attacks and other means.

On the other hand, the U.S. and its allied Afghan National Army (ANA) would often carry out bombings or even nighttime special forces raids against suspected Taliban members that killed many civilians over the years. This greatly contributed to the collateral damage that they recklessly carried out throughout the course of their ""nation-building"" campaign and which ultimately led to many average Afghans beginning to see the Taliban as the so-called lesser evil. Even though they were strict, they weren't corrupt and they valued law and order.

The Taliban gradually transformed itself from the terrorist group that many observers considered it to be to a national liberation movement in the eyes of the Afghan people, primarily the approximately three-quarters who live in rural areas and suffered most under the occupation. They also broadened their ranks beyond their Pashtun base by including minorities such as the Tajiks in leadership positions. With time, the Taliban cut its ties with terrorists and entered into political talks with the U.S. and others as part of the Afghan peace process."
U.S. risks becoming an unreliable partner in fighting future pandemics,"Editor's note: Adriel Kasonta is a London-based foreign affairs analyst and commentator. He is the founder of AK Consultancy and former chairman of the International Affairs Committee at Bow Group, the oldest conservative think tank in the UK. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

Ever since the COVID-19 pandemic began, the U.S. government has already decided about its origins. The virus, as first argued by then President Donald Trump and pushed by then Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, was believed to be the product of the Chinese government's malicious intent and a potential bio-weapon produced to harm the ""free world.""

Although the U.S. intelligence community on April 30, 2020, issued a statement that it ""concurs with the wide scientific consensus that the COVID-19 virus was not manmade or genetically modified,"" once the ""China virus"" propaganda was spread, it managed to harbor a seed of doubt in the global consciousness, giving rise to extreme Sinophobia both at home and abroad.

Despite pinning high hopes on President Joe Biden to break with the destructive practices of stigmatization cherished by his predecessor, the new commander-in-chief decided to ask the intelligence community on May 26 to ""redouble their efforts"" within 90 days in hopes of finding a ""definitive conclusion"" about the coronavirus origins amid growing attention to the so-called lab-leak hypothesis.

The report published late August from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, which oversees the nation's 18 spy agencies, informed that the conducted investigation was inconclusive and unable to unequivocally declare if the pandemic resulted from a laboratory accident or human contact with an infected animal.

""All agencies assess that two hypotheses are plausible: natural exposure to an infected animal and a laboratory-associated incident,"" the report reads. Those were the same two hypotheses the U.S. intelligence community had ""coalesced around"" earlier this year before Biden asked agencies to conduct the most recent investigation.

What is the most important about this new review, even though it may not have settled the fundamental question of where the virus emerged, is the fact that intelligence agencies were able ""to reach broad agreement on several other key issues,"" including the judgment that ""the virus was not developed as a biological weapon"" and ""China's officials did not have foreknowledge of the virus before the initial outbreak of COVID-19 emerged ¨C the two most outrageous and undignifying accusations leveled by the U.S. against Beijing.

It is also worth mentioning that while the joint WHO-China study of origins of SARS-CoV-2 published on March 30 concluded that the virus was most likely transmitted from bats to humans and that it was ""extremely unlikely"" that it escaped from the lab, a group of 13 U.S.-friendly countries raised concern over this investigation's independence, citing delays and a lack of full access to data."
All eyes on what the Afghan 'Islamic Emirate' will do next,"Editor's note: CGTN's First Voice provides instant commentary on breaking stories. The daily column clarifies emerging issues and better defines the news agenda, offering a Chinese perspective on the latest global events.

On September 8, the Taliban announced an acting government in Afghanistan and proceeded to appoint Mullah Mohammad Hassan Akhunda as the prime minister of the government.

Speaking to global media at a press conference, a spokesman said the Taliban want ""strong and healthy relations with our neighbors and all other countries based on mutual respect and interaction"" and vowed to respect international laws and treaties provided they ""are not in conflict with Islamic law and the country's national values.""

Afghanistan has spent almost all of its contemporary history as a deeply broken and divided country. Unending struggles between various sectarian, ethnic and tribal groups have revolved around a lack of consensus as to who should run the country, and in turn, most of its governments have struggled because they lacked underlying political legitimacy. Be it the Soviet-backed state of the 1980s or the U.S.-backed state that just collapsed, the perpetual crisis of Afghanistan is vested in an inability to create stable, inclusive and trusted institutions that meet the needs of all its people.

The Taliban, after a 20-year hiatus, are now back in power. They claim that this time ""it will be different,"" and the burden of proof is on them to demonstrate such. While America's two-decade crusade and ideological experiment was a horrific, costly and unproductive mistake, the Taliban must illustrate to the world that they are a legitimate, capable and reasoned government that is ready to represent, safeguard and uphold the interests of all of its people, as well as becoming a mature and reliable actor within the international community. The mistakes of the past must be learned. The Taliban must demonstrate that it will not facilitate international terrorism and instability."

Editor's note: Keith Lamb is a University of Oxford graduate with an MSc degree in Contemporary Chinese Studies. His primary research interests are China's international relations and ""socialism with Chinese characteristics."" The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

In my previous article, I talked about the liberal elite, a transnational capitalist class that primarily arose from merging the North American and Western European national bourgeoisie. Their neoliberal ideology advocates for their undemocratic control of the world's resources through privatization, and their human rights ideology is used to mask their neocolonial invasions, which acts as another revenue stream for them.

While Afghanistan provided an all-you-can-eat 20-year buffet of destruction for the liberal capital's military-industrial complex, it also worked as a way to disrupt the development of the Global South.

When it comes to the interests of the transnational liberal elite, they marry their human rights wars with their strategic interests. The occupation of Afghanistan, in the heart of Asia, established a zone of instability, threatening any state attempting to develop inland.

Since the industrialization and development of the West, the majority of the Global South still remains poor. This is not a natural state of affairs. Neither is it, as shown by China's development, a product of not accepting liberal democracy and neoliberal economics, which often impoverishes states. In fact, the status-quo of development for the few has been central to maintaining liberal capital's hegemony.

Both pre-WWII colonialism and the post-war neoliberal order have stripped the Global South of its wealth. This is no surprise considering the transnational liberal elite of today are, primarily, an amalgamation of former colonial powers and their settler colonies. Their hegemony today, as in the past, depends largely on power projection through the sea lanes. Indeed, it was naval superiority that allowed the West to subjugate the entire world.

In contrast, all inland development, away from their main lines of control, is a threat to their hegemony. For example, inland development threatens their control over trade and their ability to embargo others. Needless to say, development projects like the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), which also includes sea lanes, must be countered as the democratic development of the Global South would challenge their hegemony.

From this perspective, Afghanistan wasn't just a win for liberal capital, which profits from war. Its destruction also left a zone of chaos and a Western military presence to threaten developmental cooperation among Central Asian states and China. Both China and Russia are major adversaries of Western liberalism because these large continental-sized states have a greater capacity for inland development away from Western naval power projection.

With this in mind, the audacious Afghanistan gambit isn't over and formal withdrawal represents just a repositioning of the pieces."
The Gulf odyssey is also about satisfying U.S. geopolitical objectives,"Editor's note: Hamzah Rifaat Hussain, former visiting fellow at the Stimson Center in Washington and former assistant researcher at the Islamabad Policy Research Institute, is a TV anchor at Indus News in Pakistan. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

The visit by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin to the Middle East this week is purportedly an attempt to champion America's Afghanistan diplomacy which has otherwise been in complete disarray. Key allies in the Gulf such as Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates will be briefed on U.S. efforts to thwart resurgent threats from armed groups in the country despite the pronounced presence of ISIS-K in the country.

Contradictions aside, both Austin and Blinken will also be assuring Gulf States that the withdrawal plan is linked to an increased focus on security challenges from China and Russia which does not equate to the abandonment of traditional allies. Like U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris's visit to South East Asia however, this will once again be met with little traction.

Firstly, there is a complete lack of clarity as to what such assurances actually mean. By vacillating between Afghan diplomacy on the one hand to propping up the Moscow and Beijing threat on the other, the Biden administration is once again attempting to relay U.S. foreign policy priorities to the region which has traditionally shunned away from such directives for something more substantial.

Take Qatar, for example, where a close relationship with the United States has not prevented Doha from forging a strategic relationship with Iran despite U.S. aversion. Yet Washington, D.C. still expects its allies to toe its line by denouncing China and Russia as legitimate security threats which is both impractical and belies actual dynamics that underpin bilateral relationships between the two sides.

Secondly, similar to Kamala Harris' trip to South East Asia, U.S. military priorities will not be shared by the Gulf States despite amicable ties. Geopolitical adventurism in a region defined by turmoil in Syria, Yemen and Iraq is simply not an option.

Furthermore, neither China nor Russia is considered an existential threat in any of the capitals with much of the threat perceptions centering on Iran's expansionism and that too in just a few Gulf States. Yet alliance building and mustering up support to cater to parochial interests are continuing as a matter of state policy.

For example, the U.S. has had a military footprint in Bahrain for decades but by promoting its threat perception narrative, it is aiming to leverage the presence of the Navy's Fifth Fleet based in Bahrain for state endorsement of anti-China and anti-Russia doctrines. Yet contrary to such aspirations, China and Russia are not strategic challenges to Manama, the region or the globe and heightened military presence in the Gulf will not change this undeniable reality."
Breaking bad bond buying,"Editor's note: Andr¨¦s Velasco, former presidential candidate and finance minister of Chile, is dean of the School of Public Policy at the London School of Economics and Political Science.

In the run-up to the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City's annual symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, last month, the discussion had focused on whether monetary policy should be tightened in response to higher U.S. inflation. By suggesting that asset purchases would be tapered first, and that interest-rate increases would come much later, Fed Chair Jerome Powell has shifted the conversation to the question of how policy should be tightened.

While printing money to buy bonds and reduce long-term interest rates is justified during crises like those in 2008 or 2020, the case for maintaining quantitative easing (QE) in more tranquil times is far from obvious. To see why, it helps to dispel three misconceptions about QE.

The first misconception is that QE is a monetary policy. It is not. Or rather, it is not just that. It is also a fiscal policy. In every country, the central bank is owned by the treasury. When the Fed issues money ¨C central bank reserves, in fact ¨C to buy a government bond, the private sector is getting one government liability in exchange for another.

The second misconception is that the government (including the treasury and central bank) always comes out ahead from such a transaction, because the private sector is left holding a security that pays a lower rate of interest. That need not be so. Central bank reserves can be held only by commercial banks, which have limited use for them. To induce banks to hold more reserves, central bankers must pay interest on them, as the Fed and the Bank of England started doing in response to the 2008 financial crisis.

The third misconception is that whenever the interest rate on central bank reserves is zero or lower than the rate on government bonds, the government can spend what it pleases, when it pleases. This is the central tenet of so-called Modern Monetary Theory. It is pithy, spiffy, snazzy, and wrong.

Yes, financing from money creation (economists call it seigniorage) is feasible whenever the yield on money is below that of government bonds. But as the central bank prints more and more money, it must pay higher and higher interest rates on that money to ensure that commercial banks and the public will want to hold it. Sooner or later, the interest-rate gap closes and there is no more seigniorage to be had. If the central bank keeps printing money beyond this point, the private sector will begin dumping it, causing currency depreciation, inflation, or both.

Once one accepts these three provisos, one must ask the multi-trillion-dollar question: Does QE make sense, from a fiscal point of view, in the United States today? The answer is no, for at least two reasons.

In late August 2021, the Fed was paying 0.15 percent interest on commercial banks' reserve balances at a time when the interest rate on short-maturity Treasury bills was oscillating around 0.04 percent. That means it is cheaper (for the U.S. taxpayer) to finance expenditures by issuing bonds than by printing money."
Enabling nature-based solutions crucial to tackling planetary crisis,"Editor's note: Decision Makers is a global platform for decision makers to share their insights on events shaping today's world. Marco Lambertini is Director General of WWF International. Manuel Pulgar-Vidal is WWF's Global Leader of Climate and Energy and Chair of its Nature-based Solutions Steering Committee. The article reflects the authors' opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

Humanity's current development model based on burning fossil fuels and converting natural ecosystems for agriculture is changing the climate, degrading once-productive lands and driving plant and animal species to extinction. It's no coincidence that millions of people are affected each year by the direct consequences of poverty, lack of clean water or adequate nutrition, extreme weather, and exposure to new virulent pests and diseases.

Centuries of over-exploitation has perpetuated a sense that humanity is somehow distant and disconnected from nature. In reality, we are deeply dependent on nature's health to safeguard our own. We now have more and better knowledge of how to work with nature's potential through an aligned understanding, effective undertaking and scaled implementation of an extremely powerful concept: nature-based solutions.

Our new ""Powering Nature"" report interrogates the most prevalent issues blocking our collective ability to unlock nature's potential and proposes ways in which nature-based solutions can have a profound impact on our future.

1. Transforming food systems

Taking a nature-positive approach to transforming food systems catalyzes the shift to more sustainable and productive lands. Rehabilitating degraded agricultural land and sustainably managing existing productive lands generates higher crop yields, better nutritional quality and greater food security at local and global levels.

2. Ecological connectivity

Ecological connectivity is crucial to ensure resilient landscapes that can deliver benefits for people and nature, yet this connectivity is being rapidly eroded as natural habitats are fragmented by agriculture, infrastructure, extractives and other uses. Nature-based solutions are the ideal approach to counter this and the benefits of nature-based solutions can be magnified if they are deployed.

3. Flood risk reduction

We need to restore floodplain ecosystems. In river systems worldwide, floodplains are being reconnected and allowed to flood, rather than relying solely on engineered structures such as dams, dikes and floodwalls. Biodiversity is enhanced through the restoration of floodplain ecosystems, which are among the most productive in the world.

4. An ocean of opportunity

Around the world, low-lying small islands and coastal areas are demonstrating the value of protecting ""green infrastructure"" for increasing resilience to flooding and coastal erosion. Halting and reversing the decline of coastal habitats offers an opportunity for the large-scale application of nature-based solutions.

5. Climate-smart

A smart approach to nature-based solutions builds in resilience to different possible futures in a changing climate. In practice, that means asking questions like ""will the benefits of protecting these mangroves disappear with rising seas? Does planting regenerative crops in one place make sense if the soil becomes drier, wetter or saltier with time?"""
Who's really to blame for the Taliban-U.S. 'hostage crisis'?,"Editor's note: Andrew Korybko is a Moscow-based American political analyst. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily those of CGTN.

The top Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee provocatively claimed that the Taliban are holding Americans and some Afghans ""hostage"" by allegedly not allowing six planes to depart from the country. Representative Michael McCaul said, ""We know the reason why, [it] is because the Taliban want something in exchange,"" which he speculated is ""full recognition from the United States of America."" Some of the Americans involved in private evacuation efforts there, however, told Fox News that the State Department is to blame.

The outlet quoted an unnamed American who told them, ""It is not the Taliban that is holding this up ¨C as much as it sickens me to say that ¨C it is the United States government."" Fox News wrote that ""the individual suggested that the State Department's obstruction is motivated in part by embarrassment that private individuals are rescuing Americans that the U.S. government left behind."" According to them, they haven't yet received permission from the State Department to land in nearby countries like Qatar.

Rick Clay, who Fox News described as heading the private evacuation group PlanB, ""turned to senators from both parties: Sens. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., and Ron Johnson, R-Wis., have all sought to help PlanB and other organizations secure the approval they need to get the evacuees safely out of Afghanistan, organizers and Senate staffers told Fox News."" He apparently did this ""after making little to no progress with the State Department.""

These contrasting claims make it difficult to attribute blame for what McCaul described as the ongoing ""hostage situation"" and raise questions about whether that's even the appropriate term to describe what's happening. The Associated Press' report adds another twist to this story. The outlet wrote that ""at least 10 families were seen at a local hotel waiting"" and ""others were seen at restaurants"" after an unnamed Afghan official told them that ""the sticking point ... is that many did not have the right travel papers."""
Is this NATO's arms control logic?,"Spain's Mendez Nunez navy frigate docks near the Eminonu port following joint NATO naval exercises in Istanbul, Turkey, April 3, 2021. /Getty Spain's Mendez Nunez navy frigate docks near the Eminonu port following joint NATO naval exercises in Istanbul, Turkey, April 3, 2021. /Getty

Editor's note: Hannan Hussain is a foreign affairs commentator and author. He is a Fulbright recipient at the University of Maryland, U.S., and a former assistant researcher at the Islamabad Policy Research Institute. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN. On September 6, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg delivered a speech at the 17th Annual NATO Conference on Arms Control, Disarmament and Weapons of Mass Destruction Non-Proliferation, where an already sensitive narrative on global cooperative security stood challenged by the West's growing preference for ideology.

""A world where NATO Allies have given up their nuclear deterrent, while Russia, China or countries like (the) DPRK retain their nuclear weapons, is simply not a safer world,"" alleged Stoltenberg. But the erroneous depiction of China's nuclear strategy as particularly concerning, and the broader conjecture that Beijing is on the verge of proliferation, strike at the heart of a larger truth: that NATO's flagging credibility as a guarantor of Euro-Atlantic security will seek mileage anywhere. Stoltenberg is at odds with reality to claim that China's nuclear arsenal is both ""rapidly expanding"" and marked by a ""complete lack of transparency."" What that line of argument largely ignores is Beijing's well-established support for feasible armaments transparency measures both within its borders and globally. Moreover, China has scored those efforts through its continued advocacy for an approach to nuclear transparency that resonates with assured security for all states, challenging the basis for Beijing's verification metrics on nuclear disarmament and arms control being lax in NATO's books. More critically, it is these strategic rationales that identify a fracture in Stoltenberg's play on facts: that Beijing's consistent, no-first use nuclear weapons calculus is somehow designed to beef-up nuclear capabilities to the contrary, and remains active ""without any limitation or constraint."" If such hypotheses were to be entertained in the name of arms control logic, global confidence in nuclear security would wane faster than NATO's presumed cohesion in its so-called 2030 transatlantic security agenda. On advancing international legal instruments for nuclear risk reduction, NATO must first take a hard look at some of its own ranks. Washington, hell-bent on projecting China as its top nuclear threat, has been moving the goalposts on what strategic nuclear deterrence ¨C a gateway to controlling conflict ¨C should look like.

1992 Consensus should not be used as a mere slogan for votes,"Editor's note: Zhou Wenxing is a research fellow at Huazhi Institute for Global Governance, Nanjing University and former Asia fellow at John F. Kennedy School of Government, Harvard University. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily those of CGTN.

The election for leadership of the Kuomintang (KMT) is currently being held in China's Taiwan region. Four candidates, including incumbent chairman Johnny Chiang, former chairman Eric Chu, former Changhua County magistrate Cho Po-yuan, and president of the NGO Sun Yat-sen School Chang Ya-chung are vying for the party's leadership. Since the chairmanship will be directly related to the regional leadership election of Taiwan in 2024, the election is viewed of great importance and drawing wide attention.

During the televised chairmanship election debate held last Saturday, the four candidates all regarded cross-Strait relations as a crucial issue on their agenda and advocated for ""breaking the ice"" with the Chinese mainland as well as restoring peaceful and stable development of relations across the Taiwan Straits maintained by the Ma Ying-jeou Administration from 2008 to 2016. They also pointed out the root cause of the current political deadlock in cross-Strait ties and provided adequate advice on how to establish a good relationship with the mainland based on the 1992 Consensus and avoid becoming a pawn of the U.S.

Admittedly, as the candidates argued, Tsai Ing-wen, since her election as the leader of Taiwan region in 2016, has not only refused to recognize the 1992 Consensus but also sought to collude with external forces to confront the mainland. The ongoing political stalemate on cross-Strait relations over the past five years is indeed the direct result of Tsai authorities' problematic mainland policy.

In this context, as the largest opposition party on the Taiwan island, the KMT is expected to undertake the due obligations to address the dilemma across the Taiwan Straits.

However, Johnny Chiang, the current leader and a representative of the young generation in the party, didn't reaffirm the 1992 Consensus after assuming office in 2020 until recently. His disregard for the Consensus largely led to a debate within the party on whether the cross-Strait policies, including the Consensus, which had been recognized by Ma authorities, should be adjusted."
Central European countries are stress-testing the EU,"Editor's note: Bradley Blankenship is a Prague-based American journalist, political analyst and freelance reporter. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily those of CGTN.

Yet again, the European Union is facing an uncertain future that could see member states retract from Brussels as the clash between national and bloc-level law intensifies.

In the past several days, the EU has issued warnings to Poland and the Czech Republic that EU funds may be withheld due to a variety of concerns, while both Poland and Hungary's national pandemic recovery plans have yet to even be approved.

In the case of Poland, the EU is threatening about $150 million in cohesion funds from some provinces over ""LGBT-ideology free zones,"" which have fueled discrimination though do not have any clear legal designation.

As far as pandemic-related aid is concerned, both Poland and Hungary have yet to have their plans endorsed by the EU finance ministers over rule of law concerns. Among the concerns are alleged misuse of funds, though certainly other member states are concerned about threats to civil society and general EU norms.

So bad is the situation in Hungary apparently that economist Daron Acemoglu recently argued for Hungary's outright expulsion from the EU while setting its sights on Poland. ""The longer the EU continues to treat Hungary like a normal democracy, the more damage it will do to its own brand,"" he concluded.

More recently, both countries refused to sign on with the newly established European Public Prosecutor's Office (EPPO) that is designed to investigate and prosecute crimes involving EU funds, raising concerns over the primacy of EU law and the transparency of funds.

Similarly, in the Czech Republic, although the country's national recovery plan was endorsed by EU finance ministers, funds may be withheld because the country has failed to shore up its lack of proper conflict of interest controls.

On August 30, it was reported that the European Commission had issued a stern warning to the Czech Republic that such subsidies might be withheld if conditions weren't met.

The warning specifically asks the Czech authorities to compile a list of all public officials that control companies, plus any trust funds and their recipients, as well as any subsidies they may have received by September 8. Just two days before the deadline, the government asked for a postponement, admitting that it failed to address conflict of interest concerns in time.

Of course, this falls in the context of a previous conclusion of an audit by the commission published in April that found Prime Minister Andrej Babis still maintained effective control of his business conglomerate, Agrofert, and thus has conflict of interest."
Dialogue with Moin ul Haque: Pakistan's Position over Taliban Takeover,"Editor's note: As a close neighbor of Afghanistan and a victim of America's ""War on Terror"", what's Pakistan's stance towards the Taliban's takeover? How would Pakistan respond to Western claims that ""Pakistan has been supporting the Taliban throughout""? Moin ul Haque, the Ambassdor of Pakistan to China, talks with CGTN anchor Wang Guan.

Wang Guan: Ambassador Moin ul Haque. Great to see you again. Let's talk about the security situation in Afghanistan. The U.S. troops completely withdrew on August 31st. What is Pakistan's position towards the Taliban takeover?

Ambassador Moin ul Haque: We are relieved that this takeover by Taliban of Kabul happened without any action, without any violence, or a civil war, which was being predicted earlier. We would have hoped that the withdrawal of the U.S. troops could have been more responsible and orderly and have been synchronized with the political process and the peace talks that have been going on. Unfortunately, that has not happened. Pakistan's position is very clear. From all along we have been saying that there is no military solution to the Afghan conflict. Our Prime Minister Imran Khan has said that multiple times. There's only a political process, a political settlement that has to be Afghan-led, Afghan-owned. We are the direct beneficiary of peace and stability in Afghanistan. We have suffered a lot because of these two decades or rather four decades of conflict in Afghanistan. So Pakistan desires a peaceful settlement of this long, long conflict and we hope that all parties, people of Afghanistan and the political factions in Afghanistan will take this historic opportunity to go through a charter of future for them.

Wang Guan: Will Pakistan recognize the new Taliban government?

Ambassador: It is very premature to say at this stage, as I said, that we are waiting for the formation of the government, what the contours it will be. On that basis, we would like to coordinate our position with our regional partners, especially China and other neighboring countries. We hope that we'll be able to build a regional consensus for the recognition of a future Afghan government.

Wang Guan: Not everyone in the West understands this or fully appreciates this, but Pakistan suffered more casualties than most, if not all countries, since the so called ""War on Terror"" began 20 years ago. And Pakistan and Afghanistan shares a long border, over 2,000 kilometers. According to the United Nations, as many as half a million people could flee Afghanistan in the future. Many of them will head to Pakistan. Help us understand the security stakes for Pakistan and how may Pakistan deal with the influx of refugees?

Ambassador: We are really disappointed by, again, this kind of narrative that is coming out from some of the countries to scapegoat Pakistan, to blame Pakistan. You can't blame the victim. Pakistan has been victim of these four decades of instability and conflict in our region in Afghanistan. And Pakistan, as you mentioned, the refugee issue, Pakistan has been the largest refugee hosting nation in the world. After the first Afghan War in the 80s and the 90s, Pakistan has hosted close to 5 million Afghan refugees. Still, today we have 3 million Afghan refugees in our country which we have provided. We have welcomed them, we have opened our hearts and homes for our foreign brothers and sisters. We have provided them shelter. We have provided them the food, education, health, their livelihoods. They're still there. So far, I think there is, in my view, there is no need for any panic, because the situation in Kabul and other parts of the country remain relatively calm. We would like the Afghan people to be in their country, to be part of a nation-building process. Many of the Afghan nationals who are experts, who are engineers, who would be required to run the government, to run different companies and institutions. We do also hope that in the future, there would be a time, a period that refugees in Pakistan and elsewhere could return to Afghanistan with dignity and respect.

Wang Guan: Mister ambassador, there is also a narrative in the West saying that Pakistan is somehow happy to see the Taliban takeover because they claim that the Pakistani military has been somehow nurturing the Afghan Taliban for decades. And what do you think of that narrative?

Ambassador: I think this narrative, as I mentioned earlier, people should stop blaming Pakistan for what is happening in Afghanistan. Pakistan has been a victim, as I mentioned earlier. We have suffered close to 70,000 lives of Pakistani nationals, including our security nationals in this ""War of Terror"". This was not our war. We were sucked into this. Now, to blame Pakistan for this is very unfortunate. We would like the international community to understand, to learn from its past mistakes, because if you don't learn, draw lessons, then there is always a high cost to pay. I hope that the international community would recognize that, will remain engaged with the new government in Kabul, will help the people of Afghanistan for their reconstruction and economic development, and not repeat the past mistakes.

Wang Guan: What do you think are the common interests between China and Pakistan? What can China and Pakistan do together to coordinate their policies regarding the future of Afghanistan and the security future?

Ambassador: As a neighbor of Afghanistan, the interests about China and Pakistan converge. We have similar views about the future of Afghanistan: peace and stability of Afghanistan, the economic future of Afghanistan and its people, the rebuilding and reconstruction of Afghanistan. Recently, in Chengdu our foreign minister had the session, the third session of the strategic dialogue, where the issue of Afghanistan was discussed in detail. It was last month. At that time, these developments have not taken place. But at the time, also, we had given a very strong message that the two countries would like peace and stability of Afghanistan and a government which takes into account the interest of all ethnic groups in Afghanistan. Moving forward, the two countries can help in the reconstruction of Afghanistan. As you know, we have also agreed that China-Pakistan Economic Corridor could be extended to Afghanistan.

Wang Guan: Do you think that the Taliban would welcome that gesture to extend CPEC into Afghanistan?

Ambassador: Definitely, I think they have already given statements in welcoming the role of China for the future development of Afghanistan. And they've also welcomed Pakistan's role in this process. We really see that any future government in Kabul would like to have engagement with its neighbors, with international community, especially Pakistan and China, for its economic needs and its development needs.

20-year invasion and war end. What's next?,"Despite terrorist attack and retaliatory airstrikes in Kabul, the U.S. announced the completion of its evacuation operations in Afghanistan. The chaos caused by the rush to withdraw troops has generated criticism of the Biden administration both at home and abroad.

What will the U.S. do in response to the pending post-deadline crisis in Afghanistan? And can the Taliban prevent Afghanistan from becoming the hotbed of terrorism?

He is the author of many papers and books related to economics. His current interests lie in global development and Sino-U.S. links, especially trade, financial and technological issues.

The United States Climate Envoy John Kerry visited China last week to meet his Chinese counterpart Xie Zhenhua in the lead-up to the COP 26 UN Climate Change Conference to be held in November in the United Kingdom. It's Kerry's second trip to China this year as U.S. climate envoy.

Kerry's visit to China shows that the U.S. has a positive attitude to join hands with China to find solutions to the urgent global crisis. It is much appreciated that Mr. Kerry has confirmed America's willingness to work with China to enhance dialogue, jointly improve ambitions, demonstrate leadership, and set an example for meeting the Paris Agreement goals, given the importance of U.S.-China cooperation for responding to the pressing challenge of climate change.

He also highlighted that U.S.-China cooperation on climate change will create opportunities for addressing difficulties facing U.S.-China relations.

Nevertheless, Kerry's visit was a continuation of the U.S. use of climate change politics to constrain China's development needs even though China is sincere in tackling climate change and has taken environmental responsibility to new heights.

Chinese President Xi Jinping declared last fall that China will strive to peak carbon emissions by 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060. However, Mr. Kerry complained on so many occasions that China's current pledge of carbon neutrality isn't fast enough, with which the rest of the world would have to achieve net zero emissions by 2040 or earlier to solve the climate crisis. Kerry's trip was to prod China to go further, and publicly declare a blanket moratorium on financing international coal-fired projects, among others.

Too often the U.S. is keen to cast China as doing little to tackle climate change. Mr. Kerry and the wider Biden administration have simply ignored China's development phase and what happens on the ground in China where considerable measures to mitigate climate change emissions are being taken.

Effective Sino-U.S. cooperation on climate change should be based on the principle of ""common but differentiated"" to which the Paris Agreement of Climate Change claims to stick.

Climate change is a globally shared existential threat to humanity, requiring global cooperation and joint actions. But diligent responses from each party should vary according to the development phase of each party. This is simply because the developed world emitted a mountain of carbon gas into the biosphere well before the developing world began its development.

As de-industrialization took place in the West with much manufacturing moved to developing countries, foreign consumption contributes much to the carbon figures of developing countries.

The emission reductions targets set by President Xi reflect China's action and resolve to firmly implement the Paris Agreement and keep strengthening efforts to tackle climate change and demonstrate it is a responsible country in pushing for the building of a community with a shared future for mankind.

To honor its commitments to carbon neutrality and advance its ambition, China has shown its willingness to take the bull by the horns in tackling climate change.

The country has called for a ""green transformation,"", linking fresh air, greening the environment, and the sensible use of nature's resources to its national rejuvenation. Green industries have become a new growth driver, where, under the concepts of high-quality development, China has forced traditional sectors to pursue green development and enabled more green industries to emerge."

Last Sunday marked the 1,000th day that Canadian nationals Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig's had been detained in China. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau once again accused China of ""arbitrary detention"" of the two men in a statement on the verdict of Michael Spavor.

However, one must be cautious about using the notion of ""arbitrary detention."" For a politicized reading of a legal concept, by itself, shows no respect for the spirit of law.

Spavor and Kovrig were detained by the Chinese authorities on suspicion of engaging in activities that endangered China's national security in December 2018. Spavor was sentenced to 11 years in jail in August for espionage and illegal provision of state secrets. Kovrig's espionage trial concluded in March but the verdict has yet to be announced.

The Chinese authorities revealed that Spavor had taken photos and videos of Chinese military equipment, which were identified as second-tier state secrets and illegally provided them to some people outside China. Spavor was a ""key informant"" for Kovrig and provided the latter with information for a long period. Between 2017 and 2018, Kovrig entered China under the guise of being a businessman, gathering undisclosed information related to China's national security through his associates in Beijing, Shanghai and Jilin. He wrote analytical reports on the information, which included second-tier state secrets and intelligence."

"'Apres moi, le deluge': Disaster and chaos will follow","Editor's note: M. Alam Brohi is a former member of the foreign service of Pakistan who retired after serving seven years as ambassador to the Kyrgyz Republic and the Islamic Republic of Sudan. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily those of CGTN.

The U.S. forces destroyed or partially disabled as much war ammunition and military equipment as they could in their rushed withdrawal from Afghanistan. Equipment including planes, warship helicopters, Humvees, vehicles, and modern weapons have been rendered useless before the country's new rulers could get to them. This reflects their wounded pride and the rancorous and revengeful attitude toward the Taliban.

The treasure trove of war equipment foreign troops abandoned in their exodus is not what the U.S. leadership bequeathed to Afghanistan, and the French phrase ""apres moi, le deluge,"" which means is ""after me comes the flood,"" says it all. The French term is used to attributed to Louis XV of France and is used in the context of someone leaving somewhere and predicting disaster after their exit. The U.S.'s legacy in Afghanistan includes a badly ravaged country still teeming with militant outfits, drug barons and warlords and afflicted by a broken economy, bankruptcy, political uncertainty, population displacement, brain drain and the fear of crippling economic and financial sanctions and the probable apathy of the Western world.

The problem of Afghanistan that has been causing trepidation in the world for decades cannot be wished away or resolved by shunning, isolating or sanctioning the Taliban or starving the people of Afghanistan. The world has witnessed the sorrowful consequences of such a policy in South Sudan and Darfur, which have been battered by bloodletting and famine. Not long ago, the policy of sanctions also caused the death of thousands of innocent children in Iraq.

According to the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), some 33,000 children have died in Afghanistan in the past two decades. The coercive diplomatic and economic policies have always exasperated chaos.

The U.S., as a superpower, cannot wash its hands of South Asia. It can ill afford to aggravate political instability in Afghanistan, turning it into an ungovernable land and a haven for the militant outfits posing perennial threats to the South and Central Asian countries. Afghanistan is a difficult country to govern and has the potential of destabilizing all surrounding regions. The Taliban have entered the most daunting challenge of their movement in terms of building inclusive governing structures acceptable to all Afghan people. They need to be constructively engaged by the international community and helped in overcoming this challenge."
America's new war in Afghanistan,"Editor's note: Stephen Ndegwa is a Nairobi-based communication expert, lecturer-scholar at the United States International University-Africa, author and international affairs columnist. The article reflects the author's opinions, and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

The U.S. may have finally and officially withdrawn from Afghanistan after a two-decade futile adventure, but it has just opened a can of worms in a new war with the hapless country. Apparently, the superpower has a few more in its bag of tricks to achieve what it failed militarily in its 20-year occupation.

Well, in the modern world, some of the most vicious wars are not being fought with guns and ammunition. America has changed its stratagem in engaging prey that it cannot hunt physically or those that prove too big to swallow. It has particularly perfected the art of fighting using proxy, subterfuge, misinformation and sabotage to undermine those opposed to its hegemonic ways.

An apt case study is its trade war with China, which was started by President Donald Trump. While the jury is still out on the impact of the trade war on both sides, economic experts say the pandemic has exposed which economy is more resilient amid shocks.

Both the U.S. and Afghanistan must be having a feeling of d¨¦j¨¤ vu as the latter is undergoing a radical transition just days to the 20th anniversary of the September 11 tragedy in the U.S. which led to its invasion to flush out al-Qaeda terrorists who were reportedly based in Afghanistan. But it is not possible to turn back the clock now.

Anyway, nothing shows Afghanistan is ready for business more than the opening of its largest money exchange market in Kabul on September 4 by its central bank, the De Afghanistan bank. Although this marks the return of activity in the main money market, billions of dollars of the previous Afghan government financial assets remain frozen in the U.S. Federal Reserve since August.

Over the weekend, Google closed all online accounts of the former Afghanistan's government in order to stop the Taliban from gaining access to classified information. This effectively means that the new regime will not have any institutional memory and a repository of the previous administration's assets domiciled abroad, mainly in the U.S. This includes crucial diplomatic and operational information.

The recent massive emigration of thousands of erstwhile patriotic Afghans to the West under the encouragement of the U.S. has created one of the worst cases of brain drain the world has witnessed. By demonizing the Taliban to create despondency, the country has lost many of its best brains and talents in other areas, which will make the task of nation-building by the Taliban a herculean task. The Western media has been beaming and publishing stories of prominent Afghans overseas who ostensibly ran away from the calamity that is yet to come with a Taliban government."
Ending 'trickle-down' vaccine economics,"During the Irish famine in the 1840s, as more than one million Irish citizens died, vast quantities of food were exported from Ireland to Britain. For the Whig government in London, the defense of commercial interests, the dictates of laissez-faire economics, and political indifference to Irish suffering trumped any obligation to prevent mass starvation by intervening in markets.

This is an equity gap that kills. We know that vaccinations provide effective protection against COVID-19 deaths and hospitalization. As U.S. President Joe Biden has reminded Americans, this is a ""pandemic of the unvaccinated."" The same is true globally. Nevertheless, the United States and other rich countries are now preparing to deliver vaccine booster shots to already-protected populations facing marginal health risks, effectively diverting supplies from countries where access to vaccines is ¨C quite literally ¨C a matter of life and death.

Former UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown recently highlighted the South Africa example as a ""shocking symbol"" of global vaccine injustice. He was right ¨C but the injustice is global. In a world that has delivered more than five billion doses, over 70 percent of people in rich countries have now received at least one jab, compared to only 1.8 percent in the poorest countries.

The message to the world was clear. While EU commissioners and political leaders may arrive at UN meetings waxing lyrical about the importance of international cooperation and global vaccine equity, the iron fist of vaccine nationalism is driving real-world policy. When it comes to weighing African lives against marginal gains in the health of already-protected EU citizens, Africans come in a distant second.

Consider some recent actions by the European Union. Under a contract with Johnson & Johnson (J&J), the bloc has imported millions of vaccine doses from a company in South Africa ¨C a country where a mere 11 percent of the population is vaccinated and the Delta variant is fueling a surge in cases. Yet efforts to divert vaccine exports from Europe to South Africa and its neighbors were met with a display of vaccine gunboat diplomacy, with the EU threatening to take action under a clause in the J&J contract prohibiting export restrictions.

The international response to the COVID-19 pandemic bears a discomfiting resemblance to the British response to the Irish famine. Although science and industry have given us the means to immunize the world, nine months after the first arm was jabbed with a COVID-19 vaccine, rich countries are using their market power to direct doses away from poor countries, placing millions of lives at risk.

The current distribution of vaccines is not just ethically indefensible. It is also epidemiologically short-sighted and economically ruinous. Leaving large swaths of the world unvaccinated increases the risk that vaccine-resistant viral mutations will emerge, effectively prolonging the pandemic and endangering people everywhere. Meanwhile, expanding vaccinations would boost economic recovery ¨C adding $9 trillion to global output by 2025, according to an estimate by the International Monetary Fund ¨C and help prevent major reversals in poverty, health, and education.

Basic arithmetic shows that we can vaccinate the world. Estimates by the data analytics firm Airfinity suggest that around 12 billion vaccine doses will be produced in 2021, with output doubling in 2022. That's more than enough to achieve the international target of 40 percent coverage by the end of this year and 60-70 percent by mid-2022.

Unfortunately, it is not enough to achieve the targets while satisfying rich countries' desire to hoard surplus stocks. With their current contracts, rich countries could achieve full vaccination coverage rates for over 80 percent of their populations, including boosters for vulnerable people, and have a surplus of 3.5 billion doses, according to the Airfinity data ¨C enough to cover the deficit in poor countries and still leave rich countries with a healthy contingency reserve.

Instead, rich countries are actively undermining international cooperation efforts. Aid donors have invested $10 billion in the COVID-19 Vaccine Global Access (COVAX) facility, the international program designed to provide vaccines to the world's poorest countries. That financing has secured contracts for around two billion doses. Additionally, the World Bank has provided $4 billion for COVAX and an African Union vaccine-purchase initiative. But COVAX and poor countries are constantly pushed to the back of the line for supplies from vaccine manufacturers for whom rich countries come first, not least because of their governments' threats to take legal action and impose penalties.

The pandemic has demonstrated that the world needs a more efficient and equitable distribution of vaccine-production capabilities. Developing these capabilities will require knowledge-sharing, technology transfer, intellectual-property waivers, and long-term investment. But without immediate and decisive action to replace the trickle-down approach to vaccine provision with market redistribution, John Maynard Keynes's dictum that ""in the long run we are all dead"" will have a tragic resonance.

There are three priorities. First, vaccine delivery must be aligned with the target of 40 percent coverage in all countries by the end of this year. Rich countries must agree to adjust their own schedules so that vaccine manufacturers can make deliveries for COVAX and developing countries. Building surplus stocks in rich countries while allowing people to die for want of vaccines in poor countries is indefensible. Aid donors should also provide the additional $3.8 billion in grant financing needed to trigger COVAX options on an additional 760 million doses by the end of 2021.

Second, to meet the international targets, we need to move beyond intermittent vaccine donations to large-scale, coordinated dose-sharing. The EU, the UK, and the U.S. should immediately share an additional 250 million doses ¨C less than one-quarter of their collective surplus ¨C through COVAX by the end of September, with a clear schedule for providing an additional one billion doses by early 2022.

Third, beyond vaccine equity, there is an urgent need to strengthen health systems, not just through the provision of medical oxygen, which is in critically short supply, therapeutics, and diagnostic equipment, but also by investing in the health workers and infrastructure needed to get vaccines into arms. The current gap between funds pledged and funds allocated for this purpose is around $16.6 billion.

Our ability to save lives, restore hope, and rebuild economies shattered by the pandemic is constrained not by a shortage of vaccines or financing, but also by a deficit of justice and international cooperation. The governments of rich countries often recite the mantra that ""no one is safe until everyone is safe."" Their leaders must now act like they believe it.

Editor's note: Daryl Guppy is an international financial technical analysis expert. He has provided weekly Shanghai Index analysis for Chinese mainland media for more than a decade. Guppy appears regularly on CNBC Asia and is known as ""The Chart Man."" He is a national board member of the Australia China Business Council. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN. On September 6, Australian Treasurer Josh Frydenberg gave a speech to urge his nation of firm stance against China with the background celebrating 70 years of the Australia, New Zealand and the United States (ANZUS) defense treaty between the three countries. Australia has been somewhat desperate to show how good a friend it has been to the United States, even if the United States has not always reciprocated in full.

Frydenberg used the state of the Australian economy as evidence that Australia had successfully withstood the impacts of Chinese trade restrictions. It's certainly true that some Australian industries have been able to find substitute markets for those lost in China. It's equally true that many businesses have not been able to find substitutes. In his rush to highlight Australia's economic resilience, Frydenberg neglected to mention how the United States ¨C the good friend ANZUS partner ¨C has quickly stepped into the void left by Australian industries in China. U.S. beef exports were an almost perfect replacement for the tonnage lost by Australia due to trade restrictions. The idea of standing shoulder to shoulder with our best friends doesn't seem to have the same cachet in the United States. Frydenberg used this leadership address as an opportunity to berate China and highlight how China's combination of economic strength and global integration ""poses new and significant challenges for many countries."" He said Australia is ""on the frontline"" of growing strategic competition between China and the U.S. He describes China as ""more confident and assertive"" and called this ""a defining feature of the economic and security landscape we face."" Despite a government wish that this view represents a united Australian front, it is a view that does not enjoy unqualified support from business or from those who are attuned to a more nuanced view of the change that is taking place in the region. Just days prior to Frydenberg's speech former Prime Minister Paul Keating said ""the Morrison government is wantonly leading Australia into a strategic dead end by its needless provocations against China.""

What is happening in Chinese fintech sector?,"A sculpture and an Ant Group mascot at the company's headquarters in Hangzhou, China, August 2, 2021. /Getty A sculpture and an Ant Group mascot at the company's headquarters in Hangzhou, China, August 2, 2021. /Getty

Editor's note: Djoomart Otorbaev is the former Prime Minister of the Kyrgyz Republic, a distinguished professor of the Belt and Road School of Beijing Normal University, and a member of Nizami Ganjavi International Center. The article reflects the author's views and not necessarily those of CGTN. In November 2020, the corporate world froze in anticipation. Ant Group, a subsidiary of Alibaba Group, which owns China's central digital payment platform Alipay, was expected to enter the Hong Kong and Shanghai stock exchanges. What was to be the largest IPO in world history, the company was supposed to raise around $34.4 billion. But two days before the IPO, Ant Group announced that it had received a message from Chinese regulators about the need to suspend the process ""due to several significant issues.""

Soon the darkest assumption of analysts came true - in late December, the Chinese authorities launched an antitrust investigation against Alibaba. As a result, the regulator fined the company $2.8 billion, or 4 percent of its 2019 sales in China. It became a record fine in the country's corporate history. At that time, many investors began to wonder what was happening in the Chinese corporate sector. Are the actions of the Chinese regulators an action against one of their companies, or is this act the first step in reforming the entire fintech sector? Now it is becoming clear that the latter assumption turned out to be true. The fog began to dissipate in April when China's central bank tightened business rules for the country's largest high-tech companies. On April 29, the regulator held a meeting with representatives of 13 companies, including IT giants Tencent, ByteDance, JD.com, Trip.com, Meituan and DiDi. It demanded changes in business practices that it considers risky and violates antitrust laws. Regulators wanted to limit the ability of fintech giants to use big data for lending to customers. They were banned from advertising loans to users of payment services, ordered to increase the transparency of transactions and finance at least 30 percent of every loan they issue in partnership with banks. The Wall Street Journal wrote that the requirements of China's central bank were another measure to strengthen control over the representatives of the so-called platform economy, which have developed under relatively soft supervision over the past years. In June, China passed the data security law, which outlines how companies collect, store, process and transmit data. The law, which has been in effect since September 1, said that the authorities would revoke licenses from those IT companies that do it ""wrong."" In July, China's State Council announced that it would revise the rules for IPOs of Chinese companies overseas and strengthen oversight over those already listed. Bloomberg sources said the authorities would block the listing of Chinese companies if their IPOs register outside the country.

Can't Canberra just say no to Washington?,"Editor's note: CGTN's First Voice provides instant commentary on breaking stories. The daily column clarifies emerging issues and better defines the news agenda, offering a Chinese perspective on the latest global events.

Australian Treasurer Josh Frydenberg made a speech at the Australian National University on Monday, vowing to ""defend"" sovereignty in the face of an ""assertive"" China and diversify its economic and trade ties with other countries. Frydenberg, in the wake of fraying Canberra-Beijing ties, doubled down on the tough rhetoric about China and argued that his country can prosper without it.

""Coincidentally,"" his speech comes just days after Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison spoke with U.S. President Joe Biden about a Quad leaders' summit later in the year.

Will Australia ever seek to fix its relationship with China?

At least under the current government, the answer seems to be no.

With Morrison, Australia has displayed an abnormal level of sycophancy toward Washington and, in turn, raged against Beijing, espousing paranoia, McCarthyism, and a lack of sound reasoning and nuance toward its largest economic and trading relationship. It now portrays itself as a victim of ""coercion"" as opposed to recognizing the broader context of the breakdown of ties.

Australia doesn't have a ""China"" problem. Rather, it has an ""America"" problem and scathingly so under the Liberal Party.

Is China coercing Australia? Does Beijing want to force Canberra into submission? The mainstream media and Australian government frequently depict it as such, but there never seems to be any kind of insight into the fact that the country itself instigated a huge deterioration of ties with Beijing to the point that it began to disrupt their vastly integrated economic relationship.

The reason behind this is that Australia simply places too much weight, loyalty and a lack of critical thinking toward its ties with the United States, even when those respective ties appear to hurt Australia in other areas."
Climate and racial justice cannot be separated,"Editor's note: Bradley Blankenship is a Prague-based American journalist, political analyst and freelance reporter. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

In the past year, the United States has seen a huge amount of turmoil over the issue of race, though certainly the issue has persisted for its entire history. The extrajudicial murder of George Floyd, an unarmed Black man, by a white police officer was the impetus for worldwide protests that changed the conversation on race under the slogan, ""Black Lives Matter.""

Still, realities in the United States have made clear that, at least in terms of how the socioeconomic system operates, minorities don't matter the same as whites.

This is evident by the fact that racial minorities in the U.S. have been disproportionately affected both in terms of health outcomes and economic prospects from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. What's more, racial minorities in the United States will also bear the brunt of the negative impacts of climate change, according to an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) report published recently.

This is not an abstract, far-off concept since the report comes just days after Hurricane Ida rocked low-income Black communities in Louisiana and Mississippi. But the results of the analysis suggest that such events will become more frequent, showing that a large percentage of minority communities are situated in areas that will be affected by floods, rising heat, pollution and thus rising mortality.

Given the stakes, this report by the EPA should be a warning signal to policymakers ¨C both in the U.S. and around the world, because it reflects historical, deliberate inequality.

In the case of the U.S., minorities have been purposely segregated ¨C as a matter of federal and local government policy ¨C in areas that are the most environmentally unsafe. In fact, an executive order signed by President Joe Biden a week after coming into office sought to address these burdens faced by minority communities that were segregated into unsafe places, such as coal plants, railway depots and toxic chemical factories."
China is right to protect its youth against internet game disorders,"Editor's note: Adriel Kasonta is a London-based foreign affairs analyst and commentator. He is the founder of AK Consultancy and former chairman of the International Affairs Committee at Bow Group, the oldest conservative think tank in the UK. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

Last week, the Western media and market commentators were knocked off-balance when the National Press and Publication Administration (NPPA), the regulator which approves video game titles in China, announced that gamers under the age of 18 would only be allowed to spend an hour playing online games between 8 p.m. and 9 p.m. on Fridays, weekends and official holidays.

According to the regulator, gaming platforms like Tencent Holdings Ltd. and NetEase Inc. are now required to refrain from providing gaming services to minors in any form outside the mentioned hours. They would need to ensure they had put real name verification systems in place - which makes perfect sense, bearing in mind that children were using adult IDs to circumvent rules put in place in the past.

The new measures are considered to be a continuation of previous restrictions set in 2019, which were limiting gaming time to 1.5 hours on any day and three hours on holidays, with a total ban on playing between 10 p.m. and 8 a.m., as well as confining microtransactions for minors to between $28 to $57, depending on the child's age.

Furthermore, due to the new rules' requirements, all online games should be linked to a state anti-addiction system. Regulators will ratchet up checks over how gaming firms carry out restrictions on things like playing time and in-game purchases and work with parents, schools and other members of the society to combat youth gaming addiction.

Although the real reason for weeping crocodile tears over the tightening of previous regulations relates to selfish profiting concerns in the West, as the Chinese gaming market is the largest in the world, we should look beyond the materialistic analysis, and pay closer attention to the socioeconomic implications of the decisions made by China in the long run.

In 2018, the World Health Organization announced that it was classifying ""gaming disorder"" as a mental health illness for the first time. It is defined by three characteristics, which an addict has to demonstrate for at least 12 months: ""impaired control over gaming,"" prioritizing playing games over other interests and daily activities and continuing to play games ""despite the occurrence of negative consequences.""

Several studies have found links between gaming disorders and anxiety, depression, obesity, insomnia, vision problems resulting from eyestrain, musculoskeletal complications related to physical stress on fingers, hands, wrists, back and neck. Increased time devoted to gaming may also result in having significant impairment in a child's personal, family, social, educational and occupational areas of life, harming its capacity to develop skills critical to building relationships."
U.S.'s power to wage wars is ruining countries and its economy,"Editor's note: Azhar Azam works in a private organization as market and business analyst and writes about geopolitical issues and regional conflicts. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

Just seven days after 9/11 attacks, the U.S. Congress gave an open-ended authority to the U.S. president for use of military force against Afghanistan and nations he ""determines"" planned, harbored and perpetrated the attacks.

Barbara Lee, the only U.S. lawmaker to oppose the Afghanistan war and sweeping authority, had asked her fellow legislators to take some time off and think over the heavy repercussions of the U.S. action. In response, the Californian Democrat was compared with pacifist Jeanette Rankin, who voted against the two world wars.

Her stance was vindicated when U.S. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld announced the end of ""major combat"" operations in Afghanistan and American forces invaded Iraq in 2003. The sudden switch to Baghdad alarmed Americans and pressed returning veterans to question the U.S. president' unlimited powers to wage wars anywhere, exposing the U.S. imperial hubris that inveigles it to interfere in other countries and transgress their right to freedom.

Despite being labeled as a ""terrorist, traitor and clueless liberal,"" Lee continued to fight against the war, lobby the Congress members to repeal the unjust power and bring troops home. Bernie Sanders, having earlier voted for the controversial legislation and later becoming one of the most vocal critics of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, backed Lee's view to practice restraint.

Now Lee is heralded as an ""ignored oracle"" for foreseeing an endless war in Afghanistan. She urged ""caution"" for there was no military solution, yet the 60-word resolution gave a ""blank check"" to any U.S. president to use force all over the world and pushed the country's post-9/11 war spending or obligations to $6.4 trillion by fiscal year 2020.

All of the U.S. wars were almost entirely funded by borrowing. Even as the Costs of War project didn't account for many other expenses, such as macroeconomic costs to America's economy, opportunity costs of not investing war dollars in alternative sectors and future interest on war borrowing ¨C these wars had widened the U.S. budget deficit and raised national debt and consumer interest rates.

The U.S. invaded Afghanistan in late 2001 to topple the Taliban and defeat Al-Qaeda. Unlike the Afghan war, the U.S. invasion of Iraq was complained about by many U.S. military officials over the diversion of resources and strategic thinking from Kabul to Baghdad. By 2009, lack of demonstrable progress in the prolonged nature of the Afghan conflict coupled with mounting casualties and financial costs further weakened ""popular support"" of the mission in the NATO nations.

Only the U.S. war in Afghanistan has left thousands Americans and Afghans dead and siphoned $300 million a day from the U.S. economy. After 20 years, Washington has nothing to show its nation on military achievements in Afghanistan and U.S. President Joe Biden is boasting about evacuations of more than 120,000 people and decamp from Kabul as an ""extraordinary success.""

Washington's belief ""our security and prosperity depend on the security and prosperity of others"" has long been a catchphrase for many to defeat the Taliban. As Biden deployed the U.S. troops on a ""mission of mercy"" to Afghanistan, hundreds of thousands of Afghan wondered where the U.S. commitment to reconstruct the U.S.-devastated country was."
Why is BRI an ideal choice for Afghanistan's future development?,"Editor's note: William Jones is a Washington policy analyst and a non-resident fellow of the Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily those of CGTN.

As the world waits to see the shape of the new Afghan government and whether the Taliban are really prepared to fulfill their commitments to the international community, Afghanistan is rapidly plunging into poverty and starvation. In their wait-and-see stance, the Western countries have cut off access to Afghan government funds and even the International Monetary Fund (IMF) is withholding any major funding to Afghanistan.

United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has appealed to the international community to create a humanitarian aid corridor to get food and other necessities to the Afghan people. He has also called for an international conference to be held on September 13 to mobilize global resources in this crucial endeavor. The immediate necessity is to stave off the growing starvation which is now threatening the country.

But what the ""waiting period"" is creating is precisely the type of chaos that the Taliban are anxious to avoid: a collapse of the economy which will no doubt fuel increased interest among Afghans in a more ""radical"" solution offered by groups like ISIS-K if the Taliban appear incapable of restarting the Afghan economy.

The ""waiting"" policy is sheer folly. Unless some way is found to start the engine of the Afghan economy soon, the country could again be plunged into civil war ¨C this time between the present Taliban leadership and the more radical elements opposed to it as well as the West in general.

At the present, China seems to be the one major country that is seriously attempting to work with the Taliban even during this transition period. While China does not have the resources equivalent to the combined resources available to the Western countries, or control over the locked accounts of the Afghan government, it can help point in the direction that Afghanistan has to move in order to put itself on the road to economic development.

The tremendous natural resources of the country, including one of the world's largest unexploited reserves of copper, coal, iron, gas, cobalt, mercury, gold, thorium and lithium, represent the future wealth of the nation. But these have to be exploited in order to be of any benefit."
Only pragmatic U.S. outreach will deliver climate objectives,"As the U.S. Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry concluded his four-day visit to China on September 2, the need for improving his country's bilateral relations with China has all the more increased.

Editor's note: Hayat Bangash is a freelance columnist on international affairs with degrees in business administration and war studies. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

Climate change is a common global problem that requires the highest level of cooperation. While industrialization is continuing to warm the planet, all inhabitants remain tied to the same fate. This inevitably calls for shunning differences and giving up the policies that have gone outdated and ineffective.

One such policy of the U.S. has been an ineffectual pursuit of its global primacy. American exceptionalism is a tested and failed concept that has resulted in reducing the country's prestige and global standing to the level where it is today. Bargaining from a perceived position of strength does not deliver results in today's globalized world where multi-polarity is rapidly transforming into non-polarity.

In an increasingly open international economy, where the role of developing nations is often surpassing that of developed ones, the self-assured hubris among American policymakers is neither helping the world nor is it benefiting the United States.

Climate change is one challenge where the U.S. must pay heed to the ground realities of the day by honoring its allies and respecting who it considers its competitors. This will appreciably lift the stature of the U.S. that received a severe dent during its last presidency and after the latest handling of its foreign engagements.

If successive American governments continue coming up with new concoctions against China, or for that matter against any country, the spirit of cooperation that is a prerequisite of solving climate change issues will be lost. Likewise, if the standing of American diplomacy is affected beyond a certain point, its capricious overtures will be taken by the global community with a pinch of salt.

The starting point for the U.S. to pursue climate change discussions with China should be to seek common ground. It should ascertain which national priorities of the two governments coincide and where do their global interests overlap.

At the same time, the Biden administration should avoid focusing only on the political optics aimed at its domestic audiences. It is evident that the approval ratings of the administration that fell after the events in Afghanistan need some fixing, but any such attempt through any undue diplomatic fantasia must be steered clear of.

The avoidable wars that the U.S. initiated after the turn of the century have drastically reduced the capacities of the invaded countries to keep their carbon emissions under check. In the greater discussion of mitigating the effects of climate change, the need for global peace and enabling the third world to achieve carbon neutrality also deserves a higher priority.

Riding upon its conceit, the U.S. has committed a number of strategic miscalculations in the last two decades. On one hand, its allies across the Atlantic are calling for shedding their dependence on the U.S., while on the other, China policy of the U.S. has a significant number of critics within the U.S. if not greater than those without.

Shedding the propensity of the U.S. policymakers to see everything from a political lens disallows them to give objective attention to common problems like climate change."
Sanction addictions and stalled Vienna talks affect world peace,"Editor's note: Hamzah Rifaat Hussain, a former visiting fellow at the Stimson Center in Washington and a former assistant researcher at the Islamabad Policy Research Institute (IPRI), is a TV anchor at Indus News in Pakistan. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

When U.S. President Joe Biden emphasized how his administration was purportedly seeking to roll back America's historical role of policing across the world, it would make sense for many impartial observers to take these assertions with a pinch of salt.

While the United States overtly considers itself now as a revamped nation with a proclivity toward international cooperation instead of coercion, the faltering talks in Vienna aimed at reviving the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) deal with Iran is a soft reminder that not much has changed.

In fact, time is running out for the international community in dealing with the Tehran leadership with strategic wisdom with a probable failure of multilateralism impending if there is no change in course.

Iran's Foreign Minister, Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, on August 31, suggested that the deliberations in Austria will not continue for a few months. The growing understanding in Tehran is that the White House will not relent on pernicious sanctions with ongoing talks and dialogue now limited to positive optics only.

Few can blame Iran for its skepticism. However, given that contrary to President Biden's assertions that the U.S. is now renouncing policing roles, the Treasury Department announced further sanctions against Iranian intelligence operatives, which it considered involved in smear campaigns against dissidents abroad.

Putting the vagaries of espionage aside, sanctioning foreign operatives in times of brewing tensions and acrimony is akin to Cold War-era policing in the presence of trust deficits becoming entrenched.

This will cloud any further deliberations even if P5+1 members, namely China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States, plus Germany, chart a different course of action.

Sadly, continued American defiance ensures that lingering on with talks will be a futile exercise in the absence of sanction waivers, and in the words of the Iran President Ebrahim Raisi himself, dialogue for the sake of dialogue will not result in anything concrete on the JCPOA.

Since the election of President Raisi and cautious optimism over the possible amenability of the new Iranian government, an opportunity has existed for the Biden administration based on partaking in consultations and assuring Tehran that their legitimate security threats are factored in while seeking a new beginning which includes subjects such as deterrence and de-escalation."
Who are the elites behind the military-industrial complex?,"If one assumes that Western states act as logical actors, on behalf of their citizens' interests, then the endless U.S.-led wars, like Afghanistan, make no sense. Instead, one must look within the state at the actors pulling the levers of power. For example, when looking at Afghanistan the interests of the military-industrial complex clearly hijacked American democracy.

Editor's note: Keith Lamb is a University of Oxford graduate with an MSc degree in Contemporary Chinese Studies. His primary research interests are China's international relations and ""socialism with Chinese characteristics."" The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

However, it's not just a case that the military-industrial complex needs reforming as this is merely one manifestation of Western capitalism whose desire for extracting surplus goes beyond profiting only from weapons sales. For example, Iraq also provided for the wholesale looting of its resources and the liberalization of its economy opened it up to transnational capital.

In the past colonialism was usually carried out by a singular Western power but the invasions of this century, while U.S.-led, were collective Western ones. While multiple Western states occupying the Global South is sold to us as the ""international community"" enforcing justice it actually reflects the merging of Western state capital into transnational capital. Thus, Afghanistan was not a twenty-year war for the sake of human rights and beating terrorism but a colonial occupation. Just like former colonies it was used for the purpose of extracting a surplus by Western capital.

The simple fact is that since the end of World War II, with hyper-financialization and the rise of the transnational corporation, former Western national bourgeoisies have merged into a transnational elite. The West essentially now has ""one system, many countries"" and independence, just like that of the formerly occupied Afghanistan, is merely nominal.

Obfuscating this system is the fact that the name of this transnational Western elite hasn't been settled on, indeed they remain largely hidden. In common parlance, the ""one percent"" is widely used while others use the term ""transatlantic ruling elite"" which describes its hegemonic location. I often use terms like ""transnational liberal elite"" or ""liberal capital"" because it forces those who worship at the ""altar of liberalism"" to be mindful of the destructive hard power behind their human-rights ideology which is used as a cover for imperialism.

In the economic realm neoliberalism is the dominant ideology of this liberal elite. It demands open borders for capital and the undemocratic privatization of public goods which is propagandized as being in the interests of all rather than their specific class interests. Consequently, their class war isn't being waged only in the Global South it is also being waged against the average Western citizen who must accept these privatizations and is gaslighted to accept them as a universal good.

Gaslighting also explains why Western citizens believe they go to places like Afghanistan to save and protect when in fact it is colonialism for the sake of surplus extraction. Western populaces paying for these wars, with their blood and taxes, demonstrates how powerful this transnational liberal elite's brainwashing is. Indeed, only as Afghanistan comes to an end do some begin to recognize their false consciousness.

For false consciousness to reign, the power of liberal capital, which funds universities, civil society, NGOs, political parties, and the media must be all-encompassing. Take the pro-war media mogul Rupert Murdoch as a case in point. His private transnational media interferes in Western democracy by holding sway over public opinion."

The shock on September 3, i.e. the de facto resignation of Yoshihide Suga has once again plunged Japan into political uncertainty. The Japanese prime minister informed his Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) that he would not be seeking re-election as its president.

Editor's note: Freddie Reidy is a freelance writer based in London. He studied history and history of art at the University of Kent, Canterbury, specializing in Russian history and international politics. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

Prime Minister Suga only took up the position last year after another surprise resignation, that of his predecessor Shinzo Abe, who left office over health concerns.

LDP Secretary General Toshihiro Nikai told reporters, ""Today at the executive meeting, Suga said he wants to focus his efforts on anti-coronavirus measures and will not run in the leadership election.""

Suga later added, ""I did consider running, but it requires enormous energy to do coronavirus measures as well as an election campaign. I cannot do both. I must focus on COVID-19 measures.""

The resignation presents the LDP with a real challenge. Many frontrunners to succeed the incumbent prime minister appear to have the same weaknesses as Suga. The LDP is caught between a desire for continuity and stability while becoming increasingly aware that they need a leader who can articulate their political vision with compassion and conviction.

This was a gift that Abe had, coupled with a flagship economic policy, ""Abenomics,"" which still forms the backbone of Japanese economic thinking.

The somewhat opaque and intransigent nature of much of the nation's political elite is increasingly falling from favor, as political analyst Gerald Curtis told The Economist, ""These qualities are less acceptable to the Japanese public today.""

Even the LDP secretary general remarked that policy must be communicated properly in today's society. ""The steps along the way are explained to the people is also key¡­ and this is something which Suga is very bad at doing.""

While Suga did make progress in modernizing Japanese bureaucracy, setting out the country's path to carbon neutrality in 2050 and keeping the Japan's COVID-19 death toll the lowest in the G7, significant challenges remained.

Japan remains in a state of emergency owing to multiple coronavirus outbreaks. The economy has stalled and hosting the Olympics was widely viewed as a major miscalculation."

Editor's note: Mariam Shah is an Islamabad-based independent researcher in the field of conflict studies and military psychology. The article reflects the author's views, and not necessarily those of CGTN. Before dawn of August 31, the last U.S. plane flew out of Afghanistan, marking an end to American supremacy on Afghan soil. The entire withdrawal turned out to be a nightmare for the U.S. policymakers, Afghan public and soldiers on ground.

Unfortunately, due to the short-sightedness and impudence, the entire chronicle turned debacle is laden with misadventures, blood, destruction, war crimes and policy blunders, making it an ignominious war and withdrawal. Afghanistan will suffer for a longer duration as a result of an unethical and irresponsible withdrawal. Something that still bothers me is that even after all this loss the U.S. won't learn the lesson. The reason being, U.S. policymakers never learned it before, even through the hard way. In modern times, the U.S. has waged wars outside its territory. First, it was Vietnam, then Lebanon and Afghanistan, followed by Iraq. War devastates a country from within, shatters the core fabric of society, and severely impacts the economy and infrastructure, giving both physical and psychological wounds to the masses. Somehow, the present generation in the U.S. is unaware of the horrors of war. As the U.S. ended its mission, a lot of Afghans feel betrayed, especially the ones who helped the U.S. administration and somehow are left behind during the evacuation phase. A lot of U.S. and NATO war veterans are in shock and critical of what exactly happened, as the rebuilding process and counterterrorism efforts for the last 20 years burst like a bubble in seconds. For many, the question ""was it worth it"" will remain there for years to come. Lessons learned There are few lessons for the global powers here. Solutions for critical global issues, including armed struggles and violence should be political rather than military oriented. Military power and prowess is one tool, weapons can't win wars and bring reforms in the longer run. War without a clear strategy and motives is destined to fail miserably even after two decades and spending billions. Besides, knowing the indigenous culture, societal norms and mass psychology is very important. It is high time that this region, players, subjects and the war should be studied from a different lens and not just typical blame game rhetoric.

The G20 must recommit to COVAX,"Editor's note: Seth Berkley is CEO of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. The article reflects the author's opinions, and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

It is one year since the international community gave its backing to the COVID-19 Vaccine Global Access (COVAX) facility to lead a worldwide effort to end the acute phase of the pandemic. The initiative aimed to ensure that every country, and not just those with sufficient money or resources, could access life-saving vaccines once they became available. As G20 health ministers prepare to meet in Rome on September 5-6, they are in a position to ensure that COVAX fulfills its mission.

A year ago, no one knew when or even if it might be possible to develop a safe and effective vaccine against COVID-19, let alone the 20 that are available today. But since making its first international deliveries in February, COVAX ¨C a partnership established by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, the World Health Organization, UNICEF, and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance ¨C has delivered more than 235 million vaccine doses to 139 countries, and expects to deliver another billion doses in the fourth quarter.

Only China, India, and the United States have delivered more. This start to the largest and most complex vaccine rollout in history has given hope to millions of people and laid solid foundations for how we respond to future pandemics.

Yet, so much more could, and should, have been achieved by now. It is unacceptable that only 1.8 percent of people in low-income countries have received their first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, compared to 82 percent in high- and upper-middle-income countries. This shocking inequality is as economically senseless as it is destructive to human life, with the latest estimate of the cost of the slow rollout amounting to $2.3 trillion.

The world was woefully unprepared for a pandemic, and this is reflected in the challenges COVAX has faced. By the time initial funding arrived, wealthy countries had already locked up early vaccine supplies. Export bans affecting key suppliers, and difficulties experienced by many manufacturers in scaling up production to the required level, also undermined COVAX's ability to access doses early.

Given increasing global vaccine inequity and the rise of new, more contagious coronavirus variants, we must put these challenges behind us. Thanks to the support of almost all G20 governments, alongside that of foundations and private businesses, COVAX has now raised nearly $10 billion and secured more than 600 million donated doses. All the preparations are in place for the most comprehensive vaccination effort that the world has seen.

Based on the committed orders COVAX has placed with vaccine manufacturers and the additional donations, hundreds of millions of new doses should now be available each month. We need to make sure they reach poorer countries and get into people's arms. To avoid further delays, and for the facility to succeed, we need support from G20 leaders in four key areas."
Beijing Stock Exchange promotes long-term development of real economy,"Editor's note: Matteo Giovannini is a finance professional at the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China in Beijing and a member of the China Task Force at the Italian Ministry of Economic Development. The article reflects the author's views, and not necessarily those of CGTN.

Financial markets are widely known for playing a crucial role in the development process of a country's economy by enabling an orderly allocation of resources and by providing a constant stream of liquidity to companies and entrepreneurs.

China has for a long time understood the importance of introducing major market economy reforms and opening-up policies with the goal of not only serving the needs of the domestic economy but also matching the level of expectations foreign investors have towards the world's second-largest economy.

On September 2, during a speech at the Global Trade in Services Summit of the 2021 China International Fair for Trade in Services in Beijing, Chinese President Xi Jinping unveiled the government's plan for the establishment of a new national stock exchange in the capital Beijing that is set to become a platform where innovative-driven SMEs can raise funds from investors.

The first aspect to consider is that the launch of an SME-targeted exchange is a clear response to an evident need for market access of companies that either lack the size, track record or assets for having a loan granted by a lender.

Data from the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology show that in the last two years only 300 of the 5,000 highly innovative SMEs identified have successfully completed an IPO on a Chinese mainland stock exchange. These numbers represent the evidence of the level of difficulty that SMEs have had to constantly face in attempting to go public due to high entry barriers in a lending market still dominated by state-owned banks.

In this sense, the decision to launch a new exchange is a very welcome initiative because it can be seen as an attempt to further develop the onshore capital market by deepening and widening its scope and by making it an attractive place where innovative companies can find an alternative way to raise funds."
"When it comes to tech, China puts its children above profits","Editor's note: Keith Lamb is a University of Oxford graduate with an MSc degree in Contemporary Chinese Studies. His primary research interests are international relations of China and China's ""socialism with Chinese characteristics."" The article reflects the author's opinions, and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

On Monday, China introduced new regulations restricting those under 18 to one hour of online gaming between 8 pm and 9 pm on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. This means children will only be able to game three hours a week. Though online gaming companies, such as Tencent, already use facial recognition to detect those flouting existing rules, further measures will be taken to verify the identity of those gaming, and regulators will work with parents and schools when it comes to gaming addiction.

I must say how incredibly supportive I am of these new rules, which put the safety and well-being of China's future above profits. The problem of online gaming ""stealing the souls"" of our children is a phenomenon experienced worldwide. The dopamine release through addictive gaming can frazzle children's minds, and many of us know of a child who has been indulged with too much gaming, who is happy only when gaming, whose outgoing nature changes utterly when a game machine is introduced, and who even becomes verbally violent when gaming limits are enforced.

The happiest children, in actuality, are those who have strict limits on their gaming time. Unfortunately, for some parents, such enforcement doesn't come easy, especially as kids turn into teenagers with tempers, whose sense of right is conditioned by their similarly immature peers. Consequently, it is important that there is a law governing children's gaming time, backing the moral authority of parents, and children, in turn, will less likely blackmail their parents emotionally. Truly, this sort of legal innovation would be highly desirous in Western countries too.

My gut instinct is that this law, because it is being introduced in China, will at first be reported within the framework of restricting freedom. However, is this not empowering both adults and children? I don't deny that computer games can be fun, but where is the freedom when one turns into a drooling vegetable gaming all day? Furthermore, some parents can barely get their children out of the house these days.

Protecting children, when it comes to technology, is just part of the broader measures China is taking to protect society as a whole. China is in the midst of democratizing its internet space by getting tougher on anti-competitive practices. For example, the Chinese Ministry of Industry and Information Technology is addressing ""tough problems,"" such as the infringement of user rights ¡ª specifically, not allowing users to opt-out of personalization, not encrypting users' sensitive data, using pop-ups that mislead users, and blocking access to other websites without consent.

The Western media, unsurprisingly, describes this measure as a ""crackdown,"" but it is in fact about bringing the rule of law to cyberspace and regulating capital. True, Chinese tech companies such as Alibaba, Tencent, ByteDance, and Meituan are innovative, but this doesn't mean they are not above the law or the rules of the market. Innovation and profits should not trump the well-being of China's citizens."
How politicization of COVID-19 has hurt the world,"Editor's note: Su Di is a researcher at Maku Insights, a think tank specializing in showing the real China to the world. Wen Yang is a researcher at the China Institute of Fudan University. They are the authors of the new book ""Why China Once Again"" which presents a comprehensive explanation of how China managed to control the COVID-19 pandemic. The article reflects the authors' opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

The 90-day U.S. intelligence review was released on August 27, but Joe Biden should feel disappointed and ashamed about the Wuhan lab-leak theory. According to the summary, the investigation was inconclusive on coronavirus origins; the virus was not developed as a biological weapon and is unlikely to have been engineered.

The result was predictable since virus origins tracing is a scientific mission rather than a political inquiry. Shortly before, some scientists had asserted that the Delta variant proves that the virus lab-leak theory is ""extremely unlikely"" and they criticized the grappling over the lab-leak theory as ""a complete waste of time."" ""It is highly unlikely that researchers could just tinker with the virus to add a few mutations and expect it to become super-efficient at infecting the human population,"" they said.

As U.S. politicians and lab leaky theory supporters argue over its origins, the deadly virus is still wreaking havoc across the world. To date, it has caused the deaths of around 4.5 million people, about 640,000 of whom are in the United States, the most powerful country in the world. Who should be blamed for this enormous loss of life?

Coronavirus and its Delta variant are the undisputed offenders; however, the politicization of the epidemic has made things worse and should therefore be blamed the most. After the outbreak, the politicization of the epidemic has occurred over and over, with politics overriding science. The epidemic has even been used as a tool of a ""new Cold War"" against China as the West targets its geopolitical competitor.

Politics overriding science, most recently through the resurrection of the lab-leak theory, has been consistent throughout the epidemic. The WHO's coronavirus origins report in March stated that it's highly unlikely that the coronavirus escaped from a lab at the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV), and most scientists believe that evidence overwhelmingly favors SARS-CoV-2 having spilled over from animals into humans. Despite this, lab leak supporters are unlikely to be satisfied.

China has been arguing that the identification of the virus origins is a complex scientific issue. It can only be undertaken by scientists around the world through joint research.

But it seems different in the U.S., the rumor ""Wuhan lab-leak theory"" was posted by a U.S. Republican Senator on Fox News in February 2020, propagated by former President Donald Trump, his Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and other U.S. politicians last year. And then novelist Nicholson Baker even went further and argued that ""gain of function"" research supported by the U.S. was being pursued at the Wuhan Lab.

All in all, it is clear that U.S. politicians, novelists, science reporters, etc. promoted the increasingly popular conspiracy theory, which led to Biden's 90-day intelligence review. Compared to the clamor of U.S. politicians and journalists, scientists' voices have been drowned out or ignored, unfortunately. Due to the politicization of the epidemic, coronavirus origins tracing is not a science problem anymore, but a Hollywood movie.

The most notorious contributor to the politicization of the epidemic was Donald Trump. In addition to labeling the coronavirus as the China Virus and launching a new cold war against China that has caused the deterioration of the China-U.S. relationship to its lowest point, he also meddled in scientists' affairs and created numerous lies about COVID-19."
Supporting higher education for sustainable development in China,"Editor's note: Alexander Ayertey Odonkor is an economic consultant, chartered financial analyst, and chartered economist with an in-depth understanding of the economic landscape of countries in Asia and Africa. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

Higher education institutions play an integral role in achieving social, environmental and economic sustainability. They equip policymakers, entrepreneurs, economists, environmental scientists, urban planners and other relevant decision-makers with adequate knowledge and the required skills set to carry out informed decisions that promote sustainable development.

Therefore, significant improvements in the quality and accessibility of higher education could augment efforts to address climate change, global poverty, inequality and other interconnected challenges such as food and water scarcity. There is much empirical evidence around the world that indicates the importance of higher education in accomplishing sustainable development goals. However, China's support of higher education for sustainable development in recent decades has been remarkable.

The benefit gained from supporting higher education with the ultimate objective of attaining sustainable development is evident in China's perceptible transition from humble beginnings to the world's second largest economy.

After the country's economic reforms in 1978, the Chinese government has been making considerable progress in improving the quality and equitable access of higher education by strengthening access to higher education via the building of research universities that produce cutting-edge scientific research. The country is also producing graduates empowered with knowledge, skills, values and attitudes to carry out socio-economic activities that promote sustainable development.

The country is experiencing eye-catching progress towards sustainable development largely as a result of the Chinese government's vision to make high-quality higher education accessible. The building of highly skilled human capital together with institutional reforms, establishment and extension of higher education institutions and a significant increase in public expenditure on education in the last few decades has made this goal attainable. For example, between 1998 and 2003, the Chinese government's spending on education was increased by one percentage point of the entire government expenditure per year.

While a general effort to improve the quality and delivery of education was a step in the right direction, the government also made several specific provisions to improve the quality of higher education, including the initiation of special funding programs that provided financial support to selected institutions that foster reforms and innovation.

Notable among these unique provisions were Project 211 and Project 985 initiated in 1995 and 1998, respectively. While Project 211 has strengthened the scientific research, management and institutional efficiency of 116 higher education institutions, Project 985 which initially commenced with nine universities and later rose to 39, has been successful in establishing top-notch Chinese universities which have consistently been listed among the top tier.

China's phenomenal commitment to improving the quality and access to higher education is yielding considerable results. Currently, China is home to the world's largest higher education system with over 40 million students. During the duration of the country's 13th Five-Year Plan (2016-2020), 3.39 million students graduated with a master's degree and 333,000 students obtained doctoral degrees.

By committing adequate resources to bolster research and development in higher education institutions which includes but not limited to building of many key national laboratories, China is striving in improving access to high-quality higher education. From 2016 to 2019, the country invested $119 billion in research and development at the tertiary level.

While it is commendable that China is exhibiting unflinching support to improve the quality of research and development, the important question is whether these investments are yielding any significant results on the global stage? Well, the answer to this question could be found in the 2022 edition of the Times Higher Education World University Rankings that was published on September 2, 2021.

This latest edition which focuses on global research published between 2016 and 2020 and citations that were made in 2021 shows that the Capital Medical University, Wenzhou Medical University and Wuhan University in China are the institutions with the highest leap in citation impact scores in absolute terms with a score of more than 30 points."

Editor's note: M. Alam Brohi is a former member of the foreign service of Pakistan who retired after serving seven years as ambassador to the Kyrgyz Republic and the Islamic Republic of Sudan. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily those of CGTN.

Celebratory gunfire resounded across the Afghan capital on August 31 as the Taliban took control of the airport following the withdrawal of the last U.S. troops, marking the end of a 20-year war. After the departure of the last flight, a Taliban spokesman called it a ""historic day and a historic moment."" ""We are proud of these moments, that we liberated our country from a great power,"" he added. This, indeed, was a sobering day for the U.S. leadership.

After long 18 years of bloodletting and prevarication, America's leaders finally came to seriously realize the improbability of finding any other resolution of the Afghanistan war than sitting across the table with the Taliban. The talks culminated in the peace agreement of February 2020 that paved the way for the evacuation of foreign forces from the country and the return of Taliban to power.

The war brought disaster not only to Afghanistan but also inflicted a heavy price on Pakistan in human lives and economic loss. The Brown University's report ""Costs of War Project"" of 2018 made painful revelations for the world and the American public that had largely remained indifferent to the loss of American lives in wars waged in far-off regions of Southwest Asia and the Middle East. The report says that the number of war-related killings in Pakistan was as high as 65,000 in all these years. These included civilians and security personnel.

The report adds, ""As of October 2018, the fatalities in Afghanistan stood over 147,000 people, encompassing Afghan security forces, civilians and opposition fighters. Some 6,334 American soldiers and contractors, as well as more than 1,100 allied troops also lost their lives between 2001 and 2018."" The true number of the Americans injured, disabled, or inflicted with psychological diseases was kept a guarded secret lest it may provoke public unrest reviving the bitter reminiscences of the Americans' outrage over the Vietnam casualties.

The U.S. remained involved in wars in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria, and many other countries, and extended coalition support funds to its allies in anti-terrorist wars including Pakistan in the past 17 years. However, this financial assistance to Pakistan was stopped in 2017 because of differences between the two countries on the Afghanistan conundrum. The Brown University report suggests the U.S. spent over $5.6 trillion on its war on terrorists in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria.

The U.S. funding of reconstruction programs in Iraq and Afghanistan ranges between $170-180 billion. Most of these funds had gone towards arming security forces in both countries, while the money allocated to humanitarian relief and rebuilding civil society was lost to corruption, fraud, waste and abuse by the leaders installed in power by the U.S. There was no accountability system in place to ensure transparency in spending the funds. They escaped scot-free with their loot.

Pakistan had been steadfastly counseling the American leadership to recognize the ground reality and start direct talks with the Taliban to bring an end to the festering Afghan war. The former Donald Trump administration tried hard its policy of ""maximum pressure and engagement"" on Pakistan. There was no dearth of rabid voices in the American Congress and Senate calling Pakistan one of the top ""frenemies"" in the American foreign policy due to its alleged tolerance of Taliban sanctuaries on its soil even if it cooperated with the U.S. in Afghanistan in other ways."

Why is the public so skeptical about this report? And what's wrong with its methodology?"

"When it comes to spying, U.S. 'dominates' the world","Ahead of Joe Biden's upcoming trip to Europe, the U.S. National Security Agency spying scandal has once again rocked European politics. A special report by Danish public broadcaster Danmarks Radio revealed on May 30 that, relying on its partnership with Denmark's intelligence service, the U.S. National Security Agency used Danish information cables to spy on leaders and senior officials of European allies, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel. How does this scandal relate to Edward Snowden's revelations in 2013? What exactly is America's global surveillance operation? And how is the world reacting to this?"
Why do Western countries always play the 'Tibet card'?,"Since the Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368), Tibet has been part of China and under the administrative jurisdiction of the Chinese government.

Transcript: Liu Xin interviews Sten Vermund on virus origins tracing,"25:30

The U.S. intelligence community has failed to shed any new light on the origins of SARS-CoV-2, and no evidence had been found to suggest that a lab in Wuhan was unsafe or tinkering with the virus. This did not come as a surprise for many given the deep scientific nature of thus task. But where should people look next? What is holding up the progress of the COVID-19 origins study? What are the ramifications of the anti-China rhetoric peddled by politicians in some countries on cross-border scientific cooperation? Earlier, Liu Xin spoke with Prof. Sten Vermund, Dean of the Yale School of Public Health. He is an infectious disease epidemiologist focusing on diseases in low and middle-income countries. Below is a transcript of the interview. Liu Xin: Let's talk about the origins tracing study of COVID-19. Where most likely do you think COVID-19 originated? How do you regard the equivalence given by some in the scientific community to both the natural origins hypothesis and the lab leak hypothesis? Dr. Sten Vermund: These are excellent questions. We believe that coronaviruses are largely in bat populations. There were four coronaviruses circulating in humans before SARS. Then we had SARS, then we had MERS. Now we have the novel coronavirus. So that makes seven in total. The previous six seemed to be of natural origin. We have not had the good fortune in the case of novel coronavirus to identify a clear intermediate animal host. There's been an intensive search, but it's not obvious whether something similar to SARS occurred, such as a wet market exposure in sort of the exotic food industry, or whether there was some other exposure. The lab accidents hypothesis doesn't have any evidence to back it up, so it remains just that ¨C just a hypothesis. Liu Xin: But by and large, you believe the novel coronavirus came from nature? Dr. Sten Vermund: It's far more likely that it came from nature than through some laboratory accident. The virology lab in Wuhan, as with modern virology labs around the world, take extraordinary precautions for the security of their products and the personal protective equipment for virologists working with potentially serious agents is very fastidious. And I think it would be very improbable that a lab accident were responsible for this release.

Liu Xin: There have been multiple studies about possible earlier emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in other parts of the world, prior to Wuhan. For instance, in Europe, in Italy, there has been this paper where researchers believe or assess that there is a high possibility that COVID-19 was already circulating in northern Italy in late June to late August of 2019. And similar studies also emerged in the other parts of the world, for instance, in the United States. You must have also read where they analyzed blood samples from the American Red Cross, where they found that, you know, the actual emergence time of this disease is earlier than the believed January of 2020. Instead, it's believed to be somewhere in early December 2019, if not earlier. So, what do these findings tell you, reveal to you, about what may have happened before Wuhan? Dr. Sten Vermund: These are intriguing and confusing reports. We had the same phenomenon with HIV. HIV was not recognized until about 1981. But there are a number of studies looking at blood samples from 1975, even 1965, there's one study from the 1950s, stating that there was HIV and humans at that time. Unfortunately, it's hard to replicate these studies when they come from unique blood specimens. One can't be absolutely sure. We rely very heavily on replication in science. The studies from Italy, the United States and elsewhere, suggesting that novel coronavirus, the SARS-CoV-2, actually was in humans well before the Wuhan outbreak, that falls in the same category. Very intriguing and very suggestive, but not very definitive, because we would like to see replication. In these other reports, they were not associated with a clinical outbreak. So we didn't fill up the hospitals with patients. If this virus was circulating, perhaps it was a different strain, a different variant. Perhaps it was not as pathogenic to humans. These are the sorts of things people are trying to investigate right now. Liu Xin: Where do you think people should look next for clues if finding the origins of SARS-CoV-2 is very important? Dr. Sten Vermund: The tie between bats, intermediate hosts and humans is the most productive line of investigation, in my view.

Liu Xin: So, you must have been reading the press. And obviously, there has been, I don't know whether you notice, but there has been a large volume of reports, even editorials pointing to the Wuhan lab leak hypothesis and pressing China to open it up or to accept audits, even if scientists have already visited. What do you make of such a push for so-called greater transparency on China? Dr. Sten Vermund: I don't think it should be unique to China. I think all of the world's virology labs and biology labs that handle potentially dangerous substances should cooperate with the World Health Organization, and they should cooperate with each other to try to maintain safety standards at the highest level. This is why licensure of such labs is done in China, as well as it is also done in Europe and North America, why there are rigorous safety protocols in place where you can have spot audits, where visitors come in representing regulatory agencies to check that everything is being done properly. We've had quite a number of laboratory errors around the world, including in the United States, so we must maintain a strong level of security and vigor. In the United States, you may recall, in 2001, the month after 9/11, we had the anthrax outbreak, and this was a bioterrorism event that seems to have been promulgated by a former employee of a major bio-secure laboratory. And it looks like he stole the anthrax spores from the laboratory and used them for domestic bio terrorism. So how can someone take a product and deliberately removed it from the lab, and nobody else knows? That's an example of where we have to be very vigilant in laboratories. And that goes for Fort Detrick, Maryland, and that goes for the CDC and that goes for the China CDC and that goes for the Wuhan virology labs. All of them need to be guaranteed secure and safe. I have no evidence that the Wuhan lab was not doing a good job. In fact, the WHO investigation suggests that it was doing a good job. And now the Biden administration, those data are not available fully yet, but they seem to be, from the executive summary, there is no information to suggest the Wuhan lab was unsafe in any way.

Liu Xin: Yeah, exactly. As you mentioned, on August the 27th, the U.S. intelligence community after a 90-day investigation, failed to come to any kind of conclusive assessment as to the origins of COVID-19. Of course, we do not know the full content of that report. What is your comment on what we know from the report and its findings? Dr. Sten Vermund: I only know what I've read, which is limited, similar to what you've read. It looks like it will be an inconclusive report. They will not be able to assess the Wuhan lab security, and they will not be able to make any kind of conclusion. It seems not to have been a fruitful investigation. My own view is that the intelligence agencies of the United States may do a fine job in assessing political or military vulnerability or risk, but I'm not sure they're the most qualified to evaluate a virology lab. Liu Xin: What do you think has led to the current impasse or pause, let's say, in the progress toward understanding the origins of the virus? What do you think are the forces, if there are any, that have been behind such a stalemate? Dr. Sten Vermund: That's an excellent question. Scientists like to collaborate with each other. And politics rarely interferes. We would like to get to the bottom of a mystery and find out where, for example, coronavirus came from. I would love to have a bilateral arrangement, the Chinese government, U.S. government, both fund teams, that would actually work together. Study bat virus, coronaviruses, study potential intermediate hosts, try to get to the bottom of the origin of the virus. If they want to look at laboratory safety, they can do that too. Right now, our collegial relations are not what they used to be. I can imagine a study like that being done 10 years ago, and both governments being very supportive. But today, we are paying the price of the anti-Sino rhetoric of our previous president. And I think our Congress has, unfortunately, taken a sort of negative view of China. But we scientists don't share this view. We think that Chinese science is powerful, and Chinese scientists are among the leading thinkers worldwide. We welcome the opportunity to collaborate with Chinese scientists to get to the bottom of important medical mysteries.

Liu Xin: Who should be leading this job? I mean, right now, there has been a mechanism under the mandate of the World Health Assembly resolution. A group of international scientists have been selected to come and collaborate with Chinese scientists, and they did some job, and they came up with a report. But so far, it has been stalled. The report has come under a lot of criticism that these group of scientists have to come out and publish an explanatory opinion piece in a scientific magazine most recently. So, who should be assigned to do this very important job under the existing environment that we have? Dr. Sten Vermund: First of all, I don't think you can get to the bottom of a major scientific question with a two-month review. Where do these viruses come from? Are they actually of bat origin, which is what we think? Which animals might they be infecting? Which animals might be most likely to result in human infection? These are the big questions, and these cannot be answered in 30, 60, 90 days. So we're going to need strong multidisciplinary teams of scientists, preferably an international team, which will increase the credibility of science, I think. Liu Xin: Yeah, indeed, you're talking about a very ideal situation, but it seems to be very difficult at this moment, right? To have this kind of pure ideal scientific collaboration. But anyway, that's the kind of wish or idea that should be expressed to, you know... Dr. Sten Vermund: I don't think we should give up. I don't think we should give up because top Chinese scientists are best friends of top American and European scientists. These people can work together like that. So, I think it may be time for some of our political leaders to let bygones be bygones.

Liu Xin: I hope that is the case, too. Let's talk a bit about the new variant, the kind of threat that COVID-19 continues to pose to us. Now, at this moment, a new variant called Mu has just been added to the WHO's list of variants of interests. And cases of this variant have been reported in the U.S., in Colombia, and the Republic of Korea and Europe. How serious a threat is this likely to pose based on what we saw about Delta already? Dr. Sten Vermund: We don't know yet. We simply don't have enough information. The same is true for Lambda variant, which was also described not long ago. RNA viruses mutate at very high rates. And that's true for HIV, that's true for influenza, and it's true for coronavirus. Because we have so many people around the world who are infected with coronavirus, the replication happening in humans is happening, multiplies by millions and millions of people. So there inevitably will be variants that emerge that are not self-destructing. Most variants cause a defect in the virus that makes it less competitive and less able to replicate. But occasionally, a mutation, such as the one in the Delta variant, can actually give the virus a competitive advantage in survival. That's why in my state of Connecticut here in the United States, it's almost all Delta, because it's crowded out the other variants. Liu Xin: Is there anything that people can do to try to tame or at least slow down the rate of mutation? Or it's really out of our control, and we can only try to catch up with the speed of vaccination and to add booster shots, to try to tame the new variants? Dr. Sten Vermund: There are definitely two things that people can do to try to help tame variants. Number one is to get vaccinated because if you stimulate your immune response to see the virus through the vaccine, and then if you do get infected later on, we would expect much milder disease. And that will likely reflect much less viral activity and viral replication. Second way is what China has done, which is a rigorous public health application of classic tools, such as masks, physical distancing, control of transportation, indoor air quality, outdoor activities, widespread testing, hand hygiene. So, all of these traditional public health strategies also reduce replication of virus by limiting viral spread.

Liu Xin: So, there are two different kinds of approach. One is what China does - try to get it down to zero. And the other is like, for instance, in the UK where they vaccinate as many people as possible, but then try to live with it. And then you have something, which is happening in the United States. You have a certain population, which refuses to be vaccinated. So, in this kind of mixture of responses, is the virus always going to find some kind of free room to develop, to flourish, and to mutate and continue to exist? How long is it going to last? Dr. Sten Vermund: If in places like the UK and the U.S. we can achieve herd immunity, such that enough people are vaccinated, that the rest of the transmission cycle sort of dies out. You end up with very few new infections. Because if you have an infectious person, but most of the people around this person are immune, then that's severely limits the spread of the virus. China can accomplish the same thing with widespread vaccination. So at that point, perhaps society can more or less get back to normal. However, I think the donor nations, like China, the Europeans, North Americans, will be under a strong self-interested as well as humanitarian motive to help the low-income countries also vaccinate their populations. Because if we control viral spread in middle-income and high-income countries, then it will still be seen in low-income countries. So, it's in everyone's self-interest to enable them to also vaccinate. I was in the country of Chad last week in central Africa, and less than one-tenth of one percent of the population has been vaccinated to date. There are many countries that have received a small fraction of the vaccine that they need and have deployed even less. In so far as we're able to help those nations cover their population, then we can have a more definitive global solution.

Liu Xin: How about the situation in those countries that you just mentioned? For instance, of course they don't have the protection of the vaccine, but is the virus running rampant or with some traditional measures, they are able to more or less keep things under control? Dr. Sten Vermund: It's a mixed setting. Some countries like South Africa, India, Brazil have struggled mightily and have had tremendous pandemic spread. Other countries, like the one I was in, in Chad, have not seen much serious COVID today, partly because of relative isolation and strong border controls, particularly airport controls. The borders themselves are quite porous. So, people for example in N'Djamena, the capital of Chad, is right across the river from Cameroon, and the bridges are full of people coming and going all hours of the day and night. So, the borders themselves are porous, but the airports are the most notorious for people bringing virus in from far away. There, they've had very rigorous control. Testing is required before they get on the airplane, testing is required as soon as they arrive. In fact, most of the testing in Chad has been done on travelers. So, to date, they don't have a serious epidemic. And it gives us the opportunity, it's a limited window of time, to aggressively vaccinate before they have a huge surge of virus.

Chinese officials slam U.S. manipulation of COVID-19 origins tracing,"The United States has been using the COVID-19 pandemic as a tool of political manipulation against China despite China's openness, transparency and cooperation with all parties in tracking down the origins of the lethal virus, said Chinese ambassador Anwar Habibullah to Bahrain recently.

In an op-ed in Bahrain's the Daily Tribune, the ambassador said that while the international community is working hard to overcome the epidemic, ""the United States, out of its own interests, neglected the international consensus of fighting against COVID-19 corporately and scientifically.""

The so-called report on the origins of COVID-19 compiled by the U.S. intelligence community recently ""is a mendacious report made up for political purposes,"" stressed the Chinese ambassador.

""China has always followed the principles of openness, transparency, and responsibility to introduce the virus information to the world, share the genome sequence of the virus, and carry out anti-epidemic cooperation.""

The first suspicious COVID-19 case found in China was reported to local authorities on December 27, 2019 and an emergency notice was later issued. On December 31, 2019, China reported relevant information to the World Health Organization (WHO), the diplomat said.

He stressed China has demonstrated a scientific, professional, serious, and responsible attitude from the beginning, and since last year invited WHO experts twice to China to track down patient zero.

""China's open and transparent attitude on the issue of COVID-19 origins tracing was fully affirmed by international experts,"" stated the Chinese ambassador."
Where are the blood samples from early phase of COVID-19?,The blood samples collected during the early phase of the COVID-19 outbreak in China have been kept in the Wuhan Blood Center. Why can't we use them for research now? Will the stored samples be used in future research? Check the video to find out.
China urges U.S. to support int'l origins tracing cooperation,"A Foreign Ministry spokesperson on Monday said China hopes the United States will listen to the objective and rational voices of the international community and be a supporter rather than a saboteur of international cooperation in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic and the origins tracing of the coronavirus.

Spokesperson Wang Wenbin made the remark at a daily news briefing when asked to comment on recent remarks by Jeffrey Sachs, who heads the Lancet COVID-19 Commission.

Sachs said the global response to the pandemic has been wholly inadequate and one of the main geopolitical problems might have been the failure of the United States to work with China for global solutions. He also said ""the United States should learn some good manners to work cooperatively with China, rather than trying to impose its will on that nation.""

Wang told the press that a Swiss epidemiologist, Christian Althaus, had also said that China responded correctly to the pandemic and bought the rest of the world with one to two months to prepare.

Wang stressed that the COVID-19 response and studying its origins call for solidarity, cooperation and the spirit of science. However, some in the United States have time and again tried to politicize efforts on both fronts to deflect the blame for their own botched response.

""Such irresponsible behavior has not only cost the American people dearly, but also become the greatest obstacle in international cooperation in combating the virus and tracing the origins,"" Wang said.

""We hope that the United States can heed the objective and rational voice of the international community, seek solidarity instead of confrontation, take responsibility instead of resorting to blame-shifting, be guided by science instead of politics, and support international cooperation in fighting the virus and tracing the origins instead of disrupting relevant efforts,"" said the spokesperson."

""The United States and a fistful of its allies are trying to mislead the world,"" according to an op-ed by Md Enamul Hassan published in English-language newspaper Bangladesh Post on Wednesday.

""On August 27, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence of the U.S. released a summary of the intelligence community assessment on COVID-19 origins, which is the latest example of America's above sinister intentions,"" Hassan wrote.

The opinion article, which was titled ""The world should adopt scientific attitudes to COVID-19 origin-tracing,"" argued that the U.S. and its allies were determined to foil the scientific and rational approaches of origins-tracing of the virus at any cost.

""They don't care about precious human lives. Their reckless moves compel the world to believe that the U.S. is trying to hide something fishy that happened in its territory by thwarting scientific origin-tracing of the virus, which is a must for saving humanity from the pandemic,"" Hassan added, before urging the international community to adopt scientific attitudes to the origins-tracing of COVID-19.

""They have to ignore every visible and invisible pressure from the U.S., which is crucial to save humanity from the fatal disease and prevent more pandemics in the future,"" he wrote.

According to Hassan, the origins can be traced only by promoting early case search, molecular epidemiology, animal (intermediate) host introduction, and other origins-tracing studies in multiple countries and regions around the world.

The entire process has to be fully guided by scientific evidence and only can be done in a scientific, non-political way, he added.

For more than a year, the death of a San Jose woman named Patricia Dowd on February 6, 2020 was considered America's first COVID-19 death. But a 78-year-old woman, Lovell Brown from Kansas who died on January 9, 2020, has now been found to be the first COVID-19 death in the United States, The Mercury News reported on Thursday, citing data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention."
Russia criticizes U.S. report on COVID-19 origins,"Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova has blasted a so-called investigation report on COVID-19 origins recently released by the U.S. intelligence community.

""I would like to note with regret that the publication only led to another round of insinuations around a generally important and, I emphasize, a purely scientific issue,"" Zakharova said at her weekly briefing earlier this week.

She stressed that such steps increased tensions in society and the international arena and impeded joint actions to counter the spread of the virus.

Russia has previously voiced its opposition to the politicization of COVID-19 origins tracing, Zakharova said.

""We consider it necessary to focus on finding ways in which we can develop international cooperation in fighting the pandemic, instead of using this global, human tragedy to settle scores at the interstate level and manipulate public opinion,"" she added."
Lao Foreign Ministry urges science-based COVID-19 origins-tracing,"The Lao Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Thursday stressed that using non-scientific and unprofessional bodies to conduct origins-tracing is counterproductive, after the U.S. intelligence community released a report on the origins of COVID-19.

The spokesperson also pointed out the politicization of the issue could derail collective international efforts.

""The Lao People's Democratic Republic strongly believes that only through genuine multilateralism, international cooperation and pure scientific research will we be able to overcome the prevailing challenges,"" the statement read.

Liangjiahe: Where Xi Jinping's poverty alleviation inspiration began,"10:06

In 1969, a teenager from Beijing joined 17 million Chinese students in the ""Down to the Countryside Movement,"" a campaign launched by Chairman Mao Zedong that asked urban youth to experience life by working in rural areas.



He traveled to a desolate village on the Loess Plateau in northwest China, and spent seven years living among its soft-dirt mountains and in its simple caves.



His name is Xi Jinping.



Liangjiahe, a then barren mountain village in Shaanxi Province, is now a prosperous place with modern agriculture and a booming tourism industry.

'Have meat and have it often'



Back then, life was harsh in Liangjiahe.



Xi lived in caves alongside the villagers and slept on a bed made of bricks and clay.



""People lived in poverty. They often went months without meat. What I wanted to do the most was to make it possible for the villagers not just to have meat sometimes, but to often have meat on their plates,"" said Xi, who is now Chinese president, general secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission.

After Xi became Party secretary of Liangjiahe Village in January 1974, he led villagers in a series of projects.



""These included the 'Educated Youth Dam,' the 'Educated Youth Well' ¨C which remains the source of our tap water today ¨C and later the iron mill, the supplies and sales office, the grain mill and the sewing workshop. These were only some of the good deeds he performed when he was Party secretary of Liangjiahe,"" recalled Shi Chunyang, former secretary of the CPC branch of Liangjiahe Village.



Xi decided that his top priority for the villagers would be food. He proposed improving the local soil conditions by building a dam, which would transform a large area of arid land into productive fields and improve crop yields.

A microcosm



Xi's plan to bring meat to villagers' tables has since come to fruition.



""In 1975, we saw some good results of the dam,"" Shi said. ""Firstly, the river bed could be used for farmland. Secondly, soil conditions improved, increasing yields from 1,500 kg per hectare to about 7,500 kg.""



Building on those foundations, Liangjiahe was gradually transformed over the following decades.



It has developed over 60 hectares of orchards on the mountains. It introduced photovoltaic facilities, developed aquaculture in the river and built vegetable greenhouses ¨C and now tourism development is the focus of the village.

China marks Lunar New Year with major victory in poverty alleviation,"01:01

Wednesday marks ""Lichun,"" the first solar term of the year, considered the beginning of spring. As a Chinese saying goes, ""the whole year's work depends on a good start in spring."" Chinese President Xi Jinping, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, on Wednesday visited Qianxi County in southwest China's Guizhou Province ahead of the Chinese New Year. February 12 signifies the beginning of the Chinese Lunar New Year. Various folk activities are held across the country to welcome the New Year. On the public square of Huawu Village in an ethnic Miao Township, Xi talked to villagers who were participating in festive activities, and extended his New Year's greetings to people of all ethnic groups across the country.

Experiencing local Miao culture

02:27

Roughly 10.9 percent of Guizhou's population are Miao, one of the largest ethnic minority groups in the country. To fully experience local culture, Xi later visited a manufacturing workshop for Miao embroidery in Huawu Village. ""It is also fashionable today,"" Xi told the workers present. ""It represents both the culture and industry.""

00:25

Miao are famed for their hand-made embroidery that goes back centuries. Even today, some people still weave their own cloth with dyes made with homemade indigo paste. The Chinese president also tried out wrapping huangba, a kind of yellow-colored sweet wrap made of rice that can be steamed or fried. Xi told his audience that he had never made a wrap that small before.

""[I wish you all] a happier and sweeter life,"" he said.

A model of poverty alleviation Guizhou, which used to be a provincial-level region with the biggest population of poor people, has lifted more than 9 million people out of poverty since 2012 with the gross domestic product (GDP) topping 1.78 trillion yuan ($276 billion) in 2020. On Wednesday afternoon, Xi visited Qianxi County, Bijie City where he inspected the ecological environment of a major tributary of the Wujiang River and visited local residents in Huawu Village.

The village is a case in point in the nation's massive poverty relief endeavor. It was lifted out of poverty in 2019. Bijie, tucked deep in the karst mountains of Guizhou, used to be one of China's most impoverished cities. Backed by the central government and other state organs, the city cultivated the land first, turning barren mountains into a luscious green. Then under the guidance of experts, villagers started to develop agriculture, breeding industry and rural tourism. Bijie has turned confrontation with nature into a win-win result and managed to rise above the poverty line. President Xi has called Bijie's success story ""a model of China's poverty alleviation drive.""

China delists all remaining poverty-stricken counties,"The last nine poverty-stricken counties in southwest China's Guizhou Province have been officially removed from the poverty list, the provincial government announced on Monday. They were also the last remaining poverty-stricken counties in China. China has vowed to eradicate absolute poverty by 2020 ¨C a major task in its drive to complete the building of a moderately prosperous society in all respects. At the end of 2019, 52 counties in the northwest, southwest and south of the country remained on the poverty list: nine in Yunnan Province, 10 in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, one in Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, seven in Sichuan Province, eight in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, eight in Gansu Province and nine in Guizhou Province.

Assessment by third-party agencies earlier this month showed that the poverty incidence in the nine counties in Guizhou decreased to zero percent and that the satisfaction rate among locals was over 99 percent, said Li Jian, director of the provincial poverty alleviation and development office, at a press briefing.



The average annual net income of impoverished people in these nine counties has risen to 11,487 yuan (about $1,740), well above the 4,000-yuan (about $609) national poverty line set this year, Li said.

A program to relocate poor rural residents has contributed significantly to Guizhou's success in poverty reduction. About 1.88 million people living in poor mountainous areas have been relocated to urban areas, according to provincial authorities. Various supporting measures have been taken to ensure that at least one person on average in each relocated household gets employed.



Meanwhile, the development of local specialty industries, such as vegetables, edible fungi and tea, has increased the income of rural residents."
"China's fighting poverty, so why are the media so skeptical?","October 17 marks China's National Poverty Relief Day. This year is significant, as it's the year China vowed to eradicate extreme poverty in rural areas ¨C a goal it says it's on track to meet, despite the chaos unleashed by COVID-19 earlier this year.

There's lots to celebrate. Over the past seven decades, China has lifted around 850 million people out of poverty, according to data from the World Bank, accounting for more than 70 percent of global poverty alleviation. In 2012, the number of impoverished people in rural areas was almost 99 million. By the end of 2019, that number fell to 5.5 million. In 2020, China's on the final stretch.

How has China managed to do it?

Different measures for different communities have helped: micro-loans, e-commerce, and access to education and healthcare. Millions of residents from rural areas have been moved to subsidized apartments with basic and modern facilities, something they couldn't afford before. Some of these moves have sparked controversy, but in the end, millions of people are living a healthier life with more opportunities than before.

Alleviating poverty in China is good news for China, of course. But it's also good news for the world. Ending poverty tops the 17 United Nations 2030 Sustainable Development Goals ¨C a goal that's becoming more elusive given the COVID-19 crisis. But if eradicating poverty can be achieved in such a big, formerly impoverished country like China, there's hope that other countries can figure out a way to address poverty in a way that works for them.

But when you look at some media reports on China's efforts, what do you see? Skepticism over China's motivations, methods, and sustainability. Some of the points are justified ¨C such a huge endeavor inevitably raises concerns. But sometimes it feels as if China just can't catch a break!

For example, a Financial Times article from June 26 reads: ""Inside China's race to beat poverty: Xi Jinping has vowed to eradicate extreme rural deprivation by the end of 2020. Will he meet his target?""

The article highlights the complexities of the task by interviewing people with different views. Some villagers have been given heavily subsidized apartments, it says, and that ""The villagers allocated these flats are happy to have them"" since ""On the mountain top, their earthen houses are exposed to the rain, as well as fatal rock slides.""

It also profiles people who aren't so happy ¨C either because the Chinese government is doing too much by forcing people to move, or not doing enough, since many people who want to move don't meet the requirements. Those people say the ""local government has overlooked them.""

Fair enough, but sometimes it seems China can do no right. Yes, tackling poverty is a huge and imperfect undertaking, but you've got to start somewhere, right?

Some media also predicted COVID-19 would derail China's efforts to meet its 2020 goal. A CNN article from July 2, 2020 read, ""Ending poverty in 2020 was going to be Xi's crowning achievement. Coronavirus might have ruined it.""

Big dreams laid to waste is how the story appears framed here. The article says, ""This was supposed to be the year that Beijing would announce it had ended absolute poverty in China, fulfilling a key pledge of President Xi Jinping and one of the founding missions of the Chinese Communist Party. Then the novel coronavirus pandemic tore through the global economy.""

It's true that the pandemic has been excruciating for every country in the world, not just for China. And it's also true that the virus hit China very hard earlier this year. But just how much has COVID-19 changed China's goal? Judging by the current numbers, not much, if at all.

China's Q1 saw a 6.8% decline, yes. But by Q2, the GDP growth was already 3.2%, a sharp contrast to other Q2 economies around the world. China's Q3 is expected to be even stronger. In fact, the IMF said China will be the only major economy likely to grow this year, and predicted China's growth will accelerate to 8.2% in 2021.

In other words, yes, COVID threw a wrench into the works this year, but China's anti-poverty goals remain on track. That's something the whole world can celebrate this year.

What are the institutional designs of China's poverty reduction drive?,"From relief-based poverty alleviation drive to development-oriented poverty alleviation program and then to targeted poverty alleviation, China has embarked on a distinctive development-oriented poverty alleviation path.

The goal of China's poverty reduction governance is to completely eliminate absolute poverty by the end of 2020. At the same time, China has actively carried out international exchanges and cooperation on poverty reduction to promote the global poverty reduction process.

Poverty alleviation is a critical task that runs through the 70-year development trajectory of China. The work from the early days of the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949 to 1978 was mainly relief-type poverty alleviation.

Since 1978 when China began to implement economic reform and opening-up policies, poverty alleviation has gone through the stage of systemic reform, during which large-scale development-oriented poverty relief drive was dominant. After the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC), poverty alleviation has entered the stage of targeted poverty alleviation.

At the first stage (1949-1978), the Chinese government availed of institutional reforms to solve widespread rural poverty. Through rural land reforms, the systemic obstacles to farmers' land ownership were eliminated, while the rural infrastructure was improved, with development of education and healthcare services going full steam ahead. Agricultural technology was widely promoted during the period, and a social security system was established.

In the interim, rural residents' living conditions were greatly improved, the total grain output surged by 169 percent, the infant mortality rate dropped by 75 percent, the life expectancy of the population extended by nearly 30 years, and the proportion of the rural population below survival levels plummeted by 50 percent.

The second is the stage (1978-2012) where development-type poverty alleviation was closely integrated with national strategies, and the outcomes of regional poverty governance became prominent. China has successively promulgated and implemented the Seven-Year Priority Poverty Reduction Program (1994-2000) and the Outline for Poverty Reduction and Development of China's Rural Areas (2001-2010), promulgating a development-oriented poverty alleviation policy.

It designated poverty-stricken counties and contiguous areas of extreme poverty, established a four-level poverty alleviation system from the central government to the county level, and formed a coordination mechanism in the fields of infrastructure construction, agriculture, water conservancy, transportation, power, and communications. At the national strategy level, it promoted planned and organized large-scale poverty alleviation actions.

Since the 18th CPC National Congress held in late 2012, China embraced a new era featuring targeted poverty alleviation. The central government solemnly pledged to eliminate absolute poverty across the country by 2020 and implemented targeted poverty alleviation, creating the best achievement in the history of poverty reduction in China. It has become a country with the most impressive poverty reduction record in the world.

In November 2013, Chinese President Xi Jinping put forward the idea of ""targeted"" or ""precision"" poverty alleviation for the first time in a poverty-stricken county in central China's Hunan Province, saying ""We should take targeted measures based on actual conditions and avoid empty slogans.""

""Targeted"" refers to personal concerns with supportive policies, including identification standards for the impoverished and customized plans and programs to lift everyone out of poverty. It first defines absolute poverty by using a standardized method of annual income. It also includes tests for proper healthcare, education, and sanitation.

A variety of methods for poverty alleviation are employed in light of specific scenarios: industry, creating a sustainable micro-business; relocating, moving people from remote areas; education and training; ecological compensation for those living in environmentally vulnerable areas; and social security, medical subsidies and direct payments to those who cannot work.

It is guaranteed that every impoverished family will receive timely help, and each village has full-time officials designated for taking specific measures. The secretaries of local party committees at the provincial, municipal, county, township, village levels coordinated their role to help the poor. In addition, in order to ensure the accuracy and authenticity of the poverty alleviation effect, third-party assessments will be conducted regularly and randomly.

As targeted poverty alleviation strategies came into practice in 2012, China has notched up the most impressive achievement in poverty reduction history, lifting some 90 million people in merely seven years and bringing down the incidence of poverty from 10.2 to 0.6 percent.

As of end-2018, 436 out of 832 poverty-stricken counties across the country had been lifted out of poverty, with the number of registered poverty-stricken villages plummeting from 128,000 to 26,000. When delivering the New Year's speech, President Xi noted another 340 poor counties got rid of poverty in 2019, or rather, more than 10 million people were lifted out of poverty.

Poverty governance has driven up the income of rural residents. In 2018, the per capita disposable income of rural residents in poverty-stricken areas reached to the tune of 10,371 yuan, 1.7 times that of 2013. The real income growth rate from 2013 through 2018 averaged 10 percent, which was 2.3 percentage points higher than the national rural average.

In 2018, the per capita disposable income of rural residents in poverty-stricken areas was equivalent to 71 percent of the national rural average, an increase of 8.9 percentage points from 2012, and its gap with the national rural average was further narrowed. In 2019, the per capita disposable income of rural residents in poverty-stricken areas settled on 11,567 yuan, a nominal increase of 11.5 percent over the previous year."
China-ASEAN cooperation on poverty alleviation amid COVID-19,"For more than seven months, the pandemic has jeopardized the economic and social improvements humans have achieved in many decades, throwing billions of people into poverty. Among the impacted, Asian countries, with undeveloped social security systems and numerous informal workers, have borne the brunt of it.

Informal workers account for nearly 60 percent of non-farm employment in the Asia Pacific.

The pandemic may push 100 million more people into extreme poverty, almost half of whom live in South Asia, Beate Trankmann, UNDP China's country director said during the 2020 Extraordinary ASEAN-China Social Development and Poverty Reduction Forum on Wednesday.

She asserted that two-thirds of the sustainable development goals (SDGs) adopted in 2015 to improve people's lives by 2030 are now unlikely to be met, adding that vulnerable groups including the poor, small-scale farmers, women, children and disabled people are disproportionately affected by the pandemic.

Before the COVID-19 outbreak, ASEAN countries were applauded for their remarkable progress in poverty alleviation. The poverty rate in the member countries declined from 47 percent in 1990 to 15 percent in 2015, according to Kung Phoak, deputy secretary-general of the ASEAN Secretariat. He said at that pace, absolute poverty would have declined substantially and be eradicated in most ASEAN countries by 2030, but now the achievement is under risk.

With the pandemic costing trillions of dollars and leading to a global economic depression, it's unlikely to have enough money for many governments, especially those in underdeveloped countries, to banish poverty and inequality by 2030.

Data released by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) estimated that growth in the Southeast Asian region will decelerate to only one percent in 2020, which means many of those lifted out of absolute poverty would be at risk of falling back into poverty.

""In this difficult time, we must solidify cooperation and partnership. No country alone can effectively deal with the complexities of the pandemic and its adverse effects. Certainly, ASEAN stands ready to join hands with our partners, including China,"" Kung Phoak said during the virtual meeting."
Mapping Xi Jinping's poverty alleviation tours from 2016-2020,"""For more than 40 years, I've worked in counties, cities, provinces and the central government of China. Poverty alleviation has always been a vital part of my work and I devoted most of my vigor to it."" ¨C Xi Jinping



In 2020, China has accomplished on schedule its poverty alleviation target for the new era, a significant victory that has impressed the world.



Through eight years of sustained work, China has lifted nearly 100 million poor people out of poverty, and all of its 832 poverty-stricken counties have been delisted.

Chinese President Xi Jinping, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission, has convened a series of meetings on poverty alleviation. Before every such meeting, he would visit impoverished regions to conduct research, learn about the local situation and hear opinions of grassroots officials and members of the public. Since 2012, Xi has set foot on 14 contiguous areas of dire poverty, featuring highly concentrated poverty and poor development conditions.

In 2016, when he visited a village in northwestern Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, Xi checked the shower facility in a villager's home, and was pleased to learn that the family had a solar water heater.



Recalling his early trips to some poor areas, Xi said his heart sank when he saw the bumpy and rugged roads, harsh living conditions of the locals and heard stories of children dropping out of school, or patients not getting treated in time.



""But when I went to poor villages in these few years, I saw substantial changes,"" Xi said at a March symposium. ""Seeing people's smiles, I am delighted.""



China readjusted its poverty line in 2011, raising it to 2,300 yuan ($352) annualy£­an increase of 80 percent over 1,274 yuan ($195) from 2010. Since then, the standard has been raised annually taking into account inflation and other factors. The poverty line for 2020 is 4,000 yuan ($612).

China's poverty-eradication standard, in fact, cannot be defined by income numbers alone. Besides lifting the annual income, the country's basic poverty-eradication campaign also helps ensure that the poor have sufficient food and clothing, as well as access to compulsory education, basic medical services and safe housing."
Eradicating extreme poverty in 2020: Did China set the bar too low?,"China wants to eliminate extreme poverty and build a moderately prosperous society in all respects by 2020.

The COVID-19 pandemic is estimated to push an additional 88 million to 115 million people into extreme poverty globally this year, with the total rising to as many as 150 million by 2021, depending on the severity of the economic contraction, according to the World Bank.

Despite this, China's anti-poverty goals remain on track. Besides the efforts made to battle against poverty over the past decades, the country's thorough epidemic prevention work also played a part in stabilizing a pandemic-hit economy earlier than the rest of the world.

Upon completion of the poverty eradication task this year, China will achieve the goals set in the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development 10 years ahead of schedule. This is of great significance to both China and the world, as no country in the world has ever lifted so many people out of poverty in such a short period of time, said Chinese President Xi Jinping at a symposium on securing a decisive victory in poverty alleviation earlier this year.

However, there are those that remain skeptical of the country's poverty alleviation work, arguing that China's poverty line is far below what is set by the World Bank."
Third-party inspector of poverty relief work,"13:35

©§ ""I simply think I'm just doing something good."" ©§ Xuan Xuan, assessment team member Xuan Xuan, a 24-year-old graduate student from Lanzhou University, told CGTN her experience as a first-timer on the third-party assessment team in Zhenyuan County, northwest China's Gansu Province.

What is 'third-party assessment?'

Third-party assessment is a method to verify the authenticity of local assertions that a county is poverty-free. The assessment teams consist of people from all walks of life and use well-developed survey techniques. Their job is to go to the declared poverty-free areas and conduct multi-dimensional assessment and inspection work to ensure that there is no misevaluation, under-evaluation or the possibility of a return to poverty. Zhenyuan County declared itself poverty-free in October 2020. Located in the center of northwestern China, the area had a totally different scenario six years ago. The county is surrounded by the Loess Plateau and sits at an average elevation of 1,400 meters. Harsh environmental conditions restricted its economic and cultural development. According to data provided by the local government, around 17,000 people were living below the poverty line in 2014 ¨C that number now stands at zero.

Eliminating absolute poverty also means the area has to accept supervision and inspection from all parties. On November 2, a team of 79 members like Xuan Xuan joined the five-day provincial third-party assessment. They were divided into eight groups and went to various townships in Zhenyuan County to conduct inspections. ""For many students, this is not the first time they've joined poverty alleviation work,"" Professor Chang Genying, who leads the assessment, told CGTN.

Are students qualified to do the job?

It is worth noting that the team members were mostly postgraduate and undergraduate students around the age of 24, majoring in different fields such as architecture, engineering and education. This seems to be different from our understanding of the usual investigation work for poverty alleviation as it requires very professional skills. Some questions were raised - Whether these students are qualified? How do they ensure the evaluation work is successfully carried out? And how can they guarantee its authenticity and accuracy?

©§¡°Who do they think are qualified to do this job other than university students then?¡± ©§ Yang Zeyi, assessment team member

""There is a long process before you can become an evaluator. We have to go through a lot of training and exams to get qualified,"" Yang Zeyi added.

""I've done this job more than five times now. You have to take part in the training before you start this job properly,"" Wang Xuyang, an experienced team leader, said, explaining to CGTN the training details. ""We attended the training in a huge classroom and the participants all came to the training voluntarily. Our professor would explain to us what poverty alleviation is, the specific detail of the government's poverty alleviation policy, and how to communicate with farmers. Because the causes of poverty vary from place to place, the adopted strategies also need to be different to ensure that we can obtain the most accurate data possible.¡±

Students who finish the training have to take an online exam. ""The exam covers every detail of the policy, and even includes the barriers faced when communicating with locals,"" Wang Xuyang added.

What is the workflow?

According to the third-party assessment requirements, the team needs to have a complete workflow.

The assessment team members randomly select the towns and villages to be spot-checked before departure. And based on the population data of the previous local census, the priority is to select the absolutely poor households that have been registered for verification. The members will then visit the farmers' homes, communicate with them in depth to understand their production and living conditions, income situation, and inspect the family's basic livelihood security such as housing, food and drinking water safety.

In order to ensure the standardization and consistency of the evaluation outcomes, the team adopted a unified measurement standard that was implemented based on a mobile application called ""Targeted Poverty Alleviation"" throughout out the entire field visit.

""Our questionnaires are formed from the app. Based on the poverty alleviation standards set by the country, we ask the interviewees questions as well as check the relevant materials, including bank statements, deposit and withdrawal details, housing appraisal certificates, etc. to check that the corresponding indicators such as income and housing meet the standards,"" Wang Xuyang emphasized. ""In the entire investigation process, local officials are absolutely not allowed to interfere or participate.""

In addition, the team is also responsible for assessing local officials' jobs. By chatting with the farmers and asking them questions, the team will then determine whether the corresponding village support cadres regularly visit the farmer households to understand their situation, whether they have helped the farmers solve problems, and if the cadres are disciplined. The group leaders will also examine the effectiveness of the village cadres' work by conducting one-to-one conversations with them to check their mastery of the area under their jurisdiction as well as their understanding of specific issues and details of the farmers.

After the daily on-site inspections, the third-party assessment team members have to collect and audit the statistics. They will have to conduct a second investigation if there is doubtful content and only upload to the evaluation system after ensuring that the information is correct. They will report verified issues to the relevant departments so that the farmers can get as much help as possible.

What are the challenges?

Technically, data normalization problems could be solved based on the unified questionnaire as well as the in-depth training for the assessment members. However, it is another obstacle that needs to be resolved when it comes to the authenticity of the result.

©§""The hardest part wasn't asking them questions. It's the communication with the farmers."" ©§ Xuan Xuan, assessment team member

Human communication is something that can't be normalized or replaced by any tool. In China, where numerous accents and dialects exist, communicating with farmers who had strong northwestern accents had no doubt become a challenge for the team members who are from all over China.

""I could understand very little at the beginning. I had to ask them to repeat themselves over and over again to understand what they were saying,"" Xuan Xuan said, explaining the problem she faced as a native of central China's Henan Province. As the work progressed, she became more familiar with the dialect and local accent. ""I could understand more later on,"" she added.

However, the dialect and accent weren't the only communication problem. The difficulty farmers had expressing themselves was more of a barrier. Most of the absolute poverty is caused by objective reasons such as disabilities or diseases, which made it impossible for the people to receive education, hence their limited ability to express themselves. ""We have to listen carefully to what they want to say and then ask questions based on the details from their response. We can't miss a single detail,"" Yang Zeyi said.

""Some farmers tend to hide what they have from us,"" Wang Xuyang said. Thanks to China's targeted poverty alleviation actions, many poor households benefit from direct economic subsidies and some of them had already gotten out of poverty with the policy dividend. However, ""they may be unwilling to reveal their extra assets to us for some reason,"" Wang pointed out, and one farmer ""would not say anything without us asking. This will directly lead to the distortion of the data we collect.""

Inaccurate statistics will have a big impact on the subsequent poverty alleviation work. In order to solve this problem, the evaluators from the assessment team will communicate with the village and township officials regarding the interviewed household's property-related issues. They will then investigate whether the family has joined the relevant organizations and institutions that help them obtain income and whether the household has received the due funds so as to finally determine whether it reaches economic indicators of poverty alleviation.

What is the assessment for?

Poverty is the biggest obstacle to the realization of human rights. Alleviating poverty can effectively promote the realization of the right to development for the poor. In order to achieve this goal, there is still a lot more that needs to be done.

""Poverty alleviation is to help people stand on their feet. But growing taller requires people to put in the effort. I think that lifting people out of poverty is just a target, but the real goal lies in the hands of people,"" Xuan Xuan said with a sigh.

""We must look at this issue from a third-party objective perspective, not just listen to whatever the (local) government says. [You need to have] a more comprehensive understanding, which is actually a guarantee as a whole for our country,"" Yang Zeyi told CGTN, regarding the current poverty alleviation work at the grassroots level in China.

According to data provided by the State Council Leading Group Office of Poverty Alleviation and Development, a total of 531 counties with more than 3,200 villages and 116,000 households were surveyed on the spot as of the end of December 2020."
Checking the finishing touches to anti-poverty work in rural China,"36:30

The first time I visited Kuijiu in October 2019, the alpine village in southwest China's Sichuan Province seemed like a worst-case scenario for anyone taking on poverty. A lot was going against it: a godforsaken location, barren lands that barely provided sustenance for the residents and a population in extreme poverty. But the future, uncertain as it was, promised a respite. China had vowed that extreme poverty in the countryside would be history by the end of 2020, and last September I was back in town to see if villagers would pull through in time. The transformation of Kuijiu could be felt from miles away. Setting out from our hotel in Butuo, the closest county to the village, I buckled up for the almost hour-long journey I've come to dread during my first visit. I visualized the route in my head. We'll cruise down a highway before a nondescript turn takes us off the road and onto vertiginous paths of dirt and gravel. The car will shake violently before stopping so we could finish the last stretch on foot. I was as ready as I'll ever be.

Kuijiu is hemmed in by mountains. The scenery is breathtaking, but everyday life is harsh. /CGTN Kuijiu is hemmed in by mountains. The scenery is breathtaking, but everyday life is harsh. /CGTN

But that day, our driver pulled over a few streets away from the hotel. My producer pointed to a parked bus, and her gesture was enough to put a smile on my face. Kuijiu can now be reached via a paved road. To be sure, the bus ride was not bump-free but the anticipation masked any discomfort. Passengers, with bags and cartons overflowing with produce, got off one after another until I and the filming crew were the only ones left. Kuijiu was the last stop on the bus route and there, I reunited with familiar faces. Shen Rui, a resident poverty alleviation official who showed me the ropes last time I was here, seemed to be a shell of his previous buoyant self. He had shed some weight but wasn't any less energetic than before. Yang Bo, an older team member who introduced me and the villagers to the seven-step handwashing technique well before COVID-19 popularized it, was also looking thinner, but surprisingly younger, than when I last saw him.

In less than a year, a new road was built, connecting Kuijiu to other villages and beyond. /CGTN In less than a year, a new road was built, connecting Kuijiu to other villages and beyond. /CGTN

It was very obvious that stress from the job had taken its toll on these men. They were just weeks away from the self-imposed deadline, and it was only a matter of time before inspectors arrived ¨C some announced, some not. There was no room for mistakes, and even though the bulk of the work had been done, tying up loose ends was still a mammoth task. A household needed to meet a long list of criteria before it is officially crossed off the poverty list. The requirements touched different aspects of life ¨C finances, accommodation, basic amenities, living conditions, and a lot more. Plumbing problems, roof cracks, even TVs without cable could land Rui and his colleagues in serious trouble when auditors arrive for assessment. My visit couldn't have come at a worse time, but they were happy to have me. The first order of business was to check a new resettlement community on the mountaintop.

These new houses were built as part of the country's poverty alleviation project in Kuijiu. They're a few hundred meters away from the mud-brick houses the villages used to live in. /CGTN These new houses were built as part of the country's poverty alleviation project in Kuijiu.

Still under construction when I was in town in late 2019, the houses have since been finalized and furnished. A stone's throw away from the shaky sheds with earthen floors and thatched roofs that residents once called home, the new dwellings were nevertheless light-years away in design, comfort, and safety. The alterations, cosmetic as they may seem, spell possibilities and opportunities. The new road breaks the isolation factor and helps this village lost in time make its leap into modernity. Farmers can now sell any surplus in the county's markets, students have fewer excuses to skip school and sick people no longer have to put off going to the doctor because of inconvenient transportation. I also thought of the new houses as a chance to start afresh. Some families were already hard at work to settle in and make the space their own. One was building an overhang atop the front gate of their courtyard, another had decorated the walls with posters and stickers, and a few were installing TV satellite dishes. But as we hopped from one house to another, it became clear that the pretty fa?ade hid some flaws ¨C malfunctioning light switches, wonky door locks, loose window frames. Water was also out and we later discovered a leaking pipe was to blame.

Rui was uncomfortable, but not for the reasons I had expected. He didn't mind dealing with the extra work. A phone call to technicians would make these problems disappear in no time. If need be, he was willing to roll up his sleeves and do the repairs himself, and indeed we ended up changing the defective hoses ourselves. What frustrated him was the reluctance of the new homeowners to deal with the smaller issues on their own, or at least actively ask for help from Rui or his team instead of sitting tight. They had been holding the hands of villagers for years now, and it was soon time to let go. Rui needed to know that locals will be able to pick up where the team had left after they left, but seeing many still lacked initiative put him in a bad mood. ""What will happen when we're gone?"" he said in a defeated tone. My tongue was tied, and I couldn't help but wonder just how long he'd been choking on this fear before he finally spat it out. The question kept playing over and over in my head, but the tasks at hand were a good distraction. A couple of students were ditching class and needed an intervention. A widowed mother of two was resisting moving into her new home because it had no space for her pigs and chickens and sought assurance that leaving them behind will not be a costly mistake. Her neighbors, an elderly couple, required assistance in dealing with a clogged floor drain that filled their kitchen with a stench every time they turned on the faucet. At the headquarters, the poverty relief team was busy crunching numbers, going over villagers' finances and cross checking medical reimbursement forms.

Plenty in Kuijiu boggled me. Children without parents raising themselves. Young adults choosing to work in the fields over plowing through a book. Toddlers putting in their mouth whatever scrap they dug out of dirt under the watch of their mothers. And the collective calm, bordering on nonchalance, in the face of water outage. Being alone with my thoughts felt overbearing, even more so frustrating. It seemed impossible to understand what my eyes were registering without falling into the trap of passing judgement, making assumptions or rushing into hasty conclusions. Most nights ended with a brain freeze and a sense of malaise that seeped into my patchy sleep. I was struggling to make sense of a reality that wasn't mine, but so were the villagers. A life of scarcity was all they knew and this new world with paved roads, safe roofs and children going to class is foreign and strange and has yet to sink in.

A few kilometers from the launch site, local farmers in Honghai Village of Longlou have found a way to cash in on their hometown's newfound fame with the one thing it has always been famous for ¨C coconuts. Before China's space program put Wenchang on the map, it was known as the ""home of coconuts"" with a rich culture centered on the tropical fruit, which grows abundantly in the area. At the Honghai Coconut Carving Farmers' Co-op, a small workshop converted from an abandoned farmhouse, local artist Wang Feihai has been leading a group of some 30 villagers to make traditional handicrafts out of coconut wood and shells, known as coconut carvings.

The co-op was the brainchild of Zhu Hongwen, the team leader of rural work in Honghai Village. When he arrived in 2019, Zhu quickly noticed a disconnect between Longlou's booming tourism and the rural community. ""Many farmers stopped working after their lands were expropriated for construction. People here would even make jokes about girls marrying into the village because it is poor,"" he told CGTN. Most of the villagers are left-behind seniors, who don't have other skills or education to get employed elsewhere, Zhu said. After thoroughly surveying the village, he took a keen interest in coconut carving. ""Coconut carving is characteristic of Wenchang and eco-friendly. The idea is to help the farmers benefit from space tourism and earn a living at their doorsteps,"" Zhu said. With help from local artisans, the coconut carving co-op came into being in December 2019. From its conception, the initiative has been met with doubts and resistance from some old-fashioned local officials, who don't see the point in such a time-consuming endeavor. ""They think that after I leave the village in a few years, no one will care,"" Zhu said. But Hu Hele, Party secretary of the village committee, took Zhu's side. ""It is flexible work which the farmers can do in their free time,"" Hu said, pointing at two women at work, who had been polishing some lampshades. Both women are from low-income families, and now they each can earn at least 1,000 yuan more a month after joining the co-op, Hu told CGTN. Besides this, Hu believes this time-honored craft is something the villagers will easily warm to because of their natural affinity with coconuts. ""Coconut is our culture. We want to promote our culture,"" he said.

With a history of more than 1,000 years, coconut carving is a treasured heritage in Wenchang. In 2008, Hainan coconut carving was listed an intangible cultural heritage in China. At the Wenchang Coconut Carving Exhibition Center, exquisite works from renowned artisan Fu Shiqiong, the province's only inheritor of the artistry, are on display for visitors to learn about the natives' love for all things coconut. Fu's proteges, a handful in number including Wang Feihai, have been on a mission to pass down the skills. Wang returned to the village in 2010 after living over 20 years in southern China's Guangdong Province, where he attended art school. After Wenchang became synonymous with China's aerospace city, Wang saw the opportunity of a lifetime to be a part of his hometown's development.

""We hope to use this handicraft to contribute to the rural economy. In this way, we can put our craft to good use,"" Wang said, painstakingly adding the finishing touch to a souvenir through a pair of reading glasses. The co-op has so far organized three training sessions for beginners, while experienced artists draw up some simple designs that ordinary villagers can try their hands at. The cut-out lamps Wang designed have been a success story, after a Thailand-based client saw the samples via Zhu's Douyin account and reached out for a purchase. Encouraged by their first overseas order, Zhu has enlisted the help of social media-savvy college students, who visit the village regularly to promote local products via livestreaming. Wang, on the other hand, is not too excited about the exposure just yet. The artist is adamant that every carving is entirely handmade, and worried that too much too soon could result in lower quality.

Latest census data reveal the state of poverty in the U.S.,"U.S. Census data released this week shows that the poverty rate hit 11.4 percent in 2020, up from 10.5 percent a year prior.

It's the first increase in poverty after five consecutive years of declines.

There were 37.2 million people living below the poverty line in the United States in 2020. The definition of poverty ranges from $12,413 to $57,597 in annual income depending on the number of people in the family unit, and if the family had children under the age of 18.

Had it not been for government aid given to Americans during the COVID-19 pandemic, the estimated number of people in poverty would have increased to 54.4 million or about 17 percent of the population."

Clubs in Tanzania promoting Kung Fu,"In the downtown area of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania's commercial capital, Saidi Mfaume, dressed in white attire, was leading people in practicing Kung Fu (Chinese martial arts).

""Kung Fu is not only an entertainment,"" beamed the 35-year-old Tanzanian Kung Fu teacher.

Mfaume, father of a two-year-old daughter, who owns Shaolin Temple Tanzania Kung Fu Club in Dar es Salaam, trained in China's Shaolin Temple in Henan province for three months in 2013 under the sponsorship of the Chinese government.

The Kung Fu teacher said in 2014 the Chinese government offered him another scholarship for a short course training on Chinese culture which helped him fully engage himself in promoting Kung Fu across Tanzania.

Mfaume said cultural exchanges between China and Tanzania are a golden opportunity, and Tanzania stands to learn a lot from China's advanced technology and development.

""With Kung Fu training, doors to a bright future are open. What we need to do is to train our young men,"" said the teacher.

At the very beginning, Mfaume felt that there was still slow response in Kung Fu training in the country because a section of the population thought that Kung Fu is connected to criminality, which is completely wrong.

With the spread of Kung Fu education, public awareness is changing. ""People now believe that Kung Fu is a good martial art intended to discipline and to protect our youth from various dangerous situations,"" he added.

According to him, he has trained over 1,000 people after he had opened Kung Fu clubs in several regions in Tanzania, including Tanga, Lindi, Dodoma, and Mbeya.

He said, movie makers across the world are looking for good Kung Fu trainees like the ones he is grooming in Tanzania.

""Kung Fu can create employment by performing in action movies. One can become a super star through acting in a movie,"" said Mfaume.

Hamad Abdallah is one of the Kung Fu trainees at the club. He learned about Shaolin Temple through social media.

""Since I started cultivating interest in Kung Fu from when I was a child, I decided to join the Shaolin Temple (Tanzania Kung Fu Club) and my family supported me to join the training,"" said the 18-year-old student from Makongo Juu Secondary School in Dar es Salaam.

""Kung Fu has improved my health. It has inculcated discipline in me and it has also improved my self-defense,"" said Abdallah.

""I have trained for two years now and my focus is to become a Kung Fu super star and become a world renowned actor,"" said the student as he joined his evening training.

He said he is looking forward to visiting China, adding that he is also looking forward to participating in international Kung Fu competitions."
Mantis Fist: Routines in martial arts reflect the philosophy of life,"05:07

Mantis Fist is one of the four famous fists from east China's Shandong Province. This treasured Chinese martial arts technique dates back to the end of the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644). It belongs to the category of pictographic fists. Legend has it that a man named Wang Lang based the technique on the moves of a mantis hunting cicadas. It has no blocking position and all the moves are offensive.

This technique embodies the strengths of many martial arts schools in the late Ming and early Qing dynasties. It focuses on the element of offense as opposed to pliability in those techniques. Xu Xueli is the eighth-generation inheritor of the Mantis Fist. He started practicing the technique at age of 7 and entered the provincial team at 16. At 31, he became a martial arts coach. He has dedicated his entire life to martial arts. At the age of 78, he feels he still has much to achieve. ""I think the martial art is worth being learned and studied for a lifetime,"" Xu said.

During his 70 years of practice, Xu has researched a lot on fist routines while improving his skills. Mantis has a long dorsum. The practitioners need to work on making their waist flexible and their back stretchable to a certain point. In addition, the moves are rapid. The idea is to exploit the opponent's weak spot, and if there isn't any, break the defense.

""During the battle, if I see room, I go through and attack. If there isn't any, I have to go directly and break through the defense,"" Xu said. The style, in general, is about rapid attacks and getting into a brave momentum. For Xu, it is not only a kungfu technique, but also part of science and culture. As a martial arts coach, he has the responsibility to pass on the traditional values. He wants to give his students the real deal ¨C teach them all he's got.

Huaquan Fist: Great strength generates explosive force,"07:30

One person with great strength can defeat ten who're skilled. Use tricks to win wisely. This is the essential message of Huaquan Fist. Great strength generates explosive force. Wang Yuanxiang was born into a martial art family in Cangzhou City, North China's Hebei Province. His family has been practicing and teaching Huaquan Fist since the time of Qing Dynasty (1636-1912). Having practiced the skill since childhood, Wang is now a fifth-generation inheritor of Huaquan Fist.

There is a set of similar techniques, called Zhaquan Fist. Legend has it that after the An-Shi Rebellion in the Tang Dynasty (618-907) was quelled, the patriotic generals and soldiers stayed in ancient Cangzhou and founded the Zhahua school. Zha Shangyi and Hua Zongqi were fellow apprentices of the same master. Zha and his disciples practiced Zhaquan Fist, while Hua and his disciples practiced Huaquan Fist.

Many of their moves are very similar, therefore the two are inseparable. The close relationship is also Wang's expectation of martial arts. He named his martial art club Tuanjie (solidarity) Club. In his opinion, martial arts are a kind of culture. He is of the view that all kung fu schools should unite and inherit Chinese martial arts jointly. No matter what school, fist or nation you identify with, ""we need mutual respect and communication; this is my hope.""

To achieve his wish, Wang has kept practicing and reviewing fist formulas for decades. He practices with a wooden dummy, thousand pounder, hard slate, broomstick, stone padlock and traditional dunzi (a stump or stone) to increase his strength.

In all the martial art skills, speed prevails. It is essential in practicing Huaquan. ""The word 'hua' in 'Huaquan' also means to move fast and neutralize the enemy's strength and then attack again,"" says Wang. During a prolonged practice, Wang perfected his skills, as well as his systematic and profound understanding of the fist.

In all the martial art skills, speed prevails. /CGTN Photo In all the martial art skills, speed prevails. /CGTN Photo

There are four different styles of the fist, with less jumping but more hand positions. One uses both hands and feet, emphasizing hand, eye, body and step coordination. There are also many kinds of steps, like swooping, rounding, leaping and skipping. Beyond that, martial arts contains the principle of dealing with the world. Wang always believes that no matter the reason is for learning martial arts, one must adhere to the virtues and use the genre in the right way.

""I am over 70 years old. Conscience always comes first in martial art practice and before anything else,"" says Wang. Wang's granddaughter practices with him as the seventh generation of the family. It has been hundreds of years since the foundation of Huaquan Fist. It is the persistence of countless practitioners that allows Chinese martial arts to be passed down through generations."
Miaodao saber: An important cold weapon from ancient battlefields,"08:01

The miaodao saber, also known as ""long saber"" in ancient times, gets its name from the slender shape of a seedling. It is a precious cultural legacy of China. Miaodao can be used both as a blade and a spear, with one or both hands. In actual combats, the weapon is mainly aimed at the opponent's upper body, like the head, shoulders, arms or chest.

It has been recognized as an intangible cultural heritage of China. Originating in the Han Dynasty (202BC-220AD) and having reached its peak in the Tang Dynasty (618-907), miaodao has a history of more than a thousand years. The weapon's shape determines the fighting technique. The back of the thick blade is used to fend off the enemy's weapon. The tip is pretty straight and suitable for stabbing. Miaodao can't be easily fractured like a regular sword. With the advent of cavalries, it became an essential cold weapon in ancient battlefields.

The miaodao saber could be used single-handedly or with both hands. /CGTN The miaodao saber could be used single-handedly or with both hands. /CGTN

With only a few written records, miaodao techniques have been passed down by word of mouth for a long time. Located in north China's Hebei Province, Cangzhou City is known as the hometown of Chinese martial arts. Martial arts have been a part of local traditions for hundreds of years. Many techniques and weapons, including miaodao, have been passed down among these people. Born into a martial arts family, Guo Guide began practicing with his father Guo Ruixiang when he was still a kid. As a representative inheritor of miaodao, he has some unique views on its techniques.

Hacking, lifting, cutting, and stabbing: the moves of miaodao integrate the Tongbi Fist's footwork, which is pretty flexible. According to Guo Guide, when you wield the saber, the back and the blade must be on the same track. Holding it with both hands helps release the arm's strength.

In addition to studying miaodao techniques, Guo is committed to inheriting his ancestors' legacy and editing written records for the next generations. In the 1970s, there weren't any document about the origin of miaodao. Guo's father went around doing verification to prove that it is a precious cultural heritage of China. ""My strongest recollection of my father in his late years is that he had dim eyesight, wearing glasses and a cotton-padded jacket on the shoulders. He got up at four or five o'clock every day and started writing about miaodao. He left dozens of notebooks with dense handwriting, including many of his own research results,"" Guo recalls.

Emei sword fist: A 150-year-old inherited martial art technique,"04:58

Originating in Mount Emei, a sacred mountain situated in southwest China's Sichuan Province, Emei is one of the three traditional martial arts schools in China. Known for its unique style with many branches, it features a variety of fists; among them, the Sword Fist. It was created by a monk from western Sichuan in 1860. The technique has been passed on with special characteristics for more than 150 year.

Sword Fist, as the name suggests, mainly includes finger movements to attack like a sword. Compared to other fist styles, it combines the finger movements of Chinese qigong and the flexible characteristics of Sichuan martial arts. It is characterized by quick eyes and hands and accurate pointing of fingers with great force.

As some would say: ""Getting punched might feel better than being poked."" Emei Sword Fist gathers the entire strength of your body on your fingers ¨C the reason why it bursts into such great power. The combination of fist, palm and hook positions can do great damage to attacked vital points or exposed parts of the human body.

Boasting a long history, Emei Sword Fist has a profound cultural background. But with the rapid development of human society, it also faces the threat of being lost like some other traditional treasures. Sadly, not many people practice this martial art form today.

Emei 24 close-range combat techniques,"05:36

As one of the three major schools of Chinese traditional martial arts, Emei martial arts originated around Mount Emei and became popular in southwest China's Sichuan Province. With regional features of various mountains and rivers, ancient practitioners tried to make up for the short stature of residents by seeking out the most effective fighting skills. Over time, a kind of special martial arts was formed to help the weak overcome the strong.

There is a traditional branch named Emei 24 Close-range Combat Techniques, which belongs to the School of Counteraction, one of the eight main schools of Emei martial arts. The ""24"" means there are 24 kinds of moves that are used. With agile and fierce moves, Wu Xinliang is already in his 60s. He has been practicing for more than 40 years, during which time he has won many national competitions and become a representative Emei figure.

The 24 Close-range Combat Techniques emphasize counteraction with a single hand. It's about reacting skillfully using the palms and fingers first. Wu thinks that the essence lies in actual combat. The trick is all about diversion. One can use smart tricks to lure the opponent into a trap, then make the next move. In other words, one can overcome stronger opponents by taking advantage of their own strengths and avoid their weaknesses.

Emei martial arts was formed to help the weak overcome the strong. /CGTN Photo Emei martial arts was formed to help the weak overcome the strong. /CGTN Photo

In addition to practicing, Wu devotes himself to the legacy of Emei martial arts and constantly explores new paths of development. In 1986, China initiated the Sanshou competition. Wu volunteered to form the Sichuan Sanshou Team. After the first round, however, his team was almost wiped out. ""That kind of intense movement was pretty much like anaerobic exercise. We were exhausted entering the second round,"" says Wu.

He found that endurance and stamina could be key points in the Sanshou competition. It occurred to him that there is a kung fu style in Sichuan called ""Xiaojindan"" that could help to regulate breathing for practitioners. ""Contract the abs during intense exercises, and press the extra air out of the body in an instant. Fresh air will flow into your gut. Whenever I feel tired, I'd practice this technique. Then I would not get tired easily,"" says Wu.

The method produced a marked effect. In the following year's National Sanshou Invitational Tournament, the Sichuan Sanshou Team won two championships. The team standing rose from almost 20th to the third place nationwide, which pushed Emei martial arts onto a larger platform.

Red Fist: An important role in traditional Chinese martial arts,"06:04

The song of the fist goes: The chivalry fist starts in an exceptional way, with cross punches to protect both sides. The upward punch is a crucial mainstay, while keeping the central position defended. Push the elbow into the chest, turn the palms as fast as wind. Like wielding the sword without rest¡­ One arm thrusts into the sea, with various tricks hidden in the sleeve.

These vigorous and powerful moves come from the Red Fist, one of the mainstream local fists in northwest China's Shaanxi Province.

Originating in the Zhou and Qin dynasties (770B.C.-207 B.C.), Red Fist is widespread in the Guanzhong area in Shaanxi. It plays an important role in traditional Chinese martial arts. Through the collection and arrangement by generations of inheritors, it has formed a system with rich content, various routines and comprehensive techniques. It is well-known for professional excellence and moral integrity.

Originating in the Zhou and Qin Dynasties, Red Fist is widely spread in the Guanzhong area of Shaanxi Province. /CGTN Photo Originating in the Zhou and Qin Dynasties, Red Fist is widely spread in the Guanzhong area of Shaanxi Province. /CGTN Photo

The ""red"" in the name implies that the fist is bloody and lethal, with blade-like moves inspired by the ancient battlefield. Later in the Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368), it developed into a barehanded martial art due to the ban of weapons. Nonetheless, the moves are still lethal. The Red Fist also has unique cultural characteristics, and is the essence of Shaanxi martial arts culture. As the chairman of the Shaanxi HongQuan (Red Fist) Culture Research Association, Shao Zhiyong has been committed to the promotion of Red Fist. In his view, the fist focuses on the balance between inner and outer strengths. It is for both good health and competition.

""I began to practice the Red Fist to be stronger in my childhood. I went on to do that for nearly six decades and it does help a lot,"" said Shao. During the practice, one should study skills and understand the cultural connotations. Before accepting a disciple, the master examines their moral character and behaviors to see if they are qualified. ""Learn the rituals before going to the master. Know the morals before practicing the fist. We practice not to bully, but for justice, confidence and self-improvement,"" said Shao.

With this unremitting spirit, he has been contributing to the revitalization of traditional martial arts and the promotion of national cultures."
Wing Chun: One of the traditional southern fists styles,"06:50

Created in the Southern Shaolin Temple in southeast China's Fujian Province, Wing Chun is one of the traditional southern fists styles. Legend has it that Wing Chun was created by female Master Wumei in the late Ming and early Qing dynasties. Her pupils then promoted it in Hong Kong and around the world.

When talking about Chinese martial arts, it is said that ""Shaolin is in the north and Wing Chun in the south."" Wing Chun is a technique used to stop attacks. It uses the principles of human mechanics, lever structure and triangle mechanics to attack the opponent's weakness. The goal is to defeat the strong as soon as possible. For many people, Wing Chun is based in the ¡°muk yan chong,¡± the wooden dummy, but the essence of this practice is far from that. As an eighth-generation Wing Chun inheritor, Zheng Zujie thinks that Wing Chun has a deep, profound meaning.

Zheng Zujie is an eighth-generation Wing Chun inheritor. /CGTN Photo Zheng Zujie is an eighth-generation Wing Chun inheritor. /CGTN Photo

Great wisdom in small ideas

Different from other fists with complicated branches, Wing Chun only has three sets of moves: ¡°siu nim tau¡± (little idea), ¡°cham kiu¡± (seeking arm) and ¡°biu tze¡± (shooting fingers). The ¡°siu nim tau¡± comes from Zen and is based on the philosophy of cleansing the thoughts and truly understand yourself. It is the basic technique of Wing Chun. Developing a strong character is more important during training. ""Once you calm down in peace, you can focus more on what you're doing,"" says Zheng.

Using a short punch to beat a strong enemy

Why does the Wing Chun win when it comes to speed? The secret is to punch forward right in front of you. And there is no accumulation of strength. But how can one exhibit great strength in the shortest distance? As an old saying goes: The power is generated by the muscles and unleashed with the bones. The answer is a power push. Wing Chun is a combination of short moves like punches, fingers, wrists, elbows, and torso. By gathering all the strength, the power in those moves is concentrated.

Protect the centerline as well as moral principles

Vital body parts such as the eyes, nose, throat, abdomen, and genitals are almost all on the centerline. Wing Chun moves are aimed at protecting these organs. Thus it is called ""Protecting the centerline."" In fact, there's a hidden meaning in this idea. As a practitioner of Wing Chun, one must defend the bottom line; they must remain faithful to the principles and morals of martial arts.

""Protecting the center line"" is the principle of Wing Chun. /CGTN Photo ""Protecting the center line"" is the principle of Wing Chun. /CGTN Photo

The old doctrine of Wing Chun requires the disciples to have a positive energy, promote harmony, and respect their teachers. At the same time, they shall assume responsibility and fight as best as they can. Just as the ancestors would say, ""Show mercy, otherwise your ferocity."" Since ancient times, Wing Chun has always been a technique for gentlemen.

Changhuxinyimen fist, one of the traditional Shaolin fists, has compact and powerful moves. First created by the great monk Huiyang from the Shaolin Temple in the Song Dynasty (960-1279), it was adapted by Kinnara, an eccentric monk famous for defending the temple during the Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368), and many martial arts masters in the Ming (1368-1644) and Qing dynasties (1636-1912). The fist has a rather complete routine that dates back over a thousand years.

The fist evolved from real combat. The techniques are powerful and vigorous, fast and consecutive, focusing on both attack and defense. While attacking, one must keep their body within a limited space, punch and spin the fist to release the maximum power. The movements are highly practical. After years of improvement, the practitioners pay more attention to inner practice, or Zen meditation.

Shi Yandian is a warrior monk in the Shaolin Temple. He's been practicing traditional martial arts since he was 8. He believes that Shaolin kung fu is the unity of the spirit and technique. And his ultimate goal is to reach high-level inner cultivation.

However, it's not easy to be single-minded. Even Shi Yandian, who has been practicing for many years, got into serious trouble. He was injured in an accident and became bedridden. After treatment, he was in a bad mental state and lost his courage. Fortunately, after constant self-adjustment, he gradually rediscovered his confidence. ""Sometimes you are defeated, not by the injuries, but by the vulnerability within,"" says Shi.

Inner cultivation is not only about the martial art. In daily life, it is more like a kind thought, or positive behavior. Once you achieve this level, you will have a good mentality. The best of Shaolin is in Zen, rather than its fists. And that is why the Shaolin martial art has been passed down for thousands of years. All thoughts are Zen. Through the elimination of bad emotions, one can achieve a happy, positive mentality. This process is also a form of self-cultivation."
Shaolin spear: Mastery of speed and accuracy,"Shaolin kungfu is well-known as one of the most prominent schools of Chinese martial arts. It has complete routines, flexible moves and complicated branches. In addition to basic fist and leg moves, it also features many weapons, such as blades, cudgels, hammers and swords.

Because of its unique culture, Shaolin Temple has become a sacred place for martial art enthusiasts. Shi Yanmeng is one of them. His obsession with martial arts began in his childhood. At the age of 15, he passed stringent tests to become one of the 34th-generation disciples of Shaolin Temple.

Shi Yanmeng has been improving his skills with the spear. The Shaolin spear requires swiftness and agility and has been passed on for more than a millennium. He's been practicing the spear, taking his time to learn selected moves in various styles. The techniques are very elaborate.

The most important thing in practicing the spear is the combination of strength, speed and accuracy. One's wrists must be strong. Some of the basic spear moves, like the ""block, grab and stab"" technique, require wrist control and strength.

The powerful and swift moves require explosive force and speed. Performing the technique required coordinated wrist and body movements, your waist strength drives the shoulders, then your elbows, then your wrists, and eventually, it goes through your hands. This brings the whole-body strength to the tip of the spear to maximize it.

Shi also practices archery with his fellow apprentices in his spare time to help improve his accuracy.

""Strength alone is not enough for the practice of Shaolin spear,"" he said. ""No matter how strong you are, it does not work without accuracy."""
Wonder boy in the field: Blind people can also play football,"04:32

China blind men's football team have finished fourth at the Tokyo Paralympic Games, matching their achievement in the Rio 2016 Paralympics. Although very young, the team established in 2006 has already scored some outstanding achievements. They won a silver medal at the 2008 Beijing Paralympics, a bronze medal at the 2010 World Championships and six Asian Championships. It can be said that they are the top in Asia and one of the best in the world. In this team, there is a dream chaser who is sunny and optimistic. His name is Liu Meng.

Liu Meng in football training. /CGTN Liu Meng in football training. /CGTN

In 1995, Liu was born in an ordinary family in southwest China's Shuitangpu Village, Yunnan Province. He was born with congenital keratitis. In elementary school, Liu couldn't even see the words on the blackboard. When he was 13 years old, Liu could not see anything any more. Liu was sent to the Kunming School for the Blind and Dumb by his parents. According to the plan, he should have been a masseur after graduation, like his other classmates. He had never imagined that his destiny would be linked to football. In school, Liu was very naughty and active. Once, he overheard the sound of mineral water bottles rolling on the ground. After that, he often played with his classmates by kicking plastic water bottles. This scene happened to be caught by Le Jiankun, the P.E. teacher of the school and the coach of Yunnan blind men's football team. Le told Liu that if he liked kicking, he would take him out of the school for a new thing. In this way, Liu came into contact with blind football for the first time. In 2009, Liu joined Yunnan blind men's football team, and his life has unlimited possibilities since then.

For the athletes with visual impairments, localization by sounds in the game of football 5-a-side is an essential skill. Except the goalkeepers, who have a normal vision, other players' vision is impaired. To be fair, players must wear blindfolds during the game. They distinguish the direction and location by the sound of a special football which has 6 built-in bells. They have to complete a series of actions such as running with the ball, passing to other teammates, and shooting in complete darkness. Teammates seek cooperation through screaming. The coach and goalkeeper are responsible for guiding the direction of the midfield and backfield. There is also a guider standing behind the opponent's goal to guide the offense. When moving, tackling or looking for a ball, the player must make ""voy, voy, voy"" or similar sounds to ensure safety.

""When they take every step, they must overcome the fear of unknown ahead."" The words from the leader of China blind men's football team tell us the difficulties and challenges in the blind football. They can't see the path of the ball and can't estimate the speed of the ball. They can only feel it through touching the ball by their feet. The collision and injuries in training are frequent. Liu Meng once wanted to give up his football career and be an ordinary masseur because of serious injury. ""I was very young when I first played football. I was afraid then. I got hurt seriously in a game. That made me wonder what I could do if my feet has some problems when I already cannot see anything. Things could not get worse."" However, at the thought of the joy that football brings to him and the time spent with his teammates, Liu returned to the field again.

The business secret of the 'rabbit raising brothers'Ø­1.4 Billion,"06:05

Wei Guikang was born in Shicun Village, Lingnan Town, Heshan City in southwest China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. He runs a rabbit raising cooperative with his younger brother, Wei Guiguo.

The project is not only the result of the two brothers' entrepreneurship but also a chance for many local families to get rid of poverty.

Heshan: From the city of light and heat to poverty-stricken

Heshan is located in southwest China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. /CGTN Heshan is located in southwest China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. /CGTN

Heshan used to be referred to as the city of light and heat. Coal deposits had contributed to its prosperity. ""In its heyday, tile-roofed houses were built everywhere. You could see myriad lights,"" Wei Guikang recalled. After years of mining, the raw minerals ended. The county-level of Heshan became a resource-exhausted city and, consequently, a poverty-stricken county.

Business opportunities

Wei graduated from college in 2012. After about half a year of research, he found that local meat rabbits were in short supply in Guangxi. So he decided to go back and start his own business with his younger brother. They set up a warren and divided the work.

Wei brothers rabbit farm./CGTN Wei brothers rabbit farm./CGTN

Wei Guikang does the sales, focusing on rabbit meat prices and marketing channels. Wei Guiguo manages the breeding part of the business, meaning that by six every morning he is already up and around the warren. ""Compared with raising chickens and ducks, rabbits are more difficult. More than 10,000 rabbits need to be health checked every day,"" Wei Guikang said.

Wei brothers' warren. /CGTN Wei brothers' warren. /CGTN

After several years, their cooperation and hard-work started bearing fruits, and the warren began to take shape and reap benefits.

Working together to get rid of poverty

In 2016, Heshan municipal government came to the brothers, hoping that they could work with poverty-stricken households to lift them out of poverty.

The rabbit cooperative. /CGTN The rabbit cooperative. /CGTN

However, few of those households knew about the cooperative. With a lack of funds and technology, they were reluctant to participate. ""Poverty-stricken households in other villages were not familiar with our cooperative. Wining their trust and having them join the cooperative was rather difficult,"" said Wei Guikang. Wei Guikang explained the business model and how both parts could work together. After joining the cooperative, members receive technical guidance on how to breed rabbits. He intends to show that this rabbit cooperative can truly help the poor households overcome their difficulties.

Wei visits a poor household. /CGTN Wei visits a poor household. /CGTN

The first problem was money, so the cooperative gives registered families rabbits to breed, free of charge. Second, technique. The cooperative provides free technical guidance on how to raise rabbits. The third question was sales. Who would buy the rabbits? The cooperative buys all the mature rabbits that the poor households raise. What's more, the cooperative sustains its own profits and losses regardless of the market price, eliminating the worries of the poor households.

Chejiawo Village is located on the edge of the Horqin Sandy Land in Horqin Left Wing Rear Banner, north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. Due to the lack of arable land, villagers hardly had any harvests, which led to slender incomes. The problem of poverty was evident.

""My wife got sick and my children had to go to school. We had nothing more to sell off in the house. We were broke,"" villager Chang Ying said, remembering those days in the past. Chang, 53, is a member of the Caogan group of Chejiawo Village. He couldn't afford his wife's medical expenses or his children's tuition fees, making the family one of the registered poverty-stricken households in the village.

China launched the targeted poverty alleviation policy in rural areas in 2014. In response to the national policy, Chejiawo established the Caogan Desert Scenic Area, aiming at developing the tourism industry.

The desert can be a gold mine

To include poor households in the industry, the national government pushed a special project, lending 50,000 yuan to each poor family. There were also measures implemented in the scenic spot to help improve people's lives.

After negotiation, poor households were allowed to use loans to purchase camels, horses and all the materials necessary to operate the spot. Village cadres started to encourage residents to make money in the scenic spot. Looking at the desert, Chang never thought it could attract tourists, so he only bought one horse to give it a try. Unexpectedly, the scenic spot quickly attracted a large number of tourists, and so his income improved.

I didn't even dare to imagine that we could move into a new house,"" Chang said.

"The Umbrella Bias in a ""Lost Village""Ø­1.4 Billion","07:03

With rapid and extensive urbanization, more and more people are moving to the cities, leaving their old houses unattended. The villages bearing people's childhood memories are fading away with time.

Chenjia Village may be one of the most insignificant among the ""lost villages."" Boasting stunning landscapes and a temperate climate, the place used to be a sanctuary for a simple life. As time changed, a declining economy made the residents move, leaving the place with a few people and many dilapidated houses.

To make matters worse, girls got reluctant to get married and settle down in this remote village. A high number of bachelors led to a decreasing birth rate over the years.

To salvage the village, the most important thing is to raise the locals' income. There are a lot of moso bamboos on the mountains. Many villagers use the bamboo to make umbrella ribs. In addition to implementing the national poverty alleviation policy, the cadres find ways to expand the sale of umbrella ribs, a step to improve villagers' lives.

'Blood brothers' in a poverty-stricken villageØ­1.4 Billion,"07:26

Jifeng, a small village of just over 1,000 people, was one of the most impoverished villages in central China's Hunan Province a decade ago. Located in Xiangxi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture, it had poor transportation, underdeveloped infrastructure and a sluggish economy. The lack of financial resources led to low income, leaving many households poverty-stricken.

This story, however is not just about the remote village, but about two men who became ""blood brothers"". In early 2008, Lei Qiming was selected as a member of the poverty alleviation team of the CPC Xiangxi Commission for Discipline Inspection. On his very first day in Jifeng Village, he heard about Xiang Deren.

Xiang's household was registered as poverty-stricken. He had a reputation for being lazy. Living alone in a dilapidated bungalow covered with weeds, he didn't work and spent most of his time drinking. As he had refused to work with the poverty alleviation team, there had been little progress. His case had become a hard nut to crack.

Soon however, Lei came to realize that the situations of poverty-stricken households were not always the same, and different methods should be used. No longer preaching at Xiang, he tried to communicate with him and helped him to regain confidence, so that he could shake off poverty on his own. Xiang's wife had left him years ago, taking their son and daughter with her. But she had remarried, and Xiang said he wanted his boy to come back and live with him.

For example, the medical expenses of Wang's son cost the savings of the poor family. But spiritual indolence and self-abandonment were also the internal causes of their poverty. 'It's a total loss of hope. I became demotivated. There's no meaning in making money anymore. No cure for my boy. I could only spend the rest of my life in pain,"" said Wang.

If you want to become rich, you must work hard. In 2016, with the government's help, he applied for the income generating project to grow watermelons and received 18,000 yuan. The government also provided Wang with a public welfare post. From cleaning, Wang earned 750 yuan per month, which relieved his stress.

Makelimu's WishØ­1.4 Billion,"08:20

Tuanjie Village was one of nine poor villages in Chahandusi Township, Haidong City, in northwest China's Qinghai Province.

Tuanjie Village /CGTN Tuanjie Village /CGTN

Tuanjie has an aging population who mostly make their living from the soil. For Makelimu, however, life here is especially hard as three of the four members of his family have disabilities. His wife has a speech disability, his son is hearing impaired, and he has a grade three physical disability. As a result, the family was one of the most poverty-stricken households in the village.

Makelimu (C) and his family /CGTN Makelimu (C) and his family /CGTN

Standing less than 1.5 meters tall, Makelimu, who is middle-aged, cannot do physical work for long hours. The spirit is willing, as they say, but the flesh is weak. I used to do odd jobs where I was underpaid, and that upset me. Normal people earned about 10 yuan a day. I got no more than five. It was far from enough, but I could do nothing about it.

Everything has changed since 2016, when Makelimu took up his first career ¨C raising cattle. With the support of the national targeted poverty alleviation policy, poverty-stricken families in Tuanjie Village got 21,600 yuan per person as seed money. Mahaibi, the village secretary, helped Makelimu build a 50-square-meter breeding shed that helped kick-start his cattle business.

With little prior knowledge, Makelimu struggled in the beginning. Therefore, Mahaibi introduced him to a fellow villager who had a professional breeding shed. ""It has a poor appetite. You can add some digestive powder and a little bit of salt in the fodder."" ""The white grass has low nutritional value. You need some silage.""

The secretary wrote down all the villager's advice and personally instructed Makelimu on what he should do. His career gradually got on track. Considering his family situation, the village cadres helped him increase the income in many ways. As many villagers go out to work, their farmland is left unattended, so Mahaibi encouraged them to contract Makelimu to take care of it.

""Makelimu. Here is your goal. You have four cattle now. In the future, you will have 40."" With the encouragement of the secretary, Makelimu has the drive to move forward. Now, Makelimu and his family have moved into their new home. Their former dilapidated and leaky house is history. Although the disabilities remain, everything is different as their living conditions are better. Even villagers said Makelimu looks like a totally different person. He hopes that more people like him are able to lift themselves out of poverty through their own efforts under the targeted poverty alleviation policy.

Father and son in a poverty-stricken village in E China,"07:18

One makes many choices in life ¨C some are easy and others difficult. Choosing life in a prosperous city over a poor mountainous village with harsh conditions seems to be an easy choice, but a Chinese man chose difficulty over convenience. But why? Guan Jianjun is head of Zhanqian Village, Gaojialing Town, east China's Jiangxi Province. He's known as a leader of poverty alleviation.

It is the third time Guan is serving at the grassroots. At the beginning of 2020, when schools were closed due to COVID-19, Guan brought his son with him to the village.

Today, as per usual, Guan gets up before dawn and plans three things to do for the day. After washing up, Guan and his son get on an e-scooter to begin their first task.

First stop: Hospital Task: Collecting and handing out reimbursement cards ""With a Class II certificate for chronic disease, you can get medicine from the town hospital, while Class I means access to the county hospital. This is the chronic disease certificate for poor households. With that, 90 percent of medical expenses at the town health center can be reimbursed,"" said Guan.

Before handing out the reimbursement cards, Guan learned everything about what they entail. Having worked for 15 years, he knows what the policy means for poverty alleviation. Illness and disability are major reasons of poverty. Before the medical policy was implemented, many people chose not to go to hospitals, which led to worsening conditions. Some eventually lost the ability to work, making it harder to shake off poverty.

While handing out the cards, Guan explains how to use them. The villagers look forward to meeting him because to them he is not just a leader, but more like a family member who genuinely cares for them. ""Especially the elderly who have few people around, they are happy to see us. We talk about good things in life, making them feel comfortable and remembered,"" said Guan.

Second stop: Duck farm Task: Helping a poor family sell ducks and eggs Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the poultry industry has been suffering a setback in sales. Guan takes farmers' ducks and eggs and goes around selling them on his motorcycle. He's determined to help the poor households. He knows what money means to them.

In one such household, a villager's wife got seriously ill a few years ago. Spending on her treatment wiped out almost all their savings. They didn't even have the money for food. The poverty alleviation cadres helped them borrow 50,000 yuan to raise ducks so that they can sustain a living. Guan has been helping this family with the sales. After many setbacks, he finally made a deal, and before long, a buyer contacted the household and bought a batch of ducks.

There are a lot of trivial matters that require the cadres to get involved. It may seem easy to buy the film, but the poor households can't go to distant markets on their tricycles. ""They are afraid of troubling us, so sometimes they tell us nothing. Most of the time, we have to visit and talk to them actively, before they speak out about their difficulties in life,"" said Guan.

Two generations of forest guardians,"04:24

He Min is a Chinese girl from the Lisu minority in Yunlong County, Yunnan Province. When she was 6 years old, she dreamt of becoming a forest ranger to keep her hometown's natural resources safe. In 2017, 23-year-old He Min's dream came true. She is proud to do such a job, as her father gave his life protecting natural resources. Yunlong County, located in the west of Yunnan Province, is the southernmost habitat for China's first-class protected animal, the Yunnan snub-nosed monkey. It is also home to China's first-class protected plant, Taxus Chinensis. The abundance of wildlife and wild plants attracts poachers. He Minghan, He Min's father, was a forest ranger in Yunlong Tianchi Natural Reserve, where all his family lived.

He Min, the daughter of He Minghan, is now a forest ranger. He Min, the daughter of He Minghan, is now a forest ranger.

He Minghan loved nature. He liked to walk in the forest with his daughter. She usually went first, and her father followed behind. He Min was very young then, and her tall father made her feel safe. They often saw wild animals as they passed through the forest. In order not to destroy vegetation, they would take a long way round. Sometimes, He Min naughtily plucked at plants, but her father would tell her to stop as all leaves are lives. He Minghan gave his daughter a white dog to keep her company. Every day, He Min and her dog sat on the steps to wait for her father to come home. But one day, he never came back.

Liu Liping was afraid to tell her daughter the truth. It wasn't until He Min was 6 years old that her grandmother told her that her father had passed away. Even though she felt sad, she was determined to follow in her father's footsteps and protect her hometown.

He is still very tall, he is still very kind. She feels that her father is saying to her, you are a good daughter, keep the forest safe, keep our homeland safe."

European and Chinese musicians came together in Paris to perform a perfect blend of Western and Eastern music, both traditional and modern, to mark this year's Mid-Autumn Festival, one of the biggest annual holidays in China. Hosted by the China Cultural Center in the French capital, the 2021 Mid-Autumn China-France Online Concert gathered 15 well-known artists on a festival-inspired stage decorated by floating lanterns designed to look like the full moon ¨C to which the holiday is dedicated.

On Sunday, Germans go to the polls to elect a new government that will then elect a new chancellor to replace the long-standing Angela Merkel.

She has been praised by some for her handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. Compared with other European Union nations, Germany has been applauded for doing relatively well throughout the past 18 months of the pandemic.

A fast response to the initial outbreak, with wide-scale testing, allowed Germany's health care system to manage the rising infection numbers.

And while the economy was hit hard, considerable social services to help those most affected were promised and delivered.



Anti-lockdown divides

However, once federal and state lockdown measures and restrictions on public life were introduced ¨C they were less severe, it should be noted, than other EU nations such as France and Spain ¨C some felt the government's hand was reaching too far into their private lives.

Anti-lockdown, anti-government demonstrations began to occur across the country with protesters blaming politicians for encroaching on their rights and freedoms.

The government has had to tread carefully, constantly reviewing measures that will keep Germans safe and beds in intensive care units open.

To jab or not to jab

Vaccinations are now the dividing issue in German society. With only 63 percent of the population fully vaccinated, Germany's President Frank-Walter Steinmeier blames this on a ""crisis of trust"" between the citizens and the state.

Some political parties, such as the pro-free market Free Democratic Party and the far-right populist Alternative for Germany, have been campaigning on this ""crisis of trust"" looking to garner more support from people opposed to vaccination.

Forcing people to get vaccinated is a sensitive topic in the country. While a majority agree to stricter rules for the unvaccinated, most don't want them mandated by the government.

""It's your own body,"" says 25-year-old student Nadiesta Kaminski. ""I think you should still leave it to the people because some want to get vaccinated later, as I actually do, just to see more studies, how it works.""

Munich mother Angelika Hofmann says everyone should have their own choice: ""The unvaccinated should have disadvantages, because they now had the opportunity to be vaccinated and the general public cannot always be disadvantaged with all these measures.""

German voter Philip Pappenheim believes in mandating vaccines, arguing that ""it is actually a positive thing because the people who are not vaccinated now are appropriately to blame. They don't do much to help the general public.""

The current ruling coalition government (CDU/CSU and the SPD) will not force inoculations, but are doing all they can to push more people to get the jab.

In August, the 3G rule was introduced across Germany. Now anyone wanting to access a restaurant or cultural space must show proof of a vaccine (geimpft in German), a negative test (getestet) or a recent recovery from COVID-19 (genesen).

The government has also announced it will stop paying for the currently free COVID-19 tests come October.

But what could a new government bring?

Both the chancellor candidates of the CDU, Armin Laschet, and the SPD's Olaf Schulz have said they will not mandate vaccines, however Annalena Bearbok of the Greens says her party will not rule that out.

Yet, with only days to go before Germans decide on the next leaders to take the country forward, the head of Germany's disease control agency, Lothar Wieler, warned that hospitals were filling up with young, unvaccinated people.

""The pandemic is not over yet,"" he cautioned. ""If the vaccination rate in the country doesn't increase drastically, Germany will experience a fulminant wave of new coronavirus infections in the fall.""

The direct impact the pandemic is having on the lives of Germans has fueled varying opinions that will likely play out in the ballot boxes."

Fears pandemic could delay plans to address child poverty in Europe,"08:40

There are fears that levels of child poverty in Europe could increase further as governments withdraw targeted financial support to families who have suffered during the COVID-19 pandemic. Before COVID-19, nearly 23 percent of all children in the European Union were at risk of poverty or social exclusion. Single-parent households were at the highest risk. It is widely believed the numbers have spiked dramatically during the pandemic as millions lost their jobs and families were hit with a fresh wave of financial hardship. Floods in northern Europe and fires across the south of the continent ¨C in Italy, Greece and Spain ¨C have also had a devastating effect, as families have lost their homes and livelihoods. This means that now nearly one in three children in Europe doesn't have access to adequate food, healthcare, early education, or decent housing.

Nearly a quarter of all children in Europe are at risk of poverty, a chronic issue experts fear could worsen due to the pandemic. Nearly a quarter of all children in Europe are at risk of poverty, a chronic issue experts fear could worsen due to the pandemic.

Food banks demand Across Europe, a record number of people turned to food banks during the pandemic. The Food Bank of Hainaut Occidental in Wallonia, Belgium had to collect three times as much food to meet the growing demand. ""We see the increase and what lies ahead of us is ominous,"" said Jacques Vandenschrik, president of the European Food Banks Federation. ""The increase in food demand for children, adults and seniors is going to be massive."" Vandenschrik fears a dramatic spike in hunger as the financial support governments doled out during the pandemic starts to dry up. ""Before the pandemic, we had this issue and while many people believe that Europe is a fantastic continent where everyone lives in a very decent way, well, it is not true,"" he said. ""There is no privileged country in Europe. Everywhere there is poverty and there is a need for feeding help.""

EU initiative 'not enough' To address the chronic problem of child poverty, the EU launched a new initiative earlier this year called the European Child Guarantee. It is aimed at lifting 5 million children out of poverty by 2023, by providing them with free access to healthcare, housing, and education. But critics say much more is needed if Europe is to really address the 18 million children living in poverty across the bloc. ""It's not ambitious enough, that is clear,"" said Jana Hainsworth, the secretary-general of the child welfare organization Eurochild. ""The money that's coming out of the European Union is just a drop in the ocean, but the political commitment is really important.""

Clothes and perfume give way to go-karts and bars in UK town centers,"02:43

Department stores used to be the cornerstone of many high streets in UK's towns, but changing shopping habits have seen the vast majority shut down and boarded up. Many lay empty months after closing their doors but a new trend has seen leisure experiences taking over some of that vacant retail space. In Wandsworth, in south west London, teenagers race around an electric go-karting track. Laid out over two floors, it snakes around what was once the cosmetics floor at the Wandsworth branch of the former high street giant Debenhams. An $8 million refit has transformed the space - all that is left of the original building is the escalators.

Michael Harrison, co-founder of Gravity Active Entertainment sits down with CGTN Europe in the bar that was formerly the Menswear department. ""I actually bought a pair of pants, just over there,"" he laughs. Harrison, who left school at 12 to help run his family's funfair business, says he's done everything in leisure, enabling him to oversee Gravity's expansion from one trampoline park in 2014 to one of the UK's biggest active entertainment companies. Gravity currently has 16 existing sites in the UK and plans for around 50 more within the next few years, across the UK, Germany, the rest of Europe and Saudi Arabia. Some of these will be with franchise partners. It's the relatively new availability of large empty retail space in town centers that has enabled the opening of Wandsworth, at over 7,400 square meters, heralding what Gravity says will be the first of many large sites. ""We've been preaching this multi-leisure, big-box concept for five years,"" he told CGTN Europe. ""The pandemic brought this to a head. All of a sudden we had the landlords coming to us, these were wounded animals. Department stores went out of fashion some time ago, so we're taking the opportunity to take advantage of the situation.""

China helps UN safeguard world peace with COVID-19 vaccine donation,"A consignment of China's Sinopharm COVID-19 vaccines arrived in Copenhagen on Monday as the Chinese government's donation for United Nations Peacekeeping personnel.

The donation handover ceremony was held virtually last Friday, and the vaccines are expected to be distributed to frontline personnel and close partners through the UN system as soon as possible.

The Chinese donation will be used in the African mission area on a priority basis, said Zhang Maoyu, deputy head of the China International Development Cooperation Agency, during the ceremony.

China's donation will enhance the UN's capacity to respond to the epidemic and help peacekeepers better fulfill their duties and missions, according to Christian Francis Saunders, the UN's assistant secretary-general for supply chain management.

Safeguarding world peace by helping others fight against COVID-19

The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has plagued the world with unprecedented challenges. Millions of lives have died, and many jobs have also been lost. Vaccination should always be the top priority in the fight against COVID-19. Over the past couple of months, China has committed to promoting a fair and reasonable distribution of COVID-19 vaccines around the world.

Since President Xi Jinping announced making China's COVID-19 vaccines a public good at the 73rd session of the World Health Assembly last May, the country has delivered about 800 million vaccine doses to more than 100 nations as of August. They are mostly developing countries, according to data from the Chinese Foreign Ministry.

Over 80 countries have received vaccine donations from China. Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said the total number of donated and exported doses ranked first in the world during the first meeting of the International Forum on COVID-19 Vaccine Cooperation last month.

Safeguarding world peace by providing financial support

China will also provide an additional $50 million in financial support to the UN COVID-19 Global Humanitarian Response Plan and establish a third-phase South-South Cooperation Trust Fund with the Food and Agriculture Organization totaling $50 million, Xi said at last year's General Debate of the 75th session of the UN General Assembly.

""China will continue to be a builder of world peace, a contributor to global development and a defender of the international order,"" the Chinese president said, calling for global solidarity and commitment to common values of humankind, such as peace, development, fairness, justice, democracy and freedom.

As the world's largest developing country, China pays 15 percent of the UN's peacekeeping budget and 12 percent of the UN's regular budget, making it the second-largest contributor of all member states.

Notes on a Pandemic: Science Rules,"16:44

Since the first case of COVID-19 was reported in the Chinese city of Wuhan late last year, the focus of the world's medical community has been on finding an effective treatment in the fastest possible time.

Leaders in pharmaceutical research, working at breakneck speed, have predicted that a vaccine prototype may be ready in September.

Half a year on, however, a more cautionary tone is emerging.

""This virus may never go away"" warned Michael Ryan, of the World Health Organization, in May.

""It may become just another endemic virus in our communities. HIV has not gone away¡­ and I am not comparing the two diseases, but I think it is important that we be realistic.""

The challenge

Producing a vaccine for COVID-19 is not the only issue facing the international pharmaceutical industry.

""It's a huge challenge to manufacture sufficient vaccines to be able to protect the world's population,"" Jonathan Ball, professor of molecular virology at the University of Nottingham, told CGTN Europe.

""It's also a challenge for logistics in how fast and how rapidly can you develop and manufacture the vaccines as well as distribute them.""

Pressure

Despite calls for collaboration in the hunt for an effective and affordable treatment, problems are emerging.

The race for a vaccine has left the pharmaceutical sector under pressure as never before, from both public and private health providers and from politicians, who are moving fast to secure supplies for their own populations.

""I think what we see is that ... everybody wants to see that their own citizens are protected,"" Thomas Cueni, the director general of the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers in Geneva, told CGTN Europe.

""But ¡­ the reason I am optimistic is the European Commission was leading the global solidarity call, together with philanthropic organizations ¡­ and therefore notwithstanding that we do have a strong signal of nationalism, we at the same time have the combination with this call for solidarity.""

French monks burn down 5G masts,"Two Catholic monks in southeastern France have been charged with setting fire to 5G mobile network masts to draw attention to what they claim are the technology's health risks, prosecutors said.

Confessing to police, the monks from an ultra-conservative Capuchin monastery in the Rhone region, said they set out at night last week to burn down the first of two masts they planned to destroy.

The following night, the two men, aged 39 and 40, ventured out for the second mast in a neighboring village.

This time police were waiting and took them into custody.

The actual damage done to either mast was negligible, prosecutors told AFP, but the monks were charged with ""damage and attempted damage with an incendiary device.""

The men told an investigating magistrate they had wanted ""to warn the population against the harmful effects of 5G,"" Villefranche city prosecutor Laetitia Francart told AFP.

Telecoms operators, promising ultra-fast mobile technology, have faced fierce local protests in parts of France against 5G antennae amid claims they are a health hazard.

The monastery seemed to back the two monks' assessment, if not their acts of zealotry.

A spokeswoman said the arson was ""an isolated act and an error of youth.""

The World Health Organization says, in response to the question of 5G health risks: ""To date, and after much research performed, no adverse health effect has been causally linked with exposure to wireless technologies."""
Summer wildfires 'pushed CO2 emissions to record levels',"A wildfire burns in the Trail of 100 Giants grove in Sequoia National Forest, California. /Noah Berger/AFP A wildfire burns in the Trail of 100 Giants grove in Sequoia National Forest, California. /Noah Berger/AFP

Wildfires across the globe, including in Siberia, North America and around the Mediterranean have caused record levels of Carbon Dioxide (CO2) emissions this summer, says the EU's Earth monitoring service. Forests on fire emitted more than 2.5 billion tonnes of CO2, which is equivalent to India's annual emissions from all sources in July and August alone, according to the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service. More than half of CO2 emissions from wildfires came from North America and Siberia.

Heatwaves, drought conditions and reduced soil moisture amplified by global warming contributed to unprecedented fires in three continents. The Arctic Circle, which was also on fire, released some 66 million tonnes of CO2 from June through August, nearly a billion tonnes of which came from Russia. ""What stood out as unusual were the number of fires, the size of the area in which they were burning, their intensity, and also their persistence,"" Mark Parrington, senior scientist and wildfire expert at Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service told AFP.

Why were there so many wildfires during the summer? Fires started raging across northeastern Siberia in June and only started to abate in late August and early September, according to satellite-based monitoring from the service. Emissions from the region during that period were nearly double those of the year before. Even though satellite images do not provide answers to how these fires start, many of the blazes are thought to have been caused by ""zombie"" fires that smoulder through the winter and then reignite. Rising temperatures and increased dryness as a result of changing rainfall patterns create ideal conditions for bush and forest fires.

The World Meteorological Organization has reported that the five-year period to 2020 was ""unprecedented"" for fires, particularly in Europe and North America. In a draft report obtained by AFP, the United Nations' IPCC climate science advisory panel concluded: ""Globally, increases in temperature and aridity have increased the length of fire seasons and doubled potential burnable area.""

Wildfires have ravaged across most areas of the globe in 2021. The western U.S. and Canada's British Columbia posted record temperatures nearing 50 degrees Celsius and massive plumes of smoke from Siberia and North America reached across the Atlantic to parts of Britain and Europe. Persistent heatwaves along the Mediterranean rim worsened uncontrolled wildfires. Turkey's daily fire intensity reached the highest levels ever recorded in a near 20-year dataset and other countries hit by out-of-control blazes included Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Albania, North Macedonia, Algeria and Tunisia.

Poland says it will fight EU fines and continue work at Turow mine,"Poland's Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki says operations will continue at its controversial Turow mine, despite a ruling by the European Union's top court imposing daily fines.

The European Court of Justice ruled Monday that operations must halt at the mine and Poland must pay a daily penalty of more than $585,000 for breaching an earlier ruling.

The Turow mine, which borders Germany and Czechia, has been the subject of a long-running complaint from the Czech government after it recently began expanding further toward the border.

Czechia claims plans to extend the mine threaten the environment and groundwater on its land.

In May, the European Court of Justice ordered mining be immediately halted as an interim measure until a final judgment could be made. Czechia then asked the court to impose a daily penalty of more than $5 million on Poland for not immediately closing the mine.

Walking a tightrope above Paris

Czech authorities welcomed Monday's verdict despite the lower penalty.

Morawiecki stood firm Tuesday against the ruling from the EU's top court, telling a press conference: ""This decision is totally wrong ... we do not plan to stop operations of the Turow mine and energy power plant.""

He noted Poland would use ""all legal and any other possibilities"" to fight the decision.

The Polish government argues the Turow mine and nearby power plant are crucial for the country's energy security, supplying as much as 7 percent of Poland's energy output.

The mine, which produces lignite, or ""brown coal,"" has been running for more than a century. It and the nearby power station are part of the PGE Polish Energy Group. In 2020, the company's extraction license was extended at the mine until 2026, it's considered a major source of jobs for the region.

In response to Poland's refusal to comply, a spokesperson for the European Commission said Poland must pay the daily penalties and has a legal obligation to do so.

Another spokesperson said the European Commission wanted Poland to immediately halt operations at Turow and that the EU would use all its powers to ensure the fines imposed by the court were paid.

It was thought a financial penalty might pressure Warsaw to seek a resolution with Prague after bilateral talks began in June around mine upgrades and measures to limit damage to water levels, noise and air conditions.

However, the Polish government has pushed back ever since the ruling, saying the court's penalty undermines the talks.

Monday's order from the European Court of Justice adds to the other issues over which Warsaw is fighting the EU, the majority around rule of law."

Germany has reacted with shock and outrage after a 20-year-old petrol station worker was shot dead by a customer angry about being asked to put on a mask while buying beer.

The killing on Saturday evening in the western town of Idar-Oberstein is believed to be the first in Germany linked to the government's coronavirus rules.

The row started when the cashier, a student, told the customer to put on a face mask, as required in all German shops. After a brief argument, the man left.

The suspect then returned about an hour-and-a-half later, this time wearing a mask. But as he brought his six-pack of beer to the till, he took off the mask and another discussion ensued.

""The perpetrator then pulled out a revolver and shot him straight in the head,"" prosecutor Kai Fuhrmann told reporters on Monday.

The suspect, a 49-year-old German man, walked to a police station the following day to turn himself in. He was arrested and has confessed to the murder.

He told police he felt ""cornered"" by the coronavirus measures, which he perceived as an ""ever-growing infringement on his rights"" and he had seen ""no other way out,"" Fuhrmann said.

Idar-Oberstein mayor Frank Fruehauf called it ""an unfathomable, terrible act,"" and residents have laid flowers and candles outside the petrol station.

'The cruel result of hatred'

The murder comes just days before Germans head to the polls for a general election on September 26 that will see Chancellor Angela Merkel bow out after 16 years.

Katrin Goering-Eckardt, the parliamentary leader of the Green party, tweeted that she was ""deeply shaken"" by the killing, which she said was ""the cruel result of hatred.""

Agriculture Minister Julia Kloeckner from Merkel's center-right CDU party, who comes from the region, said the murder was ""shocking.""

The Tagesspiegel newspaper said far-right chat groups on the Telegram social platform were applauding the murder.

Germany has had repeated protests from anti-mask demonstrators throughout the pandemic, some of them attracting tens of thousands of people."

Afghans seeking to escape the Taliban and relocate to the UK have had their details accidentally revealed by the British government.

Earlier this month, the UK, the U.S. and other NATO members scrambled to evacuate their citizens and those who had worked for them after the Taliban gained control of Afghanistan.

UK Defense Secretary Ben Wallace said an email from Britain's Afghan Relocations Assistance Policy ¨C the scheme used to help interpreters and others who had worked for Britain ¨C had compromised more than 250 recipients by including all recipients' email addresses on them, rather than blind-copying the email addresses so recipients could not see who else had been sent the note.

Salisbury poisoning: UK charges a third Russian man for nerve attack,"British police say a third Russian has been charged in absentia with the 2018 Novichok murder attempt on former double agent Sergei Skripal, claiming that the three suspects were military intelligence operatives.

The attack on Skripal, who sold Russian secrets to the UK, caused the most significant row between Moscow and the West since the Cold War, leading to the tit-for-tat expulsion of dozens of diplomats after London pointed the finger of blame at the Kremlin.

Russia has consistently rejected any involvement in the matter, casting the accusations as anti-Russia propaganda.

Skripal and his daughter Yulia were found unconscious on a public bench in the southern English city of Salisbury in March 2018. Along with police officer Nick Bailey, who went to Skripal's house to investigate, they were left seriously ill in hospital from exposure to the military-grade nerve agent.

The three eventually recovered but Salisbury resident Dawn Sturgess died from Novichok poisoning after her partner found a discarded counterfeit perfume bottle, which police believe had contained the poison.

In September 2018, British prosecutors charged two Russians, then identified by the aliases Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov, with conspiracy to murder Skripal and the attempted murder of Yulia and Bailey.

Dean Haydon, the UK's senior national coordinator for counter-terrorism policing, said prosecutors had now authorized them to charge a third man, Sergey Fedotov, who he said is aged about 50, with the same offenses.

Haydon also said Petrov and Boshirov were actually named Alexander Mishkin and Anatoliy Chepiga and that Fedotov's true identity was Denis Sergeev.

Skripal plot

""We can't go into the detail of how, but we have the evidence that links them to the GRU [the Russian federal intelligence agency],"" Haydon told reporters, describing them as highly trained. ""All three of them are dangerous individuals.""

As with the other two Russians, British police had obtained an arrest warrant for Fedotov and they were applying for Interpol notices against him, he said.

All three men are believed to be in Russia, with which Britain has no extradition treaty, and the Russian authorities have so far offered no cooperation, Haydon added.

Litvinenko case

The police announcement comes on the same day the European Court of Human Rights ruled Russia was responsible for the 2006 killing of former KGB officer Alexander Litvinenko, who was poisoned at a London hotel with Polonium 210 ¨C a rare radioactive isotope.

Andrei Lugovoy, one of the men Britain accused of murdering Litvinenko, told Reuters on Tuesday that the ruling was politically motivated.

""I think this decision is absolutely politically motivated,"" Lugovoy told Reuters in an audio message shared by his assistant. ""I am very skeptical about it. I think it is extremely idiotic and damaging to the reputation of the European Court of Human Rights.""

Kremlin critic Litvinenko, 43, died weeks after drinking green tea laced with Polonium-210 at London's Millennium hotel in an attack Britain has long blamed on Moscow."
AUKUS a 'wake-up call' for Europe to strengthen sovereignty,"04:17

The new alliance between the U.S., Australia and the UK, which stripped France of a $40 billion contract for submarines with Canberra, angered Paris and now the European Union is rallying behind its member state. At an EU meeting in Brussels on Tuesday, ambassadors agreed to postpone preparations for an inaugural trade and technology council on September 29 with the U.S. in Pittsburgh. ""One of our member states has been treated in a way that is not acceptable, so we need to know what happened and why,"" said European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. The topic was taken off the meeting's agenda, two EU diplomats told Reuters.

French and German ministers in Brussels have talked about the Australia-UK-US deal, known as AUKUS, as a ""wake-up call"" for Europe to become a stronger independent actor on the global stage. ""It is once again a wake-up call for all of us in the European Union to ask ourselves how we can strengthen our sovereignty, how we can present a united front even on issues relevant to foreign and security policy,"" said Michael Roth, Germany's minister for European affairs. He also talked of the importance for the EU to talk ""with one voice"" and for the need to work together to rebuild what he called ""lost trust"" with its allies. Roth's counterpart in France, European affairs minister Clement Beaune, said he would ensure that the matter is discussed at EU summits and ministerial meetings next month.

France has welcomed the support of EU top officials and ministers, with Beaune saying the row is ""a European issue,"" rather than a French one. ""I don't think France is overreacting,"" he said on Monday, after France had recalled its ambassadors to the U.S. and Australia and French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian accused the U.S. of betrayal and Australia of back-stabbing.

Some EU member states have shown more caution, with Sweden's EU Minister Hans Dahlgren saying: ""I don't think we should restructure the EU's trade policy because of this."" European Council chief Charles Michel told reporters last week, when the deal was revealed, that they observed ""a clear lack of transparency and loyalty"" and that there needed to be ""transparency and trust"" between allies. The EU's top diplomat Josep Borrell said EU foreign ministers meeting in New York ""expressed clear solidarity with France."" The European Commission said on Monday it was looking into delaying negotiations with Australia on Canberra's three-year bid to secure an EU trade deal.

Meanwhile, the U.S. president has requested a meeting with his French counterpart to discuss the crisis. Joe Biden is said to be urgently trying to schedule a call with Emmanuel Macron. President Macron will not be attending the UN General Assembly (UNGA) in person this year and so any such meeting will have to be on the phone or by video. As of Tuesday afternoon, no call had been agreed, although Macron did find time to speak to his Indian counterpart, Narendra Modi, about Indo-Pacific strategy. Macron also has meetings with the Georgian president and the Lebanese prime minister scheduled this week, along with the inauguration of a modern art collection in Paris.



Speaking after a meeting of EU foreign ministers on the sidelines of the UNGA in New York, the France's Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said: ""We thought unilateralism, unpredictability, brutality and not respecting your partner was part of the past but it continues.""



""It's not just about a brutal, unexpected and unexplained breach of a contract,"" said Le Drian. ""What matters now is the breach of trust between partners, because partners in alliance means transparency and predictability. It requires explanations."" The AUKUS pact will supply Australia with at least eight nuclear-powered submarines by 2040. Canberra pulled out of its original contract with France for a dozen attack-class submarines in a deal worth at least $66bn and for which work was already under way. Linked to the announcement was the unveiling by the Australian prime minister, the U.S. president and the British prime minister of a new security arrangement between the three countries, focused on security in the Indo-Pacific region.

UK gas crisis: Will the government let energy companies collapse?,"Like any country in the modern world, the UK cannot function without access to energy. That makes the companies that provide it to individuals and businesses absolutely critical. At the start of 2021, there were more than 50 of them nationally. The British government is this week being warned that by the end of the year, there may be fewer than 10 left standing.

A surge in global gas prices in recent months means smaller providers will struggle to suck up the extra costs of buying wholesale in a market where the UK regulator, OfGem, enforces a cap on consumer prices. In other words, that extra expense cannot be fully offset by passing it on to consumers.

A plan may be emerging during crisis talks between the government, regulators and energy companies that could see many of them collapse as a result. However Britain's government has made clear it will not bail out failing energy companies.

Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng told lawmakers in parliament: ""The government will not be bailing out failed companies, there will be no rewards for failure or mismanagement, the taxpayer should not be expected to prop up companies that have poor business models.""

To prevent company failures causing the lights to go out up and down the country, the Financial Times is reporting that emergency loans would be offered to larger energy companies that survive, to persuade them to take on otherwise unprofitable customers from those failing providers. Without the promise of state support, where would the incentive be for them to do so?

That is one part of the equation aimed at averting a serious economic crisis.

The other is a shortage of carbon dioxide essential for the production and distribution of, among other things, food, drink and steel. CO2 is sold by major fertilizer producers, which also rely heavily on natural gas in their production processes.

Some have halted operations in the UK on account of high gas prices, meaning both fertilizer and CO2 stocks are running low. The solution may again be more government spending ¨C this time in the form of emergency subsidies, to persuade fertilizer manufacturers to restart production.

It is the kind of extra expenditure the state could do without, having already spent unprecedented sums to support businesses and individuals during the pandemic.

Getting the economy to stand on its own two feet again has become perhaps the main priority for policymakers in recent months, with the end of most domestic coronavirus restrictions in July and more recently an easing of rules for international travel. A major government support scheme for businesses is due to wind down at the end of September.

The hope appears to be that the current shortage will be short-lived and therefore not too taxing on the public purse in the long term. Arriving in New York for a meeting of the United Nations General Assembly, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said immediate action was needed to prevent businesses going bust. ""But this will get better as the market starts to sort itself out as the world economy gets back on its feet,"" Johnson added.

For now, consumers have been spared. The government and companies will absorb the costs. The longer this drags on, the more the pressure will build to pass on some of these higher prices in the form of higher gas bills."

It's not clear exactly why the population is getting shorter. /People's Vision

People living in the Netherlands, who measure up as the tallest in the world, are shorter than previous generations, a study has shown.

After the population gained height for decades as living standards and diet improved, researchers found that men born in 2001, at 182.9cm, were a centimetre shorter, on average, than those born in 1980. Women were 1.4cm shorter, at 169.3cm.

The study, conducted in coordination with several public bodies, was based on more than 700,000 individuals who self-reported their height aged 19.

While immigration was cited as one reason for the drop, with families of those moving from abroad generally shorter than Dutch natives, those with no history of immigration were also shorter than their peers were 20 years earlier. Changing diets are considered to be a possible factor.

The Dutch nevertheless remain the tallest people in the world."

On Tuesday, China celebrates the Mid-Autumn Festival. The celebration marks the harvest and is the second most important in China after the new year.

For many it is an opportunity to eat mooncake pastries and reunite with family.

The festival is held on the 15th day of the eighth month of the Chinese lunisolar calendar, corresponding to mid-September to early October of the Gregorian calendar.

Here are five things you might not know about the celebration:

It's 3,000 years old

The Chinese have celebrated the harvest during the autumn full moon since the Shang dynasty, which was founded in 1600 BCE and lasted for 600 years.

The festival started to gain wider popularity during the Tang dynasty (618¨C907 CE). And, by the time of the Northern Song Dynasty (960-1279 CE), it had become a popular folk festival and the 15th day of the eighth month of the lunar calendar was officially designated as the Mid Autumn Festival.

By the Ming and the proceeding Qing Dynasties, the Mid-Autumn Festival had become one of the main folk festivals in China.

People call it the Moon Festival

The ancient Chinese found the moon is at its fullest in the middle of every lunar month and at its brightest in the middle of autumn. This led to the festival being attached to the full moon.

In ancient China, offerings and sacrifices to the moon were an important social ritual both for emperors and the people. According to researchers, by the time of the Tang Dynasty, sacrifices were replaced by larger entertainment events.

The full moon, in part due to its associations with the festival, embodies feelings of harmony and reunion for many Chinese people."

Poland has vowed to keep its disputed Turow coal mine running, despite being hit with a order to pay a 500,000 euro ($585,550) daily penalty to the European Commission for defying an earlier court ruling to halt operations.

Europe's top court, the Luxembourg-based Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU), ordered the penalty on Monday.

It followed a request from Czechia, which is locked in a dispute with Poland over the Turow open-pit mine that sits next to their shared border. The Czech government says the mine is damaging its communities.

The mine, which produces lignite, or brown coal, has been operating for more than a century, but has recently expanded further towards the Czech border.

The EU penalty could pressure Warsaw to seek a resolution with Prague after bilateral talks started in June over technical upgrades and measures to limit damage to water levels and noise and air conditions. A deal should end any legal disputes.

The Polish government said on Monday the EU court's penalty undermined those talks and said Turow, a major source of jobs and electricity in its region, would continue operations.

""The fine mentioned by the Court of Justice of the European Union is disproportionate to the situation and is not justified by facts,"" Poland's government said in a statement.

""It undermines the ongoing process of reaching an amicable settlement.""

The court's order comes amid other disputes Warsaw faces with the European Union, largely over the rule of law.

Czechia has taken its grievance over Turow to the European Commission, which last year started legal proceedings, saying Warsaw had breached EU law when extending the mine's life.

The country also took its case to the CJEU, and won judges' backing for a temporary order to stop Turow's operations until a final judgment.

'Judicial robbery'

When Warsaw said it would not halt production, Prague asked for a daily penalty payment of 5 million euros ($5.9m) to be levied.

The court on Monday agreed but set the fine much lower.

""Such a measure appears necessary in order to strengthen the effectiveness of the interim measures decided upon in the order of May 21, 2021 and to deter that member state from delaying bringing its conduct into line with that order,"" judges said.

Prague welcomed the penalty but said it still wanted to reach an agreement in an amicable way.

Some Polish officials strongly rejected the order.

""The CJEU demands half a million [euros in] daily fines from Poland for the fact that Poland did not leave its citizens without energy and did not close the mines overnight,"" deputy justice minister Marcin Romanowski said on Twitter.

""It is judicial robbery and theft in broad daylight. You won't get a cent."""

Two new London Underground train stations opened their gates on Monday morning, marking the first major extension to the Tube network this century.

The $1.5bn Northern line extension, which began in 2015 and involved building a 3km tunnel from nearby Kennington, adds Nine Elms and Battersea Power Station to the iconic subterranean transport map in south London.

The extension ¨C completed ahead of schedule and under budget ¨C will help support around 25,000 new jobs and more than 20,000 new homes, with Battersea now a 15-minute direct ride from the City and West End. Trains will run every 10-12 minutes, doubling in frequency next year. Eight million people could eventually use the line.

""This extension will hugely improve the links between these vibrant, growing south London neighborhoods and the rest of the capital, and will also help to support thousands of new jobs and homes as we move forward with London's recovery from the pandemic,"" said Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London.

By 5 a.m., a crowd of more than 100 train enthusiasts had gathered outside Battersea Power Station station ¨C which is the only Tube stop to feature the word ""station"" twice ¨C to become the first passengers on the newly opened extension. Some had traveled from northern England the previous evening to ensure they made a slice of history."

Three people have died after crossing into Poland from Belarus, and a fourth person has been found dead on the Belarusian side of the border following a surge in illegal migration that has caused a diplomatic row. Polish officials, who announced the three fatalities inside Poland, gave no cause of death on Monday. The Belarusian border service identified the person found inside Belarus as ""a woman of non-Slavic appearance"" but did not say how she died. Poland's Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said there had been almost 4,000 attempts to illegally cross Poland's border in September and nearly 7,000 over the past two months and put the blame for the increase in migration on Minsk. ""[Belarus] has introduced a visa-free regime with several countries with great potential for illegal immigration, tens of thousands of people are being brought to Belarus,"" he said.

The European Union has also accused Belarus of encouraging people to cross into Polish territory, many of them from countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan, to put pressure on the bloc over sanctions it has imposed on Minsk. Poland has started building a barbed-wire fence to curb the flow of migrants and has declared a 30-day state of emergency in a 3km-wide strip of land along the frontier. ""There were three people who died unfortunately on the Polish side, as far as we know on the Belarusian side it was one woman,"" Polish border guard chief Tomasz Praga said.

Although he did not say how they died, he said there had been many cases of people being exhausted or suffering from hypothermia after arriving from Belarus and some had been saved from drowning in swamps. The Belarusian border service said ""clear signs of dragging a body from Poland to the Republic of Belarus were recorded"" near the corpse found on the Belarusian side of the frontier. ""This is a lie,"" Praga said. The Belarusian interior ministry declined to comment to Reuters. The Belarusian border service was not immediately available to comment. Praga said 110 people had been detained for allegedly helping organize illegal crossings. A pregnant woman had been detained after crossing the border with 13 children, none of them her own, and the children were admitted to hospital with COVID-19, he said. Interior Minister Mariusz Kaminski said 500 more soldiers would be deployed to help the border guard protect the frontier.

"Homes destroyed, thousands evacuated as Canary Islands volcano erupts","The Canary Islands' first volcanic eruption in 50 years has forced the evacuation of more than 5,000 people, including 500 tourists, and destroyed about 100 houses, officials said on Monday.

The volcano erupted on Sunday, shooting lava hundreds of meters into the air, engulfing houses and forests and sending molten rock towards the Atlantic Ocean over a sparsely populated area of La Palma, the most northwestern island in the Canaries archipelago.

No fatalities have been reported but the volcano was still active on Monday. Pictures showed heavy smoke coming from the volcano and houses burning.

Officials said they were hopeful they would not need to evacuate any more people.

""The lava is moving towards the coast and the damage will be material. According to experts, there are about 17 million to 20 million cubic meters of lava,"" regional president Angel Victor Torres told Cadena Ser radio.

The lava flow has destroyed about 100 houses so far, Mariano Hernandez, president of La Palma's council, told Cadena Ser.

About 20 houses were engulfed in the village of El Paso along with sections of roads, Mayor Sergio Rodriguez told state broadcaster TVE. The lava was spreading through neighboring villages, putting hundreds more at risk, he said.

Tourists evacuated

A group of 360 tourists was evacuated by boat to Tenerife from the beach resort of Puerto Naos, ferry operator Fred Olsen said, and more could be transferred later in the day.

Despite the destruction, Tourism Minister Reyes Maroto told Canal Sur radio the eruption should be seen as an opportunity to entice visitors to the island.

""The island is open, if your hotel is affected we will find you another one,"" she said. ""Make the most of this opportunity to enjoy what nature has brought us.""

Volcanologist Nemesio Perez said it was unlikely there would be any fatalities, as long as no one behaved recklessly."

Russia's ruling United Russia party, which supports President Vladimir Putin, won an emphatic parliamentary majority after its most vociferous critics were prevented from contesting an election that opponents said was marred by large-scale fraud.

With 98 percent of ballots counted on Monday, the Central Election Commission said United Russia had won nearly 50 percent of the vote, with its nearest rival, the Communist Party, at just under 20 percent.

United Russia won 54 percent in 2016, the last time a vote was held.

The scale of the victory means United Russia will have more than two-thirds of deputies in the 450-seat State Duma lower house of parliament. This will enable it to continue to push through laws without having to rely on other parties.

The Kremlin hailed the result, saying United Russia, which Putin helped found, had confirmed its role as the leading party. It said the election had been competitive, open and honest.

""The Communists have improved their results and there are new parties that have done well,"" said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, who praised the way the election had been conducted.

Kremlin critics alleged large-scale vote rigging. They said the election was a sham and that a newly introduced electronic voting system had been used to deprive opponents of United Russia of victory in Moscow.

Some Moscow-based Communists who felt cheated called for a protest in the Russian capital on Monday evening. The central square they named as the venue was sealed off by police on Monday afternoon.

""With such a colossal number of violations, the results of the State Duma elections cannot be recognized as clean, honest or legitimate,"" said Lyubov Sobol, an ally of jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny whose movement was declared extremist in June by a court.

Electoral authorities said they had voided any results at voting stations where there had been obvious irregularities and that the overall contest had been fair.

Sobol had hoped to run for parliament herself but Navalny's allies were barred from taking part after the extremism designation. Critical media and non-governmental organizations were also targeted by the authorities in the run up to the election.

Navalny's allies had organized a tactical voting campaign designed to drain support from United Russia, the popularity of which has fallen amid a malaise over faltering living standards and Navalny's allegations of corruption.

Authorities had tried to block the so-called ""smart voting initiative"" online."

? COVID-19 vaccines are being rolled out to 3 million eligible children aged between 12 and 15 in the UK. The program is to be delivered mainly in schools, with some institutions in England offering jabs from Monday. Scotland and Wales will follow this week, while Northern Ireland will offer the program from October.

? Millions of over-50s and vulnerable people across the UK will also be contacted from today to arrange their booster shots. Those eligible also include younger adults with underlying health conditions, plus front-line health and social workers.

? Former UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown has urged world leaders to avoid a ""vaccine waste disaster"" after a report from research group Airfinity suggested more than 100 million doses are due to expire. Brown said the failure of current UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, U.S. President Joe Biden and EU leaders to agree on a distribution plan meant the globe's poorest countries would miss out the most.

? Tony Holohan, Ireland's chief medical officer has praised the country's ""exceptionally"" high level of vaccine uptake. More than 90 percent of the Irish population aged over 16 are now fully vaccinated. Holohan said the figure was almost ""unprecedented"" and ""is the envy of our neighbors across the European Union and, indeed, across the world.""

? Remote working should become ""a permanent fixture of Irish working life,"" Leo Varadkar, Ireland's Deputy prime minister, has said, as much of the country returns to the office following an easing of COVID-19 restrictions. From Monday, up to 100 people will be able to gather indoors if they have recovered from the virus or have been fully vaccinated, while indoor activities such as fitness classes can now go ahead. All restrictions on outdoor group activities have also be removed.

? Sweden's minority government has promised an $8.6 billion boost for the economy in its 2022 budget, as it hopes to woo voters and overturn a deficit in opinion polls ahead of next year's general election. With many of the coalition's pandemic support measures being phased out, the budget is focused on a longer-term growth path, with extra money for welfare, fighting climate change and boosting jobs.

? Researchers are collecting samples from bats in northern Cambodia in a bid to understand more about the pandemic, returning to a region where a very similar virus was found in the animals a decade ago. Two samples from horseshoe bats were collected in 2010 in Stung Treng province near Laos and kept in freezers at the Institut Pasteur du Cambodge (IPC) in Phnom Penh. Tests performed on them last year revealed a close relative to COVID-19.

? A Hungarian biochemist who labored for years in obscurity has won the $1.5m Breakthrough Prize in life sciences. Few paid much attention to Katalin Kariko's work in the U.S., but when the pandemic struck, her decades of research into the potential of the genetic material mRNA became pivotal to the development of the Pfizer jab.

? Italy has reported 26 coronavirus-related deaths in the past 24 hours, down from 51 the day before, according to the country's health ministry. Daily infections fell to 3,838 from 4,578. There are currently 3,929 patients in Italian hospitals with the virus.

? Vaccine bookings in Italy surged last week after the government said all employees must show proof of a jab, negative test or recent recovery from COVID-19. Reservations for the first dose of the vaccine were up 35 percent over the weekend, compared with figures from the same time a week earlier. Close to 76 percent of the country's population has now been fully vaccinated."
Mid-autumn festival: Crowds return to central London,"There were still several hours to go until Jamie and his fellow Lion Dancers were due on stage. But early in the day, they were already present in Soho's Newport Place to lend a hand.

This is the heart of London's Chinatown. And on Sunday the area marked one of the most important celebrations in the Chinese calendar ¨C the mid-autumn festival, otherwise called the Moon Festival. Members of the Chinese community across the generations rushed around excitedly ahead of the first such event here since 2019.

The 2020 festivities were canceled due to the pandemic. Jamie hoped this year might match the event as he remembered it, from performing before coronavirus spread around the globe. ""It's fun and energetic,"" he said.

That was the hope, but it wasn't guaranteed. The weather forecast was dire. And though most coronavirus restrictions have now been removed across the UK, there is still some lingering nervousness. As the community mucked in to raise banners and hang Chinese lanterns ahead of the 1 p.m. local time start for an afternoon of music and speeches, the question remained on many minds: Would people come?

""We've been trying to encourage people,"" said one helper as she descended a ladder on the stage amid final preparations. ""We keep calling our friends to tell them!""

From an hour ahead of showtime, the seats gradually filled up. ""In Chinese culture, this is about uniting with family ¨C but because of COVID-19 we haven't had the chance to do that,"" explained one attendee.

Could the chance to celebrate in-person again after so long boost numbers? Organizers and surrounding businesses were hoping so.

The pandemic has wreaked havoc on the entire eco-system of city centers and Chinatowns are often part of that. London has been no exception.

As the clock ticked down, Linda Wan from the London Chinatown Chinese Association seemed relieved as she looked around at the clusters of families and passers-by waiting in anticipation.

""It's so great to have people back in the center of China town,"" she said. ""You can see all the lanterns that represent the returning of the light, a path for people to follow ¨C good fortune, and for luck as well.""

That luck did not extend to the weather. But as the rain poured down, the umbrellas went up and many stayed to see the speeches and subsequent performances.

That such events are allowed to take place again may be old news now, but while persuading people back to central London remains a work in progress, the signs from Soho this Sunday are so far, so good.

The Chinese ambassador to Paris says the UK, U.S. and Australia have been ""extremely irresponsible"" in forming their new security pact.

Lu Shaye told CGTN Europe countries in the Asia-Pacific region were worried about the new agreement that the three countries have signed. The so-called 'Aukus' pact will contribute to supplying Australia with nuclear-powered submarines.

Canberra pulled out of its original contract with France for a dozen attack-class submarines in a deal worth at least $66 billion and for which work was already under way. Australia says it is committed to nuclear non-proliferation and will not use nuclear weapons.

""The United States, the United Kingdom and Australia are now co-operating on the construction of nuclear submarines, this endangers peace and the stability in the Asia-Pacific region and spurs a nuclear arms race,"" said Lu Shaye.

"'Not art, not culture': Hundreds protest in Madrid against bullfights","00:59

Hundreds gathered outside Las Ventas bullring in Madrid on Saturday for the ""Mission abolition"" rally to protest against bullfighting in Spain. The protest, organized animal rights political party PACMA, moved through the streets of the Spanish capital with a crowd waving green handkerchiefs and chanting slogans including ""Torture is not art nor culture"" and ""Stop torture, this is not culture."" READ MORE Rhino drowns at Dutch zoo Helsinki's 'rage room' Europe's new Indo-pacific strategy Bullfighting is an emblematic tradition for Spain, but one that has widely lost consensus among the public. An Electomania poll from 2020 found that only 18.6 percent of respondents wanted to keep the tradition. However, although 46.7 percent supported legally banning bullfighting, a significant 34.7 percent said that while they didn't support bullfighting, they wouldn't approve of banning it either.

The debate around bullfighting in Spain has been a very controversial one for at least two decades. In 2010 Catalonia's government attempted to ban bullfighting in the region, but the decision was overturned by the Spanish government in 2016, when Spain's constitutional court ruled that bullfighting was part of Spain's cultural heritage and should be protected as such. In 2020, the Spanish bullfighting lobby applied for bullfighting to be recognized by UNESCO as a ""cultural heritage in urgent need of protection,"" but UNESCO rejected the application. Animal rights activists rejoiced in that decision.

""It's a real aberration, and I find it incredible that in the 21st century and in the year we are in, that all this continues to be promoted and with public money, when it is fully known that there is a higher percentage of people against bullfighting than for bullfighting nowadays,"" protester Natalia Rodr¨ªguez told AFP reporters on Saturday. ""Culture has many good things, all of them, but of course bullfighting, killing, for me is not art.

""In other words, the sensitivity of animals and their capacity to suffer is recognized, but at the same time this exclusion is made. This is an absolute contradiction, it makes no sense at all.""

Germany's election process, is quite complicated ¨C and purposefully so. It has been set up this way to protect the country from the previous political structures that allowed the rise of Nazi Germany, and has been proven to have worked for more than 70 years. One of the complexities is the relationship between Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democratic Union party (CDU) and Bavaria's Christian Social Union (CSU). READ MORE: Europe unveils new Indo-Pacific strategy Ex-hitman's 'rage room' in Helsinki proving a smash hit with women Rhino drowns at Dutch zoo during mating accident The two parties campaign together and sit in the Bundestag, the German parliament ¨C but the CSU is the only state party to be represented in the federal parliament. Why is this so? ""It's simply about arithmetic,"" says Karsten Fischer, who is a professor of political theory at Munich's Ludwig Maximilians university. ¡°The CSU is only active in Bavaria and they do not run in federal elections,"" he explains. ""But the CSU is so strong in Bavaria that it's the third-largest party in Germany ¨C so the CDU would not be as strong as it is without the CSU.""

The CSU was founded in 1945 at the end of of World War II and is the third biggest party in Germany. /Christof Stache/AFP The CSU was founded in 1945 at the end of of World War II and is the third biggest party in Germany. /Christof Stache/AFP

The history of CSU The CSU was founded in 1945 at the end of World War II, to support struggling Bavarian agriculture and promote the state's predominant Catholic culture. As time went on and Bavaria witnessed sharp economic growth, some would argue due to the policies of the CSU, the party's support base widened to include the prosperous middle and upper class. For decades, the CSU ruled the state with an absolute majority. This led the federal CDU, which runs in every other German state, to partner with them. After all, CSU supporters regularly make up between seven and 10 percent of votes in federal elections, giving those voters significant political influence across the country. This union has enabled the CDU to run the German government longer than all other post-war parties.

The two parties have had differences over their policies which have in the past put their alliance at risk. /Sophie Makris/AFP The two parties have had differences over their policies which have in the past put their alliance at risk. /Sophie Makris/AFP

What are the policies? For the most part, CSU's politics runs in parallel with those of the CDU. However, there have been times when the CSU's more conservative policies have clashed with those of the CDU. This policy difference played out in 2017 following Merkel's decision to welcome more than one million refugees into the country, many of whom arrived through the southern state of Bavaria. It led the CSU to reconsider its alliance with CDU over its immigration policies, which could have led to a collapse of the entire government. Who could become the next chancellor? Germany's chancellors have mainly been from the CDU, but on two occasions, a CSU politician was put forward by the two-party union ¨C and each candidate failed to get the majority vote of the German parliament. This time, the CDU and CSU had to introduce a new candidate for the top job after four-time chancellor Angela Merkel refused to run for a re-election. CSU leader Markus S?der was considered, but lost the candidacy to CDU party head Armin Laschet despite having more general public support. Analysts say this was due to the historic inability of a state party leader to convince the federal parliament that they are right candidate for the job. However, Laschet has recently been criticized for his alleged lack of dynamism and for other campaign weaknesses. This has affected the party's ratings leading up to the elections and left some wondering if S?der might have been the better man for the job.

After a parliamentary session that lasted more than 20 hours, Edi Rama was voted as prime minister for the third time. Of his 17-member cabinet, 12 will be women ¨C 70.5 percent. Rama said that ""this new government will enter history as the cabinet with the highest number of women.""

Rama's left-wing Socialist Party secured a record third consecutive mandate in an April 25 parliamentary election, with 74 representatives in the 140-seat parliament. The main opposition center-right Democratic Party won 59 seats.

After the marathon approval session, parliament voted 77-53 to approve Rama's cabinet and program. The government will be expected to complete the country's reconstruction following the November 2019 earthquake, as well as fighting corruption and drug trafficking.

Rama wants to make Albania ""an absolute champion of tourism in the Balkans"" by the end of the decade and hopes to launch full membership negotiations with the European Union later this year.

The female-dominated cabinet is the latest example of a general move toward equality in European politics, although progress is quicker in some countries than others, and there is still some way to go.

According to the European Parliamentary Research Service, the EU parliament itself currently has 38.9 percent female membership, while the continental average is 30.5 percent.

Russian President Vladimir Putin's party looks likely to retain its parliamentary majority in the three-day elections, which finish on Sunday ¨C after opposition attempts to topple the incumbents were hampered by tech giants restricting tactical voting apps and information.

Putin's highest-profile critic Alexei Navalny has already been jailed and with his organizations banned for being ""extremist,"" anyone associated with his groups was excluded from running in this weekend's parliamentary and local elections.

On Friday, a 'Smart Voting' app produced by Navalny's group, which informed supporters which candidate was most likely to unseat Putin-supporting United Russia politicians, was removed by both Apple and Google. The Telegram app popular in Russia soon followed suit. AFP news agency sources said the companies faced threats of serious criminal charges and incarceration of local staff.

Navalny's team still sought to release the same information via publicly available Google Docs lists and YouTube videos, but by the early hours of Sunday these too had been blocked. Google, which owns YouTube, did not immediately respond to news agencies' requests for comment.

Opposition groups blamed Russia's media regulator Roskomnadzor. When the Google Docs and YouTube videos were published as a back-up, Navalny's banned Anti-Corruption Foundation tweeted, ""How quickly will Roskomnadzor write another request and YouTube will fulfill it? Let's see.""

Claims of ballot-stuffing

There have been widespread claims of electoral fraud. The Golos election-monitoring movement, which authorities branded a ""foreign agent"" ahead of the polls, and independent media reported thousands of violations.

The alleged fraud includes vote-buying and lax measures for guarding ballots at polling stations. Golos claims included ballots being stored overnight in a cabinet with a broken door, while envelopes for storing ballot tallies appeared to have been opened and then resealed.

Central Elections Commission head Ella Pamfilova said that more than 6,200 ballots had been annulled in five regions for procedural violations and ballot-stuffing. Pamfilova included reports of voting ""coercion."""

UK travel industry welcomes plans to scrap PCR tests for passengers,"Fully vaccinated travelers arriving in England won't be required to take a PCR test. /Tolga Akmen/AFP Fully vaccinated travelers arriving in England won't be required to take a PCR test. /Tolga Akmen/AFP

The UK Transport Ministry has announced two main changes to its COVID-19 travel regulations for travelers entering England. First, costly pre- and post-arrival PCR tests will be scrapped for the double vaccinated. Instead, they will just be required to show negative lateral flow test results, which are much cheaper. The price of multiple tests was a barrier to travel for many people and something the tourism industry had complained bitterly about.

Second, the UK's traffic light system, whereby a country would fall into a red, orange or green category based on the level of risk, will also be scrapped and replaced with a simpler ""go"" or ""no-go"" list. The new system kicks in at the end of the English school half-term in October, allowing families to return from a foreign break with less hassle. In the meantime, eight more countries have immediately been added to the UK's green list ¨C including Pakistan, Turkey and Kenya.

Travel agencies are reporting a surge in travel bookings as a result. Thomas Cook reported its second busiest day of bookings this year, with a bumper weekend expected. Airline stocks have also risen on the news. One important thing to note is that receiving countries will still have their own requirements ¨C meaning they will still be able to restrict entry from the UK, and may still have their own more expensive pre and post-arrival testing requirements. Opposition parties have raised concerns about the dropping of PCR tests, saying it will make it more difficult to monitor the spread of new variants through genetic sequencing that is only possible with PCR test samples. The Scottish government will keep the PCR test requirements in place but, like England, it will also adopt the new two-tiered travel system. The unvaccinated will still be required to pay for PCR tests. Those returning from ""no go"" countries will still have to quarantine in a government-sponsored hotel for 10 days. Some travel executives want the government to go even further, saying England's coronavirus travel restrictions remain more stringent than some of their European neighbors."

Telegram announced it would ""limit the functioning of bots associated with election campaigns,"" saying that it was in keeping with Russian election legislation and urged customers to respect the decision.

The bot showed which candidate voters should back to unseat politicians from Vladimir Putin's United Russia party in an election that has already seen a number of opposition candidates barred from standing, including anyone linked to Alexei Navalny.

The Smart Voting app devised by jailed opposition leader Alexei Navalny has been removed from Apple and Google stores at the start of Russia's three-day parliamentary vote. It is a move that has also been followed by popular Russian messenger app Telegram, following reports that authorities had threatened to fine the two U.S. companies if they refused to drop the app.

Telegram's founder Pavel Durov said he was following Apple and Google, which ""dictate the rules of the game to developers like us.""

In a post on his Telegram channel, he said the tech giants had ""already this year"" urged the encrypted messenger, widely popular in Russia, to remove information that violates the laws of individual countries or face exclusion from their app stores.

But he added that ""the blocking of applications by Apple and Google creates a dangerous precedent that will affect freedom of speech in Russia and around the world.""

The election for seats in the lower house State Duma comes after a sweeping crackdown on President Putin's opponents. Navalny, who was arrested and jailed for violating the conditions of a suspended sentence, has seen his allies arrested or flee the country, has nonetheless aimed to impact the elections from behind bars.

His allies accused Apple and Google of ""censorship,"" while sources told AFP news agency that the companies had faced private threats of serious criminal charges and incarceration of local staff from Russian authorities.

President Putin has already cast his vote and sent this message to the Russian people, ""The election of a new legislature is a vital event in the life of our society, our country.

All of us are equally interested in electing responsible, energetic and respected members of parliament, who can keep their word, fulfill your requests and their promises and live up to the hopes and trust of the citizens of Russia.""

The polls close on Sunday 19, September."
UK rules for vaccinated travelers goes against WHO advice,"World Health Organization Director-General, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, has repeatedly called for vaccine equity. Reuters/Mohamed Azakir World Health Organization Director-General, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, has repeatedly called for vaccine equity. Reuters/Mohamed Azakir

The British government's shake-up to its rules for international travel during the pandemic appears to fly in the face of the World Health Organization's (WHO) calls for all vaccines to be treated equally. From October 4, the UK says travelers to England will no longer need to quarantine upon arrival only if they are fully vaccinated with jabs approved by health regulators in the EU, U.S. and UK. That's good news for people who have received the full dose of AstraZeneca, Pfizer, Moderna or Janssen vaccines, but it excludes people who have been vaccinated with jabs such as Russia's Sputnik or China's Sinopharm. Sinopharm was granted emergency approval by the WHO earlier this year but hasn't received backing from the European Medicines Agency or America's Food and Drug Administration.

""Any measure that only allows people protected by a subset of WHO-approved vaccines to benefit from the re-opening of travel into and with that region would effectively create a two-tier system,"" the WHO warned earlier this year. ""At a time when the world is trying to resume trade, commerce and travel, this is counter-effective, both in spirit and outcome."" Campaigners for vaccine equity have argued that moves such as the UK's new travel rules could dent confidence in some vaccines and further exacerbate the disjointed nature of the global economic recovery from the pandemic. The UK's Transport Secretary Grant Shapps says the new rules create ""a simpler, more straightforward system. One with less testing and lower costs, allowing more people to travel, see loved ones or conduct business around the world while providing a boost for the travel industry."""
Denmark wants to prevent prisoners sentenced to life from new romances,"Madsen in the control room of his crowdfunded UC3 Nautilus submarine where he murdered a journalist before dumping her body at sea. /AFP Madsen in the control room of his crowdfunded UC3 Nautilus submarine where he murdered a journalist before dumping her body at sea. /AFP

The Danish government wants to ban prisoners serving life sentences from entering new relationships, saying inmates ""should not have the opportunity to spend time in prisons dating or advertising their crimes on, for example, social media."" The move follows the controversy around Peter Madsen, known as 'the submarine killer,' who is involved in a new romance with a 17-year-old who revealed she had fallen in love with Madsen while he was in custody. Madsen was given a life sentence in 2018 after being found guilty of the murder of Swedish journalist Kim Wall, 30, who he lured aboard his homemade submarine with the promise of an interview.

The trial revealed Madsen sexually assaulted the reporter, then dismembered her body and dumped it at sea, in what police considered an attempt at destroying evidence of the crime. Madsen admitted to throwing Wall's body parts in the Baltic Sea but always denied murdering the reporter, which he claims died accidentally inside the submarine. He's serving the most severe punishment under the Danish penal code, a life sentence, which in Denmark is usually 16 to 17 years long, with the possibility of an extension if the person is considered likely to commit another crime. Inmates in Danish prisons serving a long sentence are currently allowed to be in contact with people outside by telephone, letter and visits, an opportunity that allowed Madsen to marry Russian artist in exile Jenny Curpen while in prison after a long correspondence and visits, and then form a long-distance relationship with Camilla Kurstein, who was 17 at the time.

""In recent years, we have seen distasteful examples of inmates who have committed bestial crimes contacting very young people, to gain their sympathy and attention. Of course, we have to stop that,"" said Justice Minister Nick Haekkerup this week, after submitting a bill to lawmakers that, if passed, will restrict inmates serving life sentences from contacting new people outside during the first 10 years of detention. Correspondence and visitation rights will remain for people the inmates knew before incarceration. If approved by the Danish Parliament, the 179-seat Folketing, the ban would come into force on January 1, 2022. The center-right opposition, which has long been calling to limit prison visitation rights, has already said it backs the proposal.

"Italy makes jabs mandatory, UK's new travel rules: COVID-19 Bulletin","TOP HEADLINES

? Bookings for COVID-19 jabs increased in Italy on Friday after some of the strictest anti-coronavirus measures adopted in the world came into force. From October 15, any employee who fails to show proof of vaccination, a negative test or recent recovery from the infection will be automatically suspended without pay.

? Switzerland has announced that all travelers who are not fully vaccinated will be required to show proof of a negative test when entering the country. Bern said the measures, which come into force on September 20, are being introduced to prevent a spike in cases once people start returning from their autumn vacation.

? UK Transport Minister Grant Shapps announced relaxation of international travel rules to England, on Friday, in a boost to the tourism industry. Fully vaccinated passengers will no longer need to take pre-departure PCR tests on arrival from low-risk countries from October 4.

? From the end of October, those traveling to England from approved countries will only have to take a rapid lateral flow test on day two of their stay. Under the new rules, Eight countries, including Turkey and Pakistan, will be removed from the current red list, which requires passengers to quarantine in a hotel.

? Scotland will continue to require travelers to take pre-departure and day-two PCR tests ""due to significant concerns at the impact on public health.""

? Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo has criticized those who refuse to get vaccinated for putting others at risk and slowing down the efforts to relax restrictions. ""This epidemic is becoming an epidemic of unvaccinated people. It is not defensible,"" De Croo told a news conference.

? A new study released by the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention is the latest to suggest that the Moderna vaccine offers better long-term protection against hospitalization, compared to the Pfizer jab.

? Police officers were amongst the wounded as hundreds of protesters were arrested in Melbourne, Australia's second-most-populous city, on Saturday in violent clashes at an anti-lockdown march. Officers used pepper spray and made over 200 arrests as several hundred attendees flouted stay-at-home orders and marched through an inner-city suburb, as the city goes through its sixth lockdown since the pandemic started."

The attacks were the first deadly blasts since the withdrawal of U.S. troops at the end of August, and at least one of them is believed to have been aimed at Taliban vehicles.

""In one attack, a Taliban vehicle patrolling in Jalalabad was targeted,"" a Taliban official who asked not to be named told AFP. ""Women and children were among the injured,"" he added.

No group has claimed responsibility for the deadly attacks."
"Med7 meeting focuses on the climate crisis, safety and migration","The group was joined by Slovenia and Croatia, making the Greek summit a meeting of the Med9.

Leaders of the Med7 ¨C a grouping of the southern EU countries Cyprus, Italy, France, Malta, Spain, Portugal and Greece ¨C met on Friday in Athens to discuss the climate and safety challenges facing the region.

The one-day meeting, also attended by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, focused heavily on what Greek government spokesman Yiannis Economou called issues ""jeopardizing safety and stability in the Mediterranean,"" including a possible influx of refugees from Afghanistan.

Greece and other southern EU states including Italy have long complained about a lack of support from their northern peers in handling migration, with Mediterranean countries facing most migrant arrivals.

In response to fears of a new migration crisis such as the one in 2015, the EU has committed $326 million for new migrant camps on the Greek islands receiving most arrivals by sea from neighboring Turkey.

And after Greece suffered greatly from devastating wildfires this summer, Economou said the Greek government placed particular emphasis on the need for joint action to tackle climate change."

U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi cautioned the UK there could be no post-Brexit trade deal with the U.S. if the Northern Ireland peace agreement was destroyed.

The U.S. has expressed grave concern that a row between London and Brussels over the implementation of the 2020 Brexit Withdrawal Agreement could undermine the Good Friday Agreement, which effectively ended three decades of violence.

""If there is destruction of the Good Friday accords, they [are] very unlikely to have a UK-U.S. bilateral [trade deal],"" she told a Chatham House event.

Since the UK left the European Union, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has unilaterally delayed the implementation of some provisions of the deal's Northern Ireland Protocol, while his top negotiator has said the protocol is unsustainable.

The 1998 peace deal largely brought an end to the so-called ""Troubles"" ¨C three decades of conflict between mostly Irish Catholic nationalist militants against the British state and Protestant ""loyalist"" paramilitaries, in which 3,600 people were killed.

The British-run region remains deeply split along sectarian lines 23 years after the peace deal brokered by the U.S..

Many nationalists aspire to unification with Ireland, while unionists want to stay part of the UK.

The Northern Ireland Protocol aims to keep the province, which borders EU member Ireland, in both the UK's customs territory and the EU's single market.

The EU wants to protect its single market and avoid bringing back a visible border with border checks between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. But the solution has resulted in what is effectively a trade border in the Irish Sea between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom ¨C to the fury of Protestant unionists.

Some unionists say the protocol contravenes the 1998 peace deal."
U.S. urged to tackle human rights abuses on its own soil,"The U.S. has been urged to clamp down on human trafficking and sexual slavery at the United Nations (UN) Council for Human Rights.

Delivering a statement on behalf of China, Burundi, Venezuela, Syria, Iran and the DPRK, Jiang Duan, a minister in the Chinese delegation, called for an investigation into human rights practices in America.

He cited figures, matching those from a U.S. government report, suggesting that between 240,000 and 325,000 young people in the U.S were at risk of sexual exploitation. In addition, 100,000 people were trafficked into the U.S. each year, Jiang said. However the figures around this issue are controversial and difficult to measure accurately.

He added that 500,000 people were victims of modern slavery in the U.S.. The Global Slavery Index puts the figure at 400,000.

""Behind these numbers are tragedies, broken families and individuals whose fundamental rights are trampled upon,"" Jiang told fellow delegates by videolink.

""The connivance, indifference and inaction of the U.S. government are the root causes of rampant human trafficking and forced labor in the U.S.,"" he added, saying that discrimination, poverty, drug crime and the proliferation of guns combine to exacerbate the problems."
Rhino drowns at Dutch zoo during mating accident,"A female rhino drowned at a zoo in the Netherlands as she was trying to escape the attentions of a male rhino introduced in her facility for mating, the Wildlands zoo announced on Friday.

Elena, one of the two female rhinos in the enclosure together with another named Zahra, was ""startled"" by the arrival of Limpopo, a 19-year-old white rhino who joined the park in early September from another Dutch zoo. There, Limpopo had managed to successfully father three offspring as part of a European breeding program.

The zoo reported that the male rhino had already met other species within the zoo, such as zebras, wildebeest and giraffes, and the introduction went smoothly. During this time, the female rhinos and Limpopo had got to know each other through different pens, smelling and seeing each other from a distance. But things went wrong when Limpopo was finally introduced into the pen with Elena and Zahra. The two females were said to be ""shocked"" and started running away from him, and Limpopo gave chase. Wildlands zoo said that ""Limpopo committed the pursuit. He seemed particularly focused on Elena because she was the closest,"" reads a post on Facebook.

Both animals were apparently exhausted after 15 minutes of running and Elena walked towards a shallow water hole and slipped in, unable to get up again. Zoo caretakers removed Limpopo from the pen and tried to rescue Elena, but it was too late for the female rhino, who drowned. ""You want to jump over there and lift her head above water but you couldn't. Rhinos are not only very dangerous, but they also weigh almost 2,000 kilos,"" zoo vet Job Stumpel told the AD newspaper. ""We raced to it with a shovel and chased the male away with it, so we could get to the female, but it was too late."" Limpopo had been moved from a German zoo six years ago because he ""didn't treat the female there properly,"" the Brabants Dagblad newspaper said. The zoo reported that it is unsure what will happen now to the breeding program of the facility.

Italy is set to make its COVID-19 ""Green Pass"" mandatory for all workers from next month, becoming the first European country to do so.

The country is trying to accelerate vaccinations and stamp out infections and the new rules are some of the strictest anti-COVID-19 measures in the world.

They will come into force on October 15 in what is the latest effort by Italy's Prime Minister Mario Draghi to persuade more people to get inoculated.

Among European Union members, Italy has the highest number of deaths from the coronavirus and the third-highest total of COVID-19 cases.

France begins third doses rollout

Marzipan tribute to Angela Merkel



The green pass can be in digital or paper form and it shows proof that someone has received at least one COVID-19 vaccine dose, or recently tested negative, or recently recovered from the virus.

The health pass was originally conceived to ease travel among EU states, but some countries have started deploying it to control public access to certain locations in a bid to force the unvaccinated to get the jab, or take a test.

France suspends 3,000 health workers

France's health pass has been in force in museums, cinemas and sports centers since late July and on August 9 it was imposed on bars, restaurants, cafes and on long-haul trains and buses.

The obligation to show the pass forced a surge in coronavirus shots, with France set to break through the mark of 50 million first-vaccinations this weekend.

But the vaccination program has not been without controversy.

Health Minister Olivier Veran said Thursday that around 3,000 health workers had been suspended for their failure to get vaccinated.

In June, President Emmanuel Macron announced the government's summer strategy would have two main measures imposed ¨C the health pass and the obligation on doctors, nurses and carers to get vaccinated by the middle of this month.

That announcement sparked a summer of weekly protests across the country, with more than 200,000 people at the movement's peak demonstrating against the health pass and the move to force paramedics, firefighters and surgeons to get the vaccine.

In March, Italy ordered its health workers to get vaccinated or face suspension. More than 700 of them have been suspended since, the Italian doctors' federation said Thursday."
Technology empowers the poor ¨C if they can access and use it,"Farmers in isolated rural areas usually don't have the same access to new technologies as their wealthier counterparts. This leads to higher costs and lower yields and a considerable disadvantage on the open market.

Sheng Guangning is a drone pilot. She travels around China demonstrating how the unmanned aircraft can spray and water crops far more efficiently than through manual labor.

In her monovlog for CGTN's Pathfinders project, she explains that using new technologies not only decreases costs for farmers but also provides new employment opportunities.

""If farmers come to us for training, they'll be equipped with more skills, which is equal to poverty alleviation through technology. If they obtain drone-operating licenses, these farmers can be employed to spray the farmland for others and make a living off service fees.

""This will boost the employment rate in the countryside.

UK protesters demand government help to replace deadly cladding,"Making her building safe will cost almost $19.2 million, which works out at around $55,000 per household. It's money that Shalloo insists neither she nor her neighbors have.

Paula Shalloo told CGTN: ""It's the first thing you think about when you wake up in the morning and it's the last thing you think about at night.""

Leaseholders caught up in what has become known colloquially as the ""cladding scandal"" want more help from the UK government to help fix the problem.

Hundreds of protesters in the UK have gathered outside the Houses of Parliament in their fight to remove potentially deadly cladding from their homes.

""I call it a constant, sort of low-level hum of anxiety, because we're worried about our safety, our finances, and our future,"" she said. ""We can't move on with our lives until this is resolved.""

In June 2017, 72 people died when a small electrical fire spread to the external cladding of Grenfell Tower in London and quickly consumed the building.

Inspections in the aftermath of the tragedy found that hundreds of buildings across the UK were clad in flammable material.

Steph Pike bought her flat in Bristol, in southwest England, a few months after the Grenfell tragedy. Professional surveys reassured her that the building wasn't one of those affected.

In 2019, she discovered some of the cladding was flammable. Then last year, flammable insulation and a lack of other fire safety measures were found in her building.

""There are so many different people who are responsible,"" said Pike.

""Whether it's the builders, or the government failing to regulate properly, or the manufacturers of these products who knew they were flammable, or the building control for signing off a building and not checking it was compliant. It seems all these parties have been negligent in some way, but all of the cost has been shifted to the innocent leaseholders.""

Pike and her neighbors are waiting to find out if they will qualify for some of the $6.9 billion the UK government has promised to spend on the problem.

Changes to some fire safety rules for smaller buildings should mean mortgage companies are willing to lend to those wanting to buy flats in them. However, those living in potentially dangerous homes want more money and more action to help end their ongoing nightmare."

TOP HEADLINES

? The British government will on Friday consider easing England's COVID-19 rules for international travel ¨C a late-season boost for airlines, holiday and tourism companies, which say they will not survive another winter of onerous rules and red tape.

While Europe has relaxed travel restrictions for the fully vaccinated, expensive testing requirements remain in place for fully vaccinated arrivals into Britain, hampering a travel recovery as the tougher winter period nears.

? The first civil lawsuit begins in a court in Vienna over a notorious outbreak of coronavirus at the popular ski resort of Ischgl in March 2020, where thousands of people, from 45 countries, claim to have become infected.

The case is the first of 15 lawsuits filed by plaintiffs from Austria and Germany, accusing the authorities of not responding quickly enough to COVID-19 outbreaks in Ischgl and other resorts in the province of Tyrol.

It is being brought on behalf of the family of 72-year-old Hannes Schopf, who died after contracting the virus in Ischgl.

? The Netherlands will require proof of a vaccination or a recent negative coronavirus test for entry to bars, restaurants, museums, theaters and other cultural events from September 25, as almost all social distancing measures are dropped.

? A motion calling on the Dutch government to change its mind about the so-called ""corona pass"" was rejected by a narrow majority late on Thursday. Prime Minister Mark Rutte said it was needed to prevent a new wave of infections.

""We are still in a dangerous situation. Not doing this would bring great risks,"" Rutte said during a heated debate in parliament.

? British researchers will look into the immune responses of children to mixed schedules of different vaccines as officials try to determine the best approach to second doses in adolescents, given there is a small risk of heart inflammation.

The trial will give all participants a first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. That will be followed eight weeks later by either a second full dose or a half dose of the Pfizer shot, a full dose of Novavax's jab or a half dose of Moderna's shot.

The trial's lead researcher, Matthew Snape of the Oxford Vaccine Group, is running another branch of the trial in adults, giving mixed vaccine schedules both four and 12 weeks apart, and comparing the responses. He said the results of that would be coming ""very shortly.""

? English soccer club Manchester City's official supporters club has told manager Pep Guardiola to stick to coaching after he commented on the thousands of empty seats for their Champions League win over RB Leipzig at the Etihad Stadium on Wednesday.

Kevin Parker, the general secretary of City's official supporters' club, told British media he was surprised by Guardiola's comments.

""They've got kids to think of, they might not be able to afford it, there are still some COVID-19 issues about ... I don't see why he comments on it,"" he said.

Citroen pursuing aggressive Out of Europe program ¨C CEO Vincent Cobee,"04:31

Citroen's CEO has told CGTN the French car giant's New C3 model is part of a bid to increase sales outside of the continent to 30 percent by mid-decade. It comes amid a European sales slump worsened by growing consumer fatigue with vehicle ownership. Vincent Cobee said this week's launch, aimed at India and South America, was part of Citroen's ""aggressive Out of Europe growth program."" The New C3, marketed as an affordable supermini, was built in Citroen plants in the Indian city of Chennai and Porto Real in Brazil. Cobee also revealed he expects the global semiconductor shortage that has blighted the automotive industry to last at least another year.

Asked by CGTN where Citroen's largest future market will be, Cobee replied: ""When you look at market size, India is going to become the third-largest market in the world before the end of the decade. South America is a fast-growing region in the car industry. We are newcomers there. ""In South America, there are substantial markets. We've been there for 15 years, with great results.

Statue of anonymous Bitcoin founder unveiled in Hungary,"Hungary's capital Budapest is now home to the first statue of Bitcoin's anonymous founder. The figure behind the cryptocurrency has never revealed their identity but goes by the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto and is credited as a kind of philosophical leader in digital currency.

One of the people behind the statue, Andras Gyorfi, told CGTN the most important element of the unique artwork was its face.

""It represents Satoshi ¨C of course we don't know how he looked but this statue has a stylized face made from a bronze aluminum composite which is reflective¡­ if you go to the statue, look in its face and you are going to see your own face.""

The reflection is meant to serve a message that we are all part of the cryptocurrency market, that everyone involved is a kind of Satoshi. The statue also wears a hoodie to represent the internet generation, many of whom pioneered working from home and in less traditional workspaces.

Europe unveils new Indo-Pacific strategy,"The European Commission unveiled its strategy for the Indo-Pacific region just hours after the UK, U.S. and Australia announced a new defense pact.



Named Aukus, the tripartite arrangement will see Washington and London sharing technology with the Australian military, which will eventually be able to deploy nuclear-powered submarines. European leaders in Brussels, though, said they had been blindsided.



""We've only just been made aware of the alliance, and certainly we weren't consulted. As High-Representative for security policy for the European Union, I was not made aware,"" said Josep Borrell, the European Commission's high representative for foreign affairs. ""I assume such an arrangement has been worked on for a while, but we weren't part and parcel of it.

""This is a good opportunity to remind people of the importance of the Indo-Pacific strategy that we ourselves are focused on, and make this strategy more important,"" he said, as he unveiled the EU's new blueprint in Brussels.

""With today's proposals, and guided by our values, we are offering a strengthened partnership to advance trade, investment and connectivity, while addressing common global challenges and reinforcing the rules-based international order,"" added European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.

China calls U.S.-UK-Australia 'Aukus' security pact irresponsible,"China says a new defense and security pact between the UK, U.S. and Australia will damage peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific region. The so-called Aukus alliance will help Canberra to acquire nuclear-powered submarines.

Submarines are at the heart of the new agreement initially ¨C but it will go on to encompass artificial intelligence and other advance technologies.

The leaders of the three countries said the aim of the Aukus deal was to preserve peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific region.

None of them mentioned China by name - but Beijing's presence in the region is the subtext.

"Stop bashing gas, says energy expert amid European fuel price surge","03:40

With record-high energy bills expected to hit European consumers this winter, a leading independent analyst has told CGTN that world powers must be ""less gung-ho"" in their race to net zero.

The EU's poorest member state has been struggling to form a regular government after voting out former center-right prime minister Boyko Borissov following almost a decade of political dominance.

Public anger over widespread corruption helped defeat Borissov, but wrangling and rivalry have prevented his political opponents from forging a government with a majority in parliament.

Radev, who is running for re-election as president in a vote which will also be held on November 14, re-appointed Yanev and all but three of the interim ministers who took office in May after the April vote.

""You have already proven that you have the stamina to face a difficult legacy and work for the future of Bulgaria,"" Radev, a harsh critic of Borissov, said at an inauguration ceremony for Yanev.

Government tries to boost vaccine take up

During Yanev's first interim stint, the new administration claimed that Borissov's government spent billions of taxpayer money on infrastructure projects without proper procurement, among other shortcomings.

It also pushed through a revision of the state budget to provide support for businesses and pensioners amid a fourth wave of the pandemic. But it has failed to significantly boost vaccinations against the virus, and the country has the lowest inoculation rate in the bloc.

Two of its most popular members, Economy Minister Kiril Petkov and Finance Minister Assen Vassilev, will not be part of the new administration as the two will be launching their own political faction to drive change ahead of the November polls.

Radev appointed Valery Beltchev, a Harvard University graduate with a long track record in banking and public finance, as interim finance minister."
U.S.-UK-Australia defense deal a 'stab in the back' says France,"06:56

France's foreign minister says a nuclear submarine deal announced by Australia as part of a new alliance with the U.S. and the UK is a ""stab in the back"" for his country. ""I'm very angry today, and bitter... this is not something allies do to each other,"" Jean-Yves Le Drian said after the surprise deal which scraps Australia's existing submarine deal with France. That French deal, worth around $36.5 billion at the time of signing in 2016, had been personally backed by President Emmanuel Macron. The U.S.'s announcement of its deal with Australia and the UK includes Canberra having a nuclear-powered submarine fleet and receiving American cruise missiles.

Asked if Paris had been ""duped"" by the U.S. over what he had once called a ""contract of the century"" for France's naval yards, Le Drian replied: ""Your analysis of the situation is more or less correct."" French defense minister Florence Parly called Australia's move ""very bad news with regards to keeping one's word,"" adding that France was ""clear-eyed as to how the United States treats its allies."" ""In terms of geopolitics and international relations, it's serious,"" she told RFI radio on Thursday. U.S. and UK seek to placate Paris Speaking in Washington, U.S. President Joe Biden called France a ""key partner and ally"" in the Asia-Pacific region. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson echoed these sentiments, telling parliament ""our relationship with France, our military relationship with France... is rock solid."" Johnson added: ""We stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the French, whether in the Sahel, where we are running a joint operation against terrorists in Mali, or whether in Estonia, where we currently have the largest NATO operation."" The reassurances have fallen flat in Paris, with Le Drian telling Franceinfo radio: ""This brutal, unilateral and unpredictable decision reminds me a lot of what Mr [Donald] Trump used to do."" ""This is a decision contrary to the letter and the spirit of the cooperation that prevailed between France and Australia,"" the foreign ministry said in a statement. ""The American choice, which leads to the removal of an ally and a European partner like France from a longstanding partnership with Australia, at a time when we are facing unprecedented challenges in the Indo-Pacific region... marks a lack of consistency that France cannot but note and regret,"" it added. The European Union also said it had not received advance warning of the pact:

China criticizes 'Cold War thinking' Separately, China condemned the deal as an ""extremely irresponsible"" threat to stability in the Indo-Pacific region. Foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said it ""seriously undermines regional peace and stability and intensifies the arms race."" Zhao said the Western allies should ""abandon their outdated Cold War zero-sum thinking"" or risk ""shooting themselves in the foot."" None of the three countries' leaders mentioned China in unveiling their alliance, dubbed AUKUS ¨C but they have previously made no secret of their concerns about the capabilities of China's military. ""This initiative is about making sure that each of us has a modern capability ¨C the most modern capabilities we need - to maneuver and defend against rapidly evolving threats,"" Biden said. UK leader Johnson said the deal reflected the three countries' close relations and shared values and shared interest in things such as ""promoting democracy,"" but asked directly about China, he told members of parliament the deal ""is not intended to be adversarial towards any other power.""

At the center of the deal are eight state-of-the-art nuclear-powered submarines for Australia. The submarines, said Biden and the other leaders, will not be nuclear-armed, only powered with nuclear reactors. But they will allow Australia's military to travel, and strike targets, far from its coast. ""[They] are quieter, faster and have longer endurance, which will allow Australia to deploy its future submarines to Indo-Pacific locations for much longer periods of time,"" Ashley Townshend, of the United States Studies Centre at the University of Sydney, told AFP. In addition to the submarine fleet, a senior Biden administration official said AUKUS would combine forces on ""cyber, AI ¨C particularly applied AI ¨C quantum technologies and some undersea capabilities as well."" Morrison later announced Australia would also acquire long-range U.S. Tomahawk cruise missiles. He also offered an ""open invitation"" to Chinese President Xi Jinping for talks.

"Marks & Spencer closing French stores, blaming post-Brexit trade rules","The UK retailer Marks and Spencer is to close the 11 franchise food stores it runs with partner SFH in France, saying new trade rules brought in since Brexit were affecting supplies of fresh and chilled products.

Marks and Spencer (M&S) has warned that it has struggled to get some goods into Ireland and France since the UK left the European Union's single market at the beginning of the year, because of the additional paperwork required.

""M&S has a long history of serving customers in France and this is not a decision we or our partner SFH have taken lightly,"" said Paul Friston, M&S's international director.

? New data from Moderna's large vaccine trial shows that the protection it offers against getting COVID-19 wanes over time, supporting the case for booster doses, the company said in a news release on Wednesday.

""This is only one estimate, but we do believe this means as you look toward the fall and winter, at minimum we expect the estimated impact of waning immunity would be 600,000 additional cases of COVID-19,"" Moderna president Stephen Hoge said on a conference call with investors. Hoge said data from its booster studies shows the vaccine could increase neutralizing antibodies to levels even higher than were seen after the second dose.

A separate study suggested the Moderna vaccine was 96 percent effective at stopping hospitalization ¨C and in its news briefing Moderna said that there was little evidence of this figure waning so far.

? A number of countries are currently planning to bring in booster shots ¨C including the UK, where a study published this week showed that although vaccines remain effective at preventing hospitalization and death, their effectiveness does decline 20 weeks after a second dose ¨C with AstraZeneca waning by slightly more than Pfizer.

? The number of daily coronavirus-related deaths in Ukraine over the past 24 hours exceeded 100 for the first time since early June, when the country reported 118 deaths, the health ministry data showed on Thursday.

Ukraine reported 101 deaths on September 16 while the number of new infections rose to 5,744 from 4,640 a day earlier. The number of new COVID-19 cases has been growing over the past few weeks and the government has already announced that it will tighten lockdown restrictions in the near future.

? The pace of climate change has not been slowed by the pandemic and the world remains behind in its battle to cut carbon emissions, the United Nations said on Thursday.

The virus-related economic downturn caused only a temporary downturn in CO2 emissions last year and it was not enough to reverse the rising levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, the World Meteorological Organization said.

? Italy is set to make its COVID-19 ""Green Pass"" mandatory for all workers from next month, becoming the first European country to do so as it tries to accelerate vaccinations and stamp out infections. The pass, a digital or paper certificate showing someone has received at least one vaccine dose, tested negative or recently recovered from the virus, was originally conceived to ease travel among EU states.

Around 3,000 health workers who have not been vaccinated against COVID-19 have been suspended in France, Health Minister Olivier Veran said, a day after the country made vaccination mandatory for all healthcare and care home workers. French President Emmanuel Macron's government imposed the rule to boost vaccination uptake and help prevent a new wave of infections in the autumn that might jeopardize France's economic recovery.

""Most of the suspensions are only temporary... many of them have decided to get vaccinated as they see that the vaccination mandate is a reality,"" Veran told French RTL radio.

New Polish museum honors victims of mass World War II deportations,"A new museum in Bialystok, northeast Poland, is the first in the country to be dedicated to the victims of mass deportations, who, under Soviet rule, were forced to leave their home for Siberia.

Eighty-two years ago, on September 17, 1939, the Soviet Union invaded Poland. It was only a couple of weeks after Nazi Germany had invaded the country, an action that triggered World War II.

01:17

What followed were the arrests of hundreds of thousands of Polish citizens the Soviet Union identified as rebels against the new Soviet government, and mass deportations to labor camps and resettlement in Siberia. During four mass deportations starting from 1939, it is estimated that more than a million Poles were forcibly evacuated, many of whom died before reaching their destination. Among the many victims of these mass deportations was Elzbieta Smulkowa, now 90 years old and one of the last surviving Siberian deportees.

In 1941, she was forced to leave her home in suburban Warsaw with her mother and sister, after her father was arrested and killed by Soviet troops a year prior.

Now, Smulkova has a chance to share her story at the new Siberian Memorial. ""The worst was the hunger, the lack of heating and how it was impossible to help my mother any more,"" she said, recalling the years in Siberia.

""Even today I am unable to get hungry. I mean seriously. The moment I feel hungry, I rush to eat, no matter what, but I have to eat. It's encoded in my head.""

The museum, housed in the former military depot from where the deportees were sent away during World War II, showcases the oral and written accounts of surviving deportees as well the simple objects they left behind, together with the ones they relied on for their new life in Siberia.

It also bears testimony of the multi-ethnic nature of Poland at the time. Among those deported to Siberia, museum researchers found representatives of around 60 nations and ethnicities. ""The museum gives a Polish perspective because we are in Poland"" but it addresses ""a universal experience of totalitarianism, suffering and forced migration,"" said museum director Wojciech Sleszynski. After the end of the war, deportees were allowed to return to Poland, including Smulkova. ""When I crossed the Polish border [coming back from deportation] I really had this feeling that the grass is greener and the sky is bluer,"" she said. ""I'm not making that up. This color difference really marked me.""

More than 1,400 dolphins were killed on Sunday off the coast of the Faroe Islands in a single day, the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society said, as part of the Danish territory's centuries-old traditional Grindadrap hunt.

The U.S.-based non-governmental organization said the slaughter of 1,428 Atlantic white-sided dolphins is considered to be the largest single hunt of cetaceans (the category of aquatic mammals to which dolphins belong) ever recorded worldwide.

The annual dolphin drive, when several hundred pilot whales are also slaughtered for their meat and blubber, is part of a 1,000-year-old tradition in the North Atlantic archipelago.

The dolphins were herded towards land by motorboats, before being killed by whalers on the shore.

Images of local residents slashing dolphins, turning the water red with blood, have fueled protests from environmental activists who say the hunt is cruel.

This year the number of mammals slaughtered prompted an outcry from animal rights groups for the excessive killing, producing ""more dolphin meat from this hunt than anyone wants to take,"" Sea Shepherd said in a press release.

Faroe Islanders fight to preserve their tradition of killing cetaceans, which sustains a key part of their diet."

Pfizer's jab gives longer-lasting protection against COVID-19 than AstraZeneca's, according to new data. /VCG

Protection against COVID-19 wanes faster for people who have had two doses of AstraZeneca's vaccine than for those who had Pfizer's jab, according to newly released figures.

Public Health England's study on the duration of protection from COVID-19 vaccines was published on Tuesday.

It came as UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced a mass booster program for the over-50s using the Pfizer or Moderna jabs, rather than the AstraZeneca vaccine.

Many people aged over 40 in the UK received the Oxford University-developed AstraZeneca vaccine, leading to questions about why it was not being included in the booster program.

According to the study, 20 weeks after a second dose, the effectiveness of the AstraZeneca shot in stopping symptomatic COVID-19 falls, for Delta variant cases, from nearly 70 percent to 50 percent.

The anomaly in UK vaccine stats

It says the Pfizer jab's effectiveness against Delta cases also wanes, but from a high of around 90 percent, to just over 70 percent after 10 weeks.

The good news is that in terms of vaccines' effectiveness at preventing hospitalization, there is little decline in performance ¨C with Pfizer's still being 95 percent effective after 20 weeks.

AstraZeneca's shot also provides good protection against hospitalization after 20 weeks, although its effectiveness falls to just below 80 percent from the mid-90s it hits two weeks after the second dose.

Pfizer's jab remains more than 90 percent effective in terms of preventing death after 20 weeks, while AstraZeneca also shows little sign of waning, remaining in the high 80 percents.

The Public Health England paper says in conclusion: ""Overall, the results indicate that there is waning of vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic disease with both the Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines from approximately 10 weeks after the second dose. This is most evident in older adults.

""Nevertheless, protection against hospitalization remains high throughout the follow-up period and even within clinical risk groups, VE [vaccine effectiveness] against hospitalization at 15-20 weeks is 75-90 percent, with the AstraZeneca vaccine and over 90 percent with the Pfizer vaccine.""

The report from Public Health England on the real-world figures follows several studies that have shown a decline in antibodies in the months after vaccinations, which has been linked to an increase in fully vaccinated people getting symptomatic COVID-19.

What has been not known is whether this means there will be waning protection against becoming seriously ill or dying from COVID-19, which were the key metrics on which vaccines were originally judged.

A separate assessment by the UK's Vaccine Effectiveness Expert Panel, also published on Tuesday, said: ""It was agreed that there is increasing evidence that effectiveness against mildly symptomatic disease is declining over time.

""There is some evidence of waning immunity against hospitalization in older cohorts against Delta but both vaccines still offer good protection, and the evidence of waning protection against severe disease is less convincing."""

The pace of vaccination against COVID-19 must be quickened to avert ""a pandemic of the unvaccinated,"" the European Commission president said on Wednesday, also urging countries around the globe to step up the fight against climate change. Ursula von der Leyen's second State of the Union address comes after two years that have tested the bloc's resilience, with the coronavirus pandemic, a related sharp economic downturn, strains over Brexit and differences over the rule of law in some eastern member states. Here are five key takeaways from her address to the European Parliament in Strasbourg:

03:18

'European Defense Union' The chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan last month has reignited a long-running debate about the EU's military capabilities. Von der Leyen, though, said on Wednesday that Europe's leaders need to do more than organize troops and buy military hardware. READ MORE Spanish football's decline Don't blame Delta, blame people Stork gets a new 3D-printed leg Von der Leyen said the EU should be able to intervene militarily without the help of the U.S. but has lacked the political will to do so. ""You can have the most advanced forces in the world but if you are never prepared to use them, of what use are they? What has held us back until now is not just a shortfall of capacity, it is the lack of political will. And if we develop this political will, there is a lot that we can do at EU level,"" she said. 'Stop a pandemic of the unvaccinated' Before the Afghanistan crisis broke out in August, European leaders spent much of the past year-and-a-half entirely focused on the pandemic. Von der Leyen hailed Europe's roll-out of vaccines in 2021 and announced the bloc will donate 200 million doses to other countries, on top of the 250 million already promised. She also called on Europe to invest in preparing for the next pandemic. ""Let's do everything possible [so] that this does not turn into a pandemic of the unvaccinated,"" she urged.

03:45

Economic recovery While the coronavirus paralyzed economies all over Europe in 2020, Von der Leyen said 19 of the EU's economies should return to pre-pandemic levels this year. The rest, she says, will do so in 2022. She also focused heavily on the growing crisis around the production of semiconductors or microchips, stating they ""make everything work."" With an ongoing global shortage, Von der Leyen called on Europe to boost its production of semiconductors and rely less on Asia.

'Closing the climate finance gap' This summer the commissioner's native Germany and Belgium were hit by devastating floods, while wildfires scorched across parts of Greece and Italy. Von der Leyen took the opportunity to explicitly link these extreme weather events to climate change. Looking ahead to the COP26 climate change conference in November, she said it will be ""a moment of truth for the global community."" She also called China's climate change goals ¨C such as reaching carbon neutrality by 2060 ¨C ""encouraging"" but added that major economies such as China and the U.S. need to set out how they will hit their targets. ""But we expect the United States and our partners to step up, too. This is vital, because closing the climate finance gap together, the U.S. and the European Union, would be such a strong signal for global climate leadership,"" she said. More assertive EU Calling on Europe to become a ""more active global player"" on the international stage, Von der Leyen announced a new initiative called the Global Gateway, which will drive investment in infrastructure projects around the world. This could be a competitor to China's Belt and Road Initiative, through which the country has invested in projects across Europe, Asia and Africa.

EU aims to 'stop pandemic of the unvaccinated': COVID-19 Bulletin,"TOP HEADLINES

? The pace of vaccination must be quickened across the globe to avert ""a pandemic of the non-vaccinated,"" the European Union's chief said on Wednesday in her annual policy speech.

Ursula von der Leyen's second State of the Union address since she took over as European Commission president comes after two years that have tested the resilience of the bloc with the COVID-19 pandemic, a sharp economic downturn and strains over Brexit.

""Let's make sure that it does not turn into a pandemic of the non-vaccinated,"" Von der Leyen told EU lawmakers in Strasbourg, France.

In an attempt to accelerate the rate of vaccinations around the world, Von der Leyen offered another 200 million jabs for non-EU countries.

? British inflation hit a more than nine-year high last month after the biggest monthly jump in the annual rate in at least 24 years. The rise has been largely attributed to a one-off boost reflecting the ""Eat Out to Help Out"" scheme that, in an attempt to boost customer numbers following the first lockdown, pushed down restaurant meal prices last year.

The sharper-than-expected rise in inflation will be evaluated by Bank of England policymakers, who are weighing up whether to call an early end to the stimulus plan launched at the height of the pandemic last year.

? Britain cancelled its contract earlier this week for about 100 million doses of a vaccine being developed by France's Valneva in part because it was clear it would not be approved for use in the country, UK Health Secretary Sajid Javid told parliament.

? The Dutch government on Tuesday announced it was easing COVID-19 restrictions and will introduce a ""corona"" pass showing proof of vaccination to go to bars, restaurants, clubs or cultural events. Prime Minister Mark Rutte said most social distancing requirements will be dropped from September 25.

? Turkey logged 27,802 new cases on Tuesday, the highest number of daily infections since May 4, health ministry data showed, as Health Minister Fahrettin Koca urged people to get vaccinated.

Turkey also recorded 276 deaths from the coronavirus on Tuesday, near record daily levels. The rise in Turkey's daily death toll since mid-July has been among the sharpest in countries across Europe and the Middle East, global data show.

? Africa wants to buy vaccines, rather than keep waiting for donor-funded doses to arrive, the African Union said Tuesday, imploring producers to give the continent a fair shot at market access.

The AU also urged manufacturing nations to lift export bans so the continent can begin to address for itself the glaring inequity in access to coronavirus jabs, as wealthy nations hoard available doses.

? U.S. army officers who refuse to be vaccinated could be suspended from their duties and possibly discharged, the force announced.

After the Food and Drug Administration fully approved the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine in August, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin had ordered that all active duty service members must get vaccinated.

The army said it had begun implementing this order in late August, adding that soldiers could request an exemption on legitimate medical, religious or administrative grounds.

? The UK on Tuesday set out its winter plan to tackle the coronavirus. Watch Paul Barber's report:"
"'No other option' but to engage with Taliban, says EU's top diplomat","The EU's High Representative for Foreign Affairs says the bloc has no other option but to engage with the Taliban following the fall of the Afghan government.

However, Josep Borrell also insisted that engagement ""doesn't mean recognition.""

The EU's top diplomat was addressing the European Parliament, which is sitting in Strasbourg this week, ahead of a debate on Afghanistan.

Insisting the ""Afghan crisis is not over,"" Borrell also said the EU is considering setting up a diplomatic presence in Kabul.

Western governments including the U.S. and the UK shuttered their embassies during the withdrawal of troops from the country last month."
UK sets out COVID-19 winter action plan amid rising cases and deaths,"UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has set out his government's plan for tackling COVID-19 over the winter months. It comes a day after medical leaders recommended vaccines for 12- to 15-year-olds and ahead of a roll-out of booster jabs for older people.

The leaves on London's trees are indicating signs of a change in season. And it isn't just the typical British drizzle dampening spirits as the UK heads into the fall.

With around 34,000 new COVID-19 infections a day, and 1,000 deaths in the past month, the British government's message is clear as it sets out its plans for what is anticipated to be a tough winter for the health service.

""COVID is still out there, the disease sadly still remains a risk,"" Johnson told reporters at a press conference, speaking just hours after it was confirmed that his 79-year-old mother Charlotte had died on Monday.

""I'm confident that we can keep going with our plan to turn jabs, jabs, jabs, into jobs, jobs, jobs and protect the gains that we've made together,"" he said.

Key points of the plan

- All adults aged over 50 and those working in the National Health Service and social care will be offered a booster

- Anyone aged over 70 or deemed to be ""at risk"" will be prioritized

- Only mRNA vaccines produced by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna will be offered

- PCR tests for holidaymakers will be scrapped

Announcing the blueprint in front of lawmakers in parliament, Health Secretary Sajid Javid said: ""The plan before the house today is our Plan A, a comprehensive plan to steer this country through the autumn and winter. But we've seen how quickly this virus can adapt and change.""

With children now back in classrooms for the new school year, and the delights of summer's al-fresco dining already fading, variants of the virus ¨C Delta or otherwise ¨C will continue spreading.

But with new data showing the vaccines' solid success at preventing death and severe illness ¨C they are at the center of Westminster's plan to roll back emergency restrictions and avoid further lockdowns."

Initially 100 products from each side were given mutual protection, ensuring that only those made according to traditional methods could use the name. From the Chinese side, products such as Puer tea and Pixian bean paste made the list. While French wines, Italian ham and German beer all feature on the European side. The plan is to increase the number of beneficiaries over time and the agreement could also be expanded to cover non-consumable items such as handicrafts."

Dutch authorities released a British Formula 1 fan after he was mistakenly arrested on suspicion of being a notorious Sicilian mafia boss.

The man, only identified by his lawyer as Mark L., 54, from Liverpool, was cuffed and blindfolded last Wednesday when heavily armed police stormed a restaurant in The Hague, shocking onlookers.

The arrest came after Italy issued an international arrest warrant, believing the man was Matteo Messina Denaro, a leading figure in the Sicilian crime gang known as ""Cosa Nostra,"" who has been on the run since 1993.

""The man arrested earlier this week in a Hague restaurant is not the man sought by Italian authorities,"" the Dutch public prosecutor's office admitted. ""He has been freed immediately.""

His lawyer, Leon van Kleef, told AFP there were suspicions of a mix-up from the start. ""My client told me he was from Spain, where he now lives and was here for the Formula 1 race last weekend in Zandvoort,"" Van Kleef said.

""I had a strong hunch to believe him,"" he added.

'Like a bad movie'

After his arrest Mark L. was taken to Vught maximum security prison, where some of the country's most notorious criminals are held, according to news reports. Prosecutors said Mark L. was being held while his identity was checked by Italian authorities.

""It's like a bad movie, a nightmare that my client has found himself in,"" Van Kleef said.

Although the Italian arrest warrant was still in effect, quashing it now was a ""mere formality,"" he added. Asked whether his client would seek compensation, Van Kleef said: ""We will look into it.""

The Dutch public prosecutor's office said the arrest was carried out at the request of the Italian authorities.

""If they say 'arrest this person,' we arrest that person. That's the mutual agreement we have with them,"" an official told the NOS public broadcaster.

'Diabolik' remains at large

Cosa Nostra crime family boss Matteo Messina Denaro, 59, is one of the EU law enforcement agency Europol's most wanted criminals and is known by his nickname ""Diabolik.""

He is suspected of being involved in a spate of bombings including the infamous assassinations of top anti-Mafia prosecutors Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino.

Denaro was sentenced in absentia in 2002 to life in jail for his role in the 1993 bombings."
Why tennis star Emma Raducanu is on course to earn $100m,"04:09

Emma Raducanu's astounding triumph at the U.S. Open as the first British woman in 44 years to win a Grand Slam and the youngest British tennis player to reach the U.S. Open final has won global recognition and now the 18-year-old star is now on course to make millions, if her sports career continues on this trajectory.

Born in Toronto, Canada to a Romanian father and Chinese mother, Raducanu moved to the UK when she was only two, and built her tennis career there. Her rise from 345th in the world before her debut at Wimbledon in July to winning the U.S. Open last week has already made her something of a legend in tennis and as a high-profile athlete, Raducanu stands to attract millions in sponsorship deals.

As the U.S. Open champion, Raducanu won a cash prize of $2.5 million, but brand experts say she could rake in many millions more through sponsorship as her career continues.

Simon Chadwick, professor of Eurasian Sport at Emlyon Business School in France, says the young tennis star is the dream client for the world's biggest brands. ""She is quintessentially Generation Z: mixed heritage, social media savvy, somebody who has got personality. And I think it's the personality that in particular is interesting because all successful brands are distinctive and differentiated from other brands,"" Chadwick explained. ""By virtue of the fact that she speaks more than one language, she belongs in lots of different places, she speaks very well, she looks good, and clearly she has a lot to say ¨C and the way she says this in a very accomplished fashion ¨C really marks her as being different from many of her peers.""

Brands that aim to engage younger target audiences and non-conventional brands that are not currently involved in sports, might choose Raducanu as the perfect sponsor. Her Chinese heritage, according to Chadwick, might also attract big sponsors from the country such as Alibaba and Tencent. In 2020 the top 10 highest-paid female athletes were all tennis players, with some of the sport's household names such as Maria Sharapova and Venus Williams making more money from endorsements, speaking engagements and YouTube channels than they did in prize money. Raducanu could follow in the footsteps of 2018 US Open champion Naomi Osaka who, despite being 22 years old, was the highest-paid female player in the sport last year and is on course to be one of the elite few whose career earnings could top $100 million. ""For somebody like Raducanu, if they can sustain longevity over a decade and win consistently and continue to embody the kinds of values that sponsors want to align with, then you can conceivably see $100 million or more,"" said Chadwick. ""But it is really, really difficult, I think, for tennis players to break through that barrier. And I think it's especially difficult for female tennis players to break through that $100m barrier."""
Vatican's Swiss Guard prepares for future with female soldiers,"The tunics worn by the Swiss Guard are tailored in the colors of the Medici family, who provided four popes and were also patrons of Renaissance artists Michelangelo and Leonardo Da Vinci. /Independent Picture Service/UIG via Getty Images The tunics worn by the Swiss Guard are tailored in the colors of the Medici family, who provided four popes and were also patrons of Renaissance artists Michelangelo and Leonardo Da Vinci. /Independent Picture Service/UIG via Getty Images

The world's smallest army, as the Vatican's Swiss Guard is also known, is building new barracks for its elite troops ¨C and for the first time it will include facilities for women.

Swiss Guards have been responsible for the safety of the Pope of the Roman Catholic Church since the 16th century, a record that makes them the oldest military unit in continuous operation in history. Their iconic costumes ¨C blue berets and doublets, white ruffs, plumed helmets and red, yellow and blue tunics ¨C have a stunning Renaissance flavor.

The traditional rules of recruitment to their ranks are just as old-fashioned: new recruits must be unmarried men with Swiss citizenship, between 19 and 30 years old and at least 1.74 meters tall. In such a conservative institution, there's no provision for female roles... or there wasn't until now. The new barracks in the Vatican are being designed to accommodate female Swiss Guards ¨C revolutionary news that comes before the recruitment of women into the Swiss Guard is even officially allowed.

New recruits must serve for a minimum of two years. /Independent Picture Service/UIG via Getty Images New recruits must serve for a minimum of two years. /Independent Picture Service/UIG via Getty Images

""We planned a new building covering the long-term needs of the Guard,"" explained Jean-Pierre Roth, chairman of the Swiss foundation funding the construction of the new barracks. ""In many countries, females are integrated in the army or the police. It could also come one day in the Vatican. As careful planners, we had to think about it.""

Opening the ranks to women will also help the elite corps to maintain its numbers. Every year, the Swiss Guard recruits 30 to 35 people. There are currently 135 Swiss Guards, most of whom sleep in communal barracks, while the married ones live with their families in separate apartments outside the Vatican. The new facilities, promise to bring ""more space, single rooms, apartments for the families, better quality of the building (humidity, heating) and eco-friendly construction,"" according to Roth. Lieutenant Urs Breitenmoser, spokesperson for the Swiss Guard, said: ""The primary aim is to build safe and modern new buildings with enough space and privacy for the 135 Swiss Guards, as well as additional apartments for the families who live outside the Vatican walls.""

The project, costing $54.49 million, is due to be completed by 2026. Whether women will be allowed to join the elite corps by then will depend on ratification from the Pope.

A Vatican spokesman traveling with the Pope Francis in Hungary and Slovakia told Reuters that when a papal source was asked about allowing women into the Swiss Guard, they said ""We'll see.""

"U.S. coronavirus failures are abuse of human rights, UN hears","The U.S.'s mishandling of the coronavirus pandemic represents a human rights abuse committed against its own people, a United Nations meeting has heard. Speaking on behalf of a group of countries, Jiang Duan, a minister from the Chinese mission to the UN in Geneva, told a meeting of the organization's Human Rights Council that Washington had infringed on the people's rights to health and life in favor of playing a political blame game.

The U.S. has suggested the COVID-19 pandemic may have been sparked by a leak from a Chinese laboratory. The claim has been dismissed by China and found to be ""extremely unlikely"" by World Health Organization investigators. ""Instead of fighting the virus in full gear, the U.S. government is obsessed in political manipulation of issues like virus origin-tracing, with the purpose of shifting blame to other countries and shirking responsibility for its own failure,"" Jiang said, according to a transcript of his remarks. He also said unilateral U.S. actions have prevented other nations from accessing vaccines and medicines to tackle the virus. More than 660,000 Americans have died with COVID-19, according to figures from Johns Hopkins University ¨C more fatalities than in any other nation.

China's Ambassador to the UN Office in Geneva Chen Xu made a separate, broader statement calling for universal security and peace. The speech highlighted five points to protect human rights in an ever-changing environment. They included upholding the UN systems, bridging conflict through political dialogue, promoting sustainable development, mutual learning and focusing on non-traditional security threats. Chen told the session: ""We should pay more attention to non-traditional security threats, including public health, terrorism and climate change, take a holistic approach, and address both the crisis and its root causes. ""We call on all countries to join hands to safeguard world peace and security and work together for the full enjoyment of human rights for all in a world of lasting peace and universal security.""

The statements from China's representatives on human rights come a day after the chief of the UN's Human Rights Council said her office was finalizing its assessment of the available information on allegations of serious human rights violations against Muslim Uygurs in the Xinjiang region, noting efforts to gain access to the area had been unsuccessful. Debates as part of the 48th session of the UN Human Rights Council will continue for the next few weeks, covering a range of issues from the rights of children to climate change impacts and human rights abuses in conflict zones.

Greek olive farmers count the cost of recent wildfires,"""It would take at least 10 years for the trees that have been completely burned to grow back. For the trees that are partially burned, it would take five years. Five hundred thousand olive trees have been destroyed. The damage is just too big, especially if you take into account that many businesses rely on them,"" says Lattas.

Local farmer and forest ranger Panagiotis Lattas has returned to his farm to see what is left and record the damage.

The combination of a prolonged drought ¨C the complete absence of rain for the past three months ¨C and the wildfires near Ancient Olympia have dried out the soil and deprived the olive trees of any water source and the growers of a substantial crop.

In the first week of August, Greece faced its most severe heatwave in 30 years ¨C with temperatures soaring to around 45 degrees Celsius for several days in a row.

The island of Evia has been handed 40m euros ($47m) to aid rebuilding infrastructure after fires devastated the olive farms. Farmers in other parts of Greece are asking for similar funds to be made available to them. /Petros Karadjias/AP

The island of Evia has been handed 40m euros ($47m) to aid rebuilding infrastructure after fires devastated the olive farms. Farmers in other parts of Greece are asking for similar funds to be made available to them. /Petros Karadjias/AP

At its peak earlier this month, authorities were called out to more than 100 wildfires a day as the country experienced its worst heatwave in decades.

From Evia to Athens and in the Peloponnese region, thousands were evacuated, hundreds of homes were lost, while pine forests and olive trees were destroyed.

In an area known for its olive production, many make their living from the land, relying on the trees as their main source of income.

""Olive oil is a big part of our finances. But besides being our main source of income, it is part of our everyday life and part of our culture. When you take a closer look at the damage done, besides the environmental impact and the impact on the wildlife, it mostly affects us, the locals,"" says Lattas.

On returning to their farms, locals discovered the true extent of the devastation the wildfires had reaped. Trees were burned to the ground, vegetation had been erased and crops completely destroyed. Decades of hard work had been devoured in just a few hours, leaving the once green countryside looking like a warzone.

Now the battle against the flames has ended, locals face a new fight ¨C this time, it is with the government over compensation.

""We are asking the government to apply a special program to our region, Ancient Olympia, as they did in north Evia. Through those programs, the government should find a way to increase grants and funding to those affected by the fires. Whether that's from government organizations, the central bank of the country or even loans from the European Union's investment bank,"" says the mayor of Ancient Olympia, Georgios Georgiopoulos.

There are currently no active fires in Greece and most of the foreign firefighters have returned home. The Greek government announced a 500 million euros ($590.4 million) relief fund and compensation for people who have lost homes and properties.

Locals like Lattas hope the olive branch handed from the authorities will not fall or burn like their farms."
"Vladimir Putin isolates, UK's winter booster plan: COVID-19 Bulletin","TOP HEADLINES

? Russia's President Vladimir Putin is self-isolating after cases were detected in his inner circle, the Kremlin said, as the country struggles with consistently high infection rates. ""The president is absolutely healthy,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters, adding that the Russian leader had taken a coronavirus test, without specifying the result.

? UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced the start of a booster jab program, as vaccine experts confirmed some of the key parts of a winter plan including:

- All adults aged over 50 and those working in the National Health Service and social care will be offered a booster

- Anyone aged over 70 or deemed to be ""at risk"" will be prioritized

- Only mRNA vaccines produced by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna will be offered

- PCR tests for holidaymakers will be scrapped

The announcement comes after government scientists approved vaccinations for schoolchildren aged 12-15, setting out a widespread vaccine program before what ministers fear will be a difficult second winter coping with the virus.

? Tuesday is the final day for healthcare workers in France to get vaccinated. Obligatory vaccines for doctors and nurses were brought in at the start of summer and from today, healthcare workers can have pay docked or be refused entry to their workplace if they do not get vaccinated. France's powerful CGT union opposes the compulsory vaccine rules and is organizing marches today.

? New local infections more than doubled in China's southeastern province of Fujian, health authorities said on Tuesday, prompting officials to quickly introduce measures including travel restrictions to halt the spread of the virus.

? About one in 10 children in Israel had symptoms that remained after recovering from COVID-19, though that number dropped by more than half as the months passed, an Israeli Health Ministry survey showed. In June, the ministry carried out a phone survey among 13,834 parents of children aged 3-18 who had recovered from COVID-19, asking if they had lingering symptoms, including breathing issues, lethargy, and loss of smell and taste. The survey showed 11.2 percent of children had some symptoms after recovery. The figure declined to between 1.8 and 4.6 percent at six months from acute disease, with older children suffering more.

? The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has warned against travel to Afghanistan, Albania, Serbia, Belize, Lithuania and four other destinations because of COVID-19 concerns. The CDC raised its travel advisory to ""Level 4: Very High"" for nine destinations, telling Americans they should avoid travel to the locations. The destinations also include Grenada, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Slovenia and Mauritius.

? Miscarriages do not occur more often in pregnant women who receive an mRNA vaccine, according to a new study. Researchers analyzed data from eight U.S. health systems on 105,446 women who were between six and 19 weeks into their pregnancies. Overall, 12.4 percent of women suffered miscarriages, but the risk within a month after vaccination was no different from that for those who did not get vaccinated, according to a report published on Wednesday in The Journal of the American Medical Association.

? The Ukrainian government has decided to introduce COVID-19 ""vaccine passports"" verifying citizens' vaccination status, the health ministry said on Monday. The passports will allow businesses such as cinemas, gyms, theaters and swimming pools to operate without social distancing requirements if all visitors and at least 80 percent of staff at the venues are at least partially vaccinated."
"Balloon suspected of cutting off power to 300,000 homes in Dresden","Police are investigating whether the incident may have been caused deliberately, according to the utility company Sachsen Energie.

More than 300,000 households in the German city of Dresden lost power after a balloon apparently floated onto one of the city's substations.

The company said the remains of a charred balloon at the scene suggest a short circuit was caused by its metal coating.

That left hundreds of thousands without power shortly before 2 p.m. local time on Monday. The substation was brought back online two hours later.

Local media reported that emergency services were called out dozens of times during the period, many times due to people who had become trapped in elevators."

""I believe it's worth attempting to form a majority government,"" Store told reporters after votes were counted late on Monday.

Store's goal is to convince both the rural-based Center Party and the mostly urban Socialist Left Party to join him, which would give his cabinet 89 seats, four more than what is needed for a majority in the 169-seat assembly.

Labor Party leader Jonas Gahr Store must address voters' concerns over global warming and a widening wealth gap, while ensuring any transition away from oil production ¨C and the jobs it creates ¨C is gradual.

Norway's center-left opposition parties will start coalition talks on Tuesday to try to form a majority government after winning a decisive parliamentary election victory, with climate change expected to be central to discussions.

Climate issues take center stage

Almost 40 percent of Norway's annual exports are from the oil industry so there will be pressure on a new government to carefully orchestrate any decline in production ¨C even if it impacts the country's climate change commitments, according to Jorgan Bolstad, associate professor at the University of Oslo.

""The main issue here is that there are so many jobs still in the oil sector, so that if you scale back quickly there is fear that the workers currently in that sector will need to find new jobs,"" Bolstad told CGTN Europe's Global Business program.

Store must persuade the other coalition parties to compromise on where to let oil firms explore for hydrocarbons while also cutting Norway's climate emissions in line with the Paris Agreement.

""The likely compromise has to do with restricting exploration, and the less explored and matured areas are easier to stop exploration in,"" said Baard Lahn, a researcher at Oslo-based climate think tank CICERO.

Norway produces around 4 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, accounting for a large share of the countries $1.4 trillion soverign wealth fund.

But most major parties also believe oil will play a smaller part over time, and hope the engineering know-how of oil firms can be transferred to renewable energy, including offshore wind.

""I think that the new coalition will increase the work on the climate issue, as both the IEA (International Energy Agency) and IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) report underlined the sense of emergency the world is facing, stating a code red,"" Thina Margrethe Saltvedt, Nordea Bank's chief analyst for sustainable finance told Reuters.

Conservative Prime Minister Erna Solberg said she would step down as soon as a new government is ready, with a cabinet headed by Store potentially taking office in mid-October."
One-third of families with young children 'live in poverty in UK',"A report by the Nuffield Foundation found that 36 percent of families with a young child were living on well below the average income after housing costs last year, up from 30 percent in 2014. Among larger families the problem was even greater, and worsening more rapidly, the analysis concluded.

Poverty is on the rise among families in the UK, with a third of households with a child aged under five affected, research has shown.

The report found families were at greater risk of poverty if:

¡¤ They were from an ethnic minority background

¡¤ They or their parents were disabled

¡¤ They lived in the northeast of England or London

The figures mean that around 2.2 million children are living in relative poverty ¨C defined as lower than 60 percent of the median income. This can result in a negative impact on emotional, physical and cognitive development, according to the report's authors.

The study, based on an analysis of 100 pieces of research, found a range of factors had contributed to the worsening situation, including rising housing costs, less secure employment and reductions in government support.

CGTN is examining the issue of global poverty ¨C and the solutions to eradicating it ¨C in our series Innovation, Action, Change. Sign up to find out more on our Facebook page."
Why eradicating moderate poverty could accelerate climate change,"A worker assists customers as they inspect smartphone handsets at a telecoms store in Maiduguri, Nigeria. /Jean Chung/Getty Images A worker assists customers as they inspect smartphone handsets at a telecoms store in Maiduguri, Nigeria. /Jean Chung/Getty Images

No country has eradicated poverty; all countries still have work to do. The UN goal to eradicate extreme poverty is vital, while each country's domestic policies to tackle extreme poverty are important for stability ¨C but what of those living in moderate poverty? What makes these people worthy of our interest? Firstly, their sheer number ¨C while 10 percent of the world's population live in extreme poverty, 85 percent live in moderate poverty. And that scale can be hard to comprehend. The chart below ¨C a recreation of a data visualization by Max Roser, founder of Our World in Data ¨C might help. It shows the average income in countries around the world. Each bar is a country; its height represents the average daily income there, its width represents the country's population size.

Firstly, this is a stark display of how low many people's incomes are, with 50 percent of the planet are still living on less than $10 a day. Most people still live on less per day than the poverty threshold of rich nations (around $25-$35). Low incomes usually translate to low standards of living, higher mortality rates ¨C and a thirst for rapid economic growth. This puts economic growth and the increase in average income at the forefront of many governments' minds ¨C at a time when climate chaos is tolling the bell for classic economic theory. Around the world, drought, fires, floods, rising sea levels and hurricanes are not just costing billions of dollars in damages but forcing everyone to think differently about how economies work. Put simply: If climate chaos is a direct consequence of carbon emissions, and carbon emissions are a direct consequence of consumption and economic growth, then raising much of the world out of poverty could vastly worsen climate chaos ¨C if humankind continues on its current path.

It's a looming problem well known to Achim Steiner, administrator of the United Nations Development Program. ""We have an extractive economic paradigm that looks at nature as something that you basically draw down in order to build up an industrialized economy,"" Steiner tells CGTN Europe. ""Now, in our age, that equation doesn't work, and that is why the world is bound together in responding to these multiple challenges."" Steiner accepts the way that we structure our economies must change if we are to tackle climate change. Africa is looking at contributing between one and two billion eager consumers by 2050. ""Imagine adding another billion people to the current grid as electricity consumers using fossil fuels,"" he says. ""There is no way that we would succeed in achieving the kinds of targets that the Paris agreement set out."" So what does this mean for 50 percent of the world's population, most of whom have just escaped extreme poverty and are looking forward to the promises of an OECD nation lifestyle? The result could spell disaster for the planet. What can be done to convince these crucial people to change their behavior and alter their ideas of prosperity and progress? Will they listen when richer nations are doing so little to address carbon emissions themselves?

COVID-19 probably didn't originate in Wuhan ¨C top global geneticist,"Forster added that the variants of COVID-19 responsible for the vast scale of the global pandemic, including Delta and Beta, can be traced back to a mutation that occurred in north Italy.

So far, the pandemic has infected 219 million people globally and killed more than 4.5 million.

Peter Forster, geneticist and vice president of the Cambridge Society for the Application of Research at Cambridge University, also told an online lecture the idea that COVID-19 originated in a Wuhan seafood market is a ""red herring.""

COVID-19 probably did not originate in Wuhan, according to a leading geneticist who has reconstructed the ""evolutionary path"" of the virus .

Forster's team studied the original database of 160 viral genomes taken from the first batch of COVID-19 patients between December 2019 and March 2020. In doing so, they were able to identify the oldest virus, which they labeled ""A type.""

This was not exactly the same virus first identified in Wuhan, suggesting it had emerged elsewhere and mutated before arriving in the city.

He explained: ""We assumed, like everyone else, that the virus had emerged initially in Wuhan but it was surprising that we didn't have the ancestral A type [there] but the derived B type predominantly.""

Having plotted the virus genomes in the pre-January 16, 2020 data, Forster said: ""If I ask you where these types are most common and where, therefore, is the probable area of origin, you would probably say, well, perhaps somewhere in China, South East Asia, but definitely not in Hubei Province or Wuhan.""

Only one of 29 genomes recorded in Wuhan was from the A type, and that was not found until January 5 ¨C well after the beginning of the outbreak. Elsewhere in China and in Nepal, from 12 coronavirus genomes, six were A types.

""So this doesn't really look as if Wuhan or Hubei Province are good candidates for the origin of the spread,"" Forster said.

Origin debate

A World Health Organization (WHO) investigation into the origins of the virus is ongoing. The fact the virus was first identified in Wuhan, and therefore assumed to have originated in the city, had led to speculation that it may have leaked from a laboratory located there.

China has always denied this, but the WHO, backed by the U.S., said in July further investigation was needed."
Spain's La Liga: A soccer league in decline?,"A day 560 days in the making, Real Madrid is back at the Bernabeu stadium playing in front of 30,000 jubilant fans.

Sunday's La Liga clash against Celta Vigo was the club's first game at the newly refurbished ground since March 1 last year, when the team beat rival Barcelona 2-0 in El Clasico.

""I'm very happy, especially as it's the first time I have actually been to the stadium and I am really excited about it to be honest,"" one supporter told CGTN Europe.

La Liga's financial crisis

Amid all the euphoria of the fans returning and watching Real Madrid live at the newly renovated stadium, things aren't quite so rosy in the La Liga garden.

The financial impact of the pandemic alongside some questionable decisions in the transfer market by several Spanish clubs means Spain's top league may not be the financial powerhouse it once was.

""It's true that after Cristiano [Ronaldo] and [Lionel] Messi left ¨C the La Liga level is not as high now,"" another fan said. ""We need to sign big stars like [Kylian] Mbappe or [Erling] Haaland to make it stronger.""

This summer, Real Madrid had failed to sign French World Cup winner Mbappe, an ominous sign to many of the club's fading power.

Pandemic's impact

A decline in ticket sales and reduced sponsorship deals as a result of the pandemic has left the team more than $1 billion in debt.

The situation is even worse at Spain's other superclub Barcelona. Now $1.6 billion in the red, the club has been forced to sell its star player Messi to French club Paris Saint Germain.

With the financial situation so dire, it was perhaps no surprise that Real and Barcelona were the most vocal supporters of the doomed European Super League (ESL).

Juan Castro, a journalist at Spain's Marca newspaper, explained the ESL would have perhaps provided an immediate financial solution, but to the detriment of the sport.

""The Super League could be a solution for three or four clubs ¨C let's say Real Madrid and Barca in Spain, and then a great solution for clubs like PSG, Man City, or Chelsea. But it could also mean the death of football,"" he said.

""In the medium to long term, it could also be the death for Real and Barca, since they depend on signing players from the small and medium-sized teams,"" he added.

Many experts agree that even with the huge problems La Liga is currently facing, the signing of superstar Mbappe could make the difference.

If he chooses a Spanish club next season, it would go some way to restoring some much-needed prestige to the struggling soccer league."
Deadly wildfire rages for sixth day in Costa Del Sol,"Firefighters continued to battle wildfires for a sixth day near a Costa del Sol resort in southern Spain, but officials said signs were hopeful as some evacuees from the area started to return home.

""The evolution over the last few hours shows hopeful signs but we have to remain prudent,"" fire brigade chief Juan Sanchez of the regional forest fire agency told reporters on Monday.

Backed by some 50 aircraft, about 1,000 firefighters have been working to put out the blaze, which has already devastated 7,780 hectares of forest since it started on Wednesday.

Officials said the wildfire has been one of the most difficult to tackle in recent times in Spain.

The authorities have allowed 1,054 people who were evacuated from the resort of Estepona and the town of Benahavis last week to return home. However, several hundred more from other nearby areas are still waiting for the green light, with hopes raised by some light rain on Monday.

""We have been talking for a long time about the consequences of rural area depopulation, climate change and other phenomena. Today we are experiencing them,"" Sanchez said.

Propelled by strong winds, the wildfire started on Wednesday evening in the mountainous Sierra Bermeja area above Estepona, a popular tourist spot for visiting Britons.

A firefighter died on Thursday while tackling the blaze.

Regional environment chief Carmen Crespo said on Friday the fire appeared to have been started on purpose and investigators were working to find out more information."
Is Delta more transmissible ¨C or is it just human behavior?,"09:21

The Delta variant's spread led to a surge in COVID-19 cases as countries including the UK, the U.S. and India relaxed restrictions. But is that because it is more transmissible than other variants - or is it more to do with human behavior? U.S. virologist Vincent Racaniello tells RAZOR the latter is far more important in shaping the course of the pandemic than any variant. Now he and his colleagues are concerned that misunderstanding about new variants ¨C particularly the assumption that they pose a unique or substantial risk compared with earlier variants ¨C is causing confusion, panic and, in some cases, a reluctance to get vaccinated.

'The human factor' The crux of the issue is what the Columbia University professor calls the misguided impression that because the Delta variant spread so quickly, it must also be more infectious or more dangerous. He says people are forgetting about ""the human factor."" Pointing to the devastating impact of the variant on India, Racaniello explains that after months of lockdown and low caseloads, the government suddenly lifted many restrictions.

This coincided with devout Hindus from around the country gathering in a small Himalayan town to participate in the Kumbh Mela festival, one of the world's largest gatherings of humans. With cases on the rise already in India, it became a super-spreader event. ""The apparent spread and domination of a new variant makes many people say, 'yeah, it must be more transmissible,' but it's not,"" says the professor. ""It's simply in the right place at the right time and it's outcompeting the former variant. It's a little bit more fit, so Delta is so far the fittest of all of them,"" he adds. READ MORE: COVID-19 vaccines strong against Delta, protection wanes in older adults

Transmission vs 'fitness' Racaniello uses the word ""fitness"" to describe a virus's biological ability to reproduce and spread purely in the evolutionary sense. This could mean how easily it replicates in the body, evades the immune system, or even how long it can stay in your nasal passages. However, transmission means the spread of a virus from one person to another person. The difference is transmission, unlike fitness, can be hugely influenced by human behavior. ""If 10 people are in a room with one infected person, all of those 10 people may be infected, but that doesn't change the intrinsic transmissibility of the virus,"" says the professor.

He adds: ""All of the proclamations about transmissibility are made because we see variants suddenly emerging and then dominating and spreading through the population, but that's not necessarily a better-transmitting virus ¨C we think it's most of the time because people's behavior has changed."" Outbreaks then occur wherever the virus is present, according to the scientist, and that becomes the virus that will spread in the outbreak. ""Transmission is not the right word for that,"" says Racaniello. ""In virology terms, transmission is the virus itself, but an epidemiologist just views it as the spread of a virus in a population. And that's been the problem."" READ MORE: Delta does not cause more severe symptoms in children, study suggests

Racaniello says we shouldn't panic about the effect of new variants of vaccine efficacy. /CGTN Europe Racaniello says we shouldn't panic about the effect of new variants of vaccine efficacy. /CGTN Europe

So should we be concerned about new variants? The professor still wants people to take the virus seriously, but he doesn't want to see misunderstandings, creating unnecessary panic. ""Every year or two, a new influenza virus variant emerges. It spreads throughout the world and we have to change the vaccine to accommodate it,"" he says. ""If you notice, no-one ever calls the new influenza virus variant more transmissible because it's not. It's simply more fit and it displaces the previous influenza virus variant, and this is exactly what is happening with Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, SARS-coV-2 variants."" Still, concerns remain over new mutations, particularly the impact of new variants on vaccine efficacy. But Racaniello is confident the vaccines will stave off severe symptoms for a while to come.

The solutions to reduce the impact of variants are the same interventions that prevent infection, says Racaniello. /CGTN Europe The solutions to reduce the impact of variants are the same interventions that prevent infection, says Racaniello. /CGTN Europe"

A Dutch court has ruled that Uber drivers in the Netherlands are employees and entitled to more workers' rights. /Mike Blake/Reuters

Uber drivers in the Netherlands are employees and therefore entitled to more workers' rights under national labor laws, a Dutch court has ruled, landing another blow on the U.S. company¡¯s operations in Europe.

Another victory for European unions demanding better pay and benefits for those working in the gig economy, the ruling follows a similar court decision on Uber made earlier this year in the UK.

The Federation of Dutch Trade Unions had argued the company's roughly 4,000 drivers in Amsterdam were in fact employees of a taxi business and should be granted equivalent benefits to those working in the taxi sector.

Uber said it ""has no plans to employ drivers in the Netherlands"" and would appeal against the decision.

""We are disappointed with this decision because we know that the overwhelming majority of drivers wish to remain independent,"" said Maurits Schoenfeld, Uber's general manager for northern Europe. ""Drivers don¡¯t want to give up their freedom to choose if, when and where to work.""

The court ruled that drivers who pick up passengers via the Uber app should be covered by the collective labor agreement for taxi transportation.

""The legal relationship between Uber and these drivers meets all the characteristics of an employment contract,"" the ruling said.

The FNV celebrated the ruling. ""Due to the judge's ruling, the Uber drivers are now automatically employed by Uber,"" deputy chair Zakaria Boufangacha said. ""As a result, they will receive more wages and more rights in the event of dismissal or illness, for example.""

Uber drivers will also in some cases be entitled to back pay, the court said.

The judges also gave Uber a fine of 50,000 euros ($58,940) for failing to implement the terms of the labor agreement for taxi drivers.

In March, Uber said it would improve workers' rights, including by meeting the minimum wage in the UK, for all of its more than 70,000 British drivers after it lost a Supreme Court case in February."
"UN chief warns Afghanistan in 'most perilous hour,' appeals for $600m","UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres warned of a dire and looming humanitarian crisis on Monday as he appealed for hundreds of millions in aid. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres warned of a dire and looming humanitarian crisis on Monday as he appealed for hundreds of millions in aid.

The United Nations on Monday warned that Afghanistan is on the precipice of a major humanitarian crisis and appealed for more than $600 million in fresh aid to help millions of people on the ground. In his opening remarks, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the country faced a ""looming catastrophe"" and that many Afghans were in ""perhaps their most perilous hour"" after the Taliban took over in August. READ MORE China's first COVID-19 vaccine factory in Europe Auto show focuses on electric future Tennis's new British-Chinese-Romanian star ""Today, one in three Afghans do not know where their next meal will come from, the poverty rate is spiraling and basic public services are close to collapse. Hundreds of thousands of people have been forced to flee their homes and at the same time, Afghanistan faces a severe drought ¨C the second to hit the country in four years. Many people could run out of food by the end of this month just as winter approaches,"" he warned.

The UN's World Food Programme (WFP) said 14 million people were on the brink of starvation. About one-third of the money was earmarked for the WFP to bring vital supplies to the country over the next four months. Guterres said more than $1 billion in aid pledges were made, but it was ""impossible"" to say how much was specifically earmarked for the UN. The U.S. pledged $64 million in fresh funding, Austria $73m, while France said it would allocate $117m. ""Humanitarian aid will not solve the problem if the economy in Afghanistan collapses,"" Guterres added. ""My appeal is to find ways to allow for an injection of cash in the Afghan economy, allowing it to breathe and avoiding a collapse that would be devastating for the people of Afghanistan.""

Taliban 'breaking its promises' Even before the Taliban takeover last month, 18 million people ¨C or roughly half of the Afghan population ¨C depended on aid. The vast majority of them were children. The problem has become even more acute after billions in foreign funding that once flowed into Afghanistan's Western-backed government dried up. Countries including the U.S. and those in the EU said they will not even think of resuming such aid until the Taliban has proved itself tolerant. ""Safe passage of visa-holders must be permitted. There must be a cessation of violence and terrorism must not find a home in Afghanistan. Human rights must also be upheld, especially for women and children,"" said Australia's Foreign Minister Marise Payne."
France to begin administering third doses of COVID-19 vaccines,"Some 600,000 residents of care homes in France are set to be offered a third dose of a COVID-19 vaccine.

The government wants to roll out its booster-jab campaign despite the fact that the fourth wave of cases France suffered this summer due to the impact of the Delta variant has begun to subside.

Third doses were delivered to many retirement homes on September 10 ahead of the start of the third-shot program on September 13.

Ministers are urging the most vulnerable and those who were first-vaccinated at the start of the year to get the third jab.

The health minister advised that six months must have passed between the dates of the first injection and someone's planned third jab.

Vaccination slots are being made available for those aged 65 and above.

At a national level, 49.6 million people in France have had at least one vaccination, with a total of 46.7 million French citizens fully vaccinated.

Disparity between regions

Residents of nursing homes already have a high rate of full-vaccination.

Just over 90 percent have completed their vaccination cycle, according to data from Public Health France as of September 9.

However, strong disparities still exist between nursing homes in mainland France and in its overseas regions.

Some 95 percent of care home residents in the region of Haute-Marne are fully vaccinated.

By comparison, the French Caribbean islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique have only fully jabbed 52 percent and 53 percent of elderly residents.

The two islands have been hard hit by the fourth wave of cases, with France sending healthcare workers from the mainland and evacuating some patients to hospitals back in France as local medical facilities were overburdened.

For the islands, they are still focusing on rolling out first COVID-19 jabs to as many people as possible, with the third-shot booster campaign not a priority in those regions for now.

European power broker Angela Merkel prepares to step down,"As she steps down after 16 years as Germany's chancellor, Angela Merkel isn't just leaving a power vacuum at home ¨C she's also been a towering figure in the European Union, easily outlasting some of the bloc's other power brokers. In 2005, when Merkel was first elected in Germany, a website called YouTube was just launching, the term ""Brexit"" would have drawn blank looks in Brussels and the Greek economy was growing. Despite everything that has changed, though, the chancellor has been a constant presence through some of the European Union's biggest crises.

02:45

Early years In the first few years of her chancellorship, Merkel framed herself as hands-on, more interested in issues that affect citizens' day-to-day lives than machinations in Brussels. ""The citizens of Europe expect us to look after what is really important and not concern ourselves with ourselves for too long. That's why we will do everything to reach an agreement here. And then we can return to addressing the real problems: work, welfare, peace and security,"" Merkel told reporters in Brussels in June 2007, as EU leaders were negotiating what would become the Treaty of Lisbon.

One crisis after another Just a few years later, though, she would find herself at the heart of a crisis that threatened to undermine the entire European project. As the Greek economy teetered on the brink of collapse from 2010 onwards, Merkel helped marshal bail-outs from the EU and the International Monetary Fund. However, austerity measures imposed on Athens badly damaged her image, with cartoonists mocking her on the front pages of Greek newspapers. The migrant crisis in 2015 flipped her international image on its head. With her now famous remark, ""wir schaffen das"" or ""we can do this,"" she welcomed thousands of Syrian refugees into Germany. That infuriated right-wing leaders such as Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who accused Merkel of ""moral imperialism,"" or forcing Germany's border policy on the rest of the bloc.

German influence in Brussels The two front-runners to replace Merkel as chancellor later this month are Olaf Scholz of the SPD and Armin Laschet from Merkel's CDU party. Whoever her successor is, analysts in Brussels say they will have to focus on domestic politics early on.

A snap poll for ARD television taken soon after the 90-minute debate showed 41 percent of those asked thought Scholz was the most convincing performer, compared with 27 percent for Laschet and 25 percent for Baerbock.

"UK cancels vaccines contract, Germany's jabs drive: COVID-19 Bulletin","? French-Austrian biotech laboratory Valneva has revealed the UK government has terminated a supply deal for its candidate vaccine against COVID-19. Unlike most high-profile coronavirus shots, which prime the immune system to fight the coronavirus, Valneva's VLA2001 is based on an ""inactivated"" version of the coronavirus itself. The UK had ordered 100 million doses of the vaccine for 2021-22. It was the only order so far for Valvena, which has a production facility in Livingstone in Scotland. The UK authorities ""alleged that the company is in breach of its obligations under the Supply Agreement, but the company strenuously denies this,"" Valneva said in a statement.

The laboratory indicated at the end of August that on the basis of the Phase 1 and 2 trials, it hoped to have a vaccine that was more than 80 percent effective, with Phase 3 trial results available within weeks. Valneva said the UK government had the right in the contract to terminate the deal, but added: ""Valneva has worked tirelessly, and to its best efforts, on the collaboration with [the British government] including investing significant resources and effort to respond to [its] requests for variant-derived vaccines.""

Valneva said it hopes to get approval for its vaccine from UK health authorities by the end of 2021.

""Never was it simpler to get a vaccination. Never has it been quicker,"" Merkel said in her weekly podcast.

? Hundreds of thousands of people arriving in the UK as the Delta variant spread across the country may have ignored quarantine rules. Between March 17 and May 31 more than a million people arrived in the UK from amber list countries.

Domestic tourism boom breathes new life into UK seaside resorts,"The pandemic has led to an unexpected boom for the traditional British seaside holiday. /Paul Ellis/AFP The pandemic has led to an unexpected boom for the traditional British seaside holiday. /Paul Ellis/AFP

Up until very recently, there was a growing sense in England that the traditional seaside holiday ¨C characterized by bars of hard-rock candy, buckets and spades, and ice-cold dips ¨C would be firmly left in the 20th century. But with expensive COVID-19 tests, vaccine certification, quarantines and the UK government's ever-changing traffic-light system making overseas trips less attractive, there's been a boom in domestic tourism.

In the 19th and 20th centuries, city dwellers would arrive in droves to escape the urban bustle and enjoy the local entertainment. But from the 1960s onwards, affordable air travel and holidays started to draw more and more Britons overseas, cutting into Blackpool's once dominant tourism industry. By 2008, it offered 40 percent fewer bed spaces than in 1987, and Blackpool's reputation for leisure and pleasure would come to be replaced by one of abject poverty. A 2019 UK government study showed the town had eight of England's 10 most deprived neighborhoods.

Owen Wells, a 23-year-old welder, decided to go to Blackpool instead of the Spanish resort of Magaluf to celebrate his bachelor party. ""With COVID-19, it's been awkward ¨C a lot of my friends haven't been vaccinated,"" he said. ""It's where we can go where we don't have to isolate for two weeks."" Administrator Michelle Potter, 55, said she usually went to Spain, Turkey and Cyprus, but this year chose to take her nine-year-old daughter to Blackpool. ""I couldn't be bothered with the hassle of going abroad and having to stick to restrictions. The UK is just as good,"" she insisted.

Many locals are also celebrating the return of high tourist numbers, as surveys by Britain's tourism board continue to indicate that domestic holidaymakers have preferred traditional coastal towns this summer. Blackpool restaurant owner Alex Lonorgan, 37, has enjoyed two busy summers in a row following the first lockdown in March 2020. ""It's been amazing that so many families have had something different by having a UK holiday ¨C Blackpool is going to be back on everybody's map,"" he said.

Another local worker, 18-year-old Alfie Hayden, was happy to see business returning after the donut shop where he worked had to close on multiple occasions. Despite trade not reaching pre-pandemic heights, he's still optimistic. ""We were losing a lot of sales and it wasn't very good. It is what it is,"" he said. ""This is the best place to come for a quick getaway and it's brought up our sales a lot."" Blackpool Council leader Lynn Williams said recent regeneration work was also aiming to bring in private investment to encourage return visits from UK tourists who would usually holiday abroad. Blackpool ""has changed from when people came as a child and how it's portrayed. But we won't change in that we are a welcoming seaside resort,"" she added.

However, mass vaccination programs are already helping to tame the pandemic across Europe and North America, facilitating international travel, meaning the British seaside's revival could be a flash in the pan. But Williams thinks Blackpool's renaissance will be sustainable, as Britons rediscover attractions closer to home. ""The three piers and the tower ¨C no one else has that,"" she said. ""To see the tower lit up in all its glory is a lovely sight."" Lonorgan added: ""A lot of people come religiously to Blackpool every year ¨C that group has grown. ""That should have a knock-on effect. The positive side of a very difficult 18 months for Blackpool is that people have seen how good it is. Long may it continue.""

The human cost: UNICEF chief in Kabul on her hopes and fears,"08:27

WHAT'S THE ISSUE? Afghanistan is facing a major economic crisis and a humanitarian disaster. In the Panjshir valley, families lack food and medical supplies, and the Taliban are said to have cut internet and phone connections. Road checkpoints have also been installed. But it's not only the people of Panjshir who need assistance. Healthcare systems throughout are collapsing and the cost of food and other essentials is rising, with most banks remaining closed. Even prior to the Taliban takeover, more than 30 percent of the country was facing severe food insecurity. Aid and assistance provided by UN agencies has been hit by various challenges such as staff evacuations and legal uncertainties.

MEET THE EXPERT Sam Mort is UNICEF's chief of communication, advocacy and engagement. She was part of UNICEF's Changemaker 2020 programme and was involved in Afghanistan's first COVAX project, a global dose-sharing mechanism which ensures vaccines are distributed to where they are most needed. She has remained in Kabul following the Taliban takeover and withdrawal of U.S. troops.

WHAT DOES MORT SAY? Mort says it's vital that young women and girls retain their right to education. ""It is absolutely critical that all girls can go to school and university if they so choose,"" she says. ""Our representative has met the Education Commission of the Taliban¡­ there is a precedent here in the country around education."" Mort explains that the ongoing humanitarian problem was far from straightforward, even before the Taliban retook the country. ""It's a very complicated crisis here¡­ there are multiple challenges and they are interrelated. ""It's not just that schools are closed: Girls out of school are vulnerable to early marriage and child labour. It's not just that there's a measles outbreak: It's that Afghanistan is a polio-endemic country and we need to maintain a regular and rigorous program of polio vaccinations. It's not just that there are half a million people displaced from their homes ¨C and 60 percent of them are children: It's that over 550 children have been killed by violence ¨C the highest recorded figure since the UN began keeping records."" Despite the uncertainty of the Taliban's plans, Mort is confident they will find a way to safeguard young Afghans: ""We have a proven track record of navigating these challenging situations and supporting women and children and we hope very much that the international community and our donors will continue to support [us] at this critical time."""
Afghan diplomacy: Can there be collaboration with the Taliban?,"05:55

WHAT'S THE ISSUE? The world is slowly getting a better idea of the new Taliban administration. But even if Afghanistan's new leadership team is not entirely different from that of 20 years ago, there remains hope that we will see a different approach this time around ¨C the much-discussed Taliban 2.0. But just how likely is that? And just what can we expect in terms of diplomatic relations between the new Afghan leaders and the rest of the world? Adam Thomson, former UK permanent representative to NATO and former Foreign Office director of South Asia and Afghanistan, joins The Agenda with Stephen Cole to share his opinion.

MEET THE EXPERT Adam Thomson is now director of the European Leadership Network, following a long and distinguished diplomatic career. Between 2014 and 2016 he served as permanent representative to NATO after completing four years as the UK's high commissioner to Pakistan. Before that, he served as the UK Foreign Office's director for South Asia and Afghanistan between 2006 and 2009, and as deputy permanent representative to the United Nations with the rank of ambassador from 2002 to 2006.

WHAT DOES THOMSON SAY? Thomson sees a chance for a reasonable discourse between U.S. President Joe Biden, and Abdul Ghani Baradar and other Taliban leaders. ""There is a small possibility that the two sides will see it in their interests to compromise, to some extent to collaborate,"" he says. ""If they can find some uneasy truce, then the future looks a little more hopeful than a very isolated, defiant, truculent Afghanistan under pressure from Western sanctions."" Although nobody can know definitively how the Talban will govern, Thomson has reason to hope that things will be different this time around. ""I've watched them over the best part of 20 years, sitting, stewing, defeated for a while in Pakistan, seeking just one thing, which is to drive the foreigner out and return themselves to their own country,"" he says. ""It's possible that in that bitter experience, they have learned a few things."" Thomson notes that the Taliban may need to reach out for economic aid: ""They'd be crazy not to. The United States effectively has a block on IMF loans, World Bank funding, and holds, as I understand it, a large percentage of total Afghan cash reserves."" While warning that it takes both sides to compromise, Thomson insists ""there is scope for a very pragmatic, very clear-eyed, realistic collaboration with the Taliban by the international community that helps them to help the rest of us keep international terrorism out of Afghanistan, bear down on the drugs trade, and create the positive incentives for Afghans not to become a migrant flood."""
Election: Norway likely to shift more left and green,"02:45

On Monday, Norwegians will be called to the polls to elect a new parliament ¨C and most likely also a new prime minister. After eight years in office, the days of conservative Prime Minister Erna Solberg seem numbered, despite her internationally-praised COVID-19 policy. Yet the pandemic is not even a central election issue. Norway is rich in oil, and the increasing influence of small parties that want to ban additional oil exploration ¨C and reduce ties with the European Union ¨C could lead to significant economic changes in Western Europe's largest energy producer.

The social democratic party is dependent on the green party, which wants to close down the Norwegian oil and gas sector - Daniel Torkildsen, Head of Communication, H?yre conservative party

Daniel Torkildsen ¨C the 31-year-old head of communication of Erna Solberg's conservative party H?yre ¨C is not giving up. Speaking to CGTN at a public promotional stand, he's literally reaching out to the electorate. ""We try to have a lot of direct contact with voters, both via the stand, by knocking on doors, by calling people via cell phone,"" he says. And it seems to be working: more interested people crowd his booth than at any of his rival parties' stands. A young girl even hangs an Erna Solberg bag on her shoulder.

Tote bags featuring prime minister Erna Solberg may not be enough to keep her conservatives in power. /CGTN Tote bags featuring prime minister Erna Solberg may not be enough to keep her conservatives in power. /CGTN

The problem is not Solberg's poll ratings, but those of her coalition partners. Polls predict a victory for the Labour party and its leftist allies. Torkildsen feels such a green welfare coalition could be a danger to Norway's most important industrial sector. ""The social democratic party is dependent on the green party, which wants to close down the Norwegian oil and gas sector ¨C a very radical policy,"" he says, ""and I think that actually will mobilise the conservative party."" It's a provocative thesis that is not entirely unfounded. Johannes Bergh, the leader of the country's national election studies program, has been monitoring public attitudes. ""One of the major issues is whether Norway should continue looking for oil outside the coast of Norway or whether we should stop doing that, for the sake of the environment,"" he tells CGTN. ""This has become a big issue between the political parties and it remains to be seen what happens after the election, but certainly there is a chance that some of the green parties, they will not have a majority in parliament but they will have some influence over the new government.""

? British Prime Minister Boris Johnson will reveal new plans to manage the pandemic during the UK's colder months this week. Health minister Sajid Javid said he did not expect this to include any more lockdowns but in a government U-turn, he did rule out the use of vaccine passports to allow people to attend nightclubs and mass events in England.

? Greek police fired tear gas and water cannon at demonstrators on Saturday as more than 15,000 people, including labor union members, rallied in Greece's second-biggest city of Thessaloniki to protest against mandatory vaccinations and coronavirus regulations.

? More than 120,000 people demonstrated across France on Saturday, in the ninth consecutive weekend of protests against health passes that activists say discriminate against the unvaccinated. Although much smaller, similar rallies took place in the city-state of Monaco and Austria's capital Vienna.

? Hospital employees, care-givers, firefighters and ambulance drivers are just some of the 2.7 million French professionals who will have to be vaccinated to work as new rules go into effect from Wednesday. But with many yet to receive even their first dose, France's healthcare system could struggle if not enough workers get behind the mandate.

? Several thousand Polish healthcare workers demonstrated in Warsaw on Saturday to demand better wages and working conditions, hitting out at the government for not compensating them for the increased workload caused by the pandemic.

? In North Macedonia, hundreds of people marched on Saturday to honor the 14 people killed in a fire at a coronavirus field hospital earlier this week. The fire, thought to be accidental, broke out late Wednesday, destroying the facility, killing 12 patients and two visiting relatives, and injuring 12 others."
Chinese-made games dominate the U.S. market for the first time,"The mobile gaming sector is worth billions globally, and sales data has revealed how Chinese game developers have gained market dominance for the first time.

In the first half of 2021, 220 of the top 1,000 games bought or downloaded in the U.S. were made by companies headquartered in China.

That's a 6 percent increase over the past two years, and crucially puts Chinese game developers above U.S. firms for the first time. Meanwhile, the U.S. developers' market share has dropped 10 percent over two years.

Chinese developers also dominate the European market, with more than 10 percent growth across key markets ¨C UK, France, Germany, Russia and Turkey.

Russian and Swedish games companies have also made gains in Europe since 2019, but China-developed mobile games are the most popular."
Ceremony in London remembers Brits killed on 9/11,"03:20

Of the almost 3,000 killed in the 9/11 terror attacks 20 years ago, 67 were from the UK. There was an open-air service for relatives and family members in the park of Grosvenor Square, an affluent area of west London which for decades housed the U.S. Embassy. A statue of former President Roosevelt still stands in the park. Around 150 people attended the memorial service, with police closing nearby streets and ensuring that the park was off-limits to all apart from those attending the September 11 UK Families Support Group event. Other commemorative events were held at a 9/11 memorial in the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park in the east end of London. There, installed in 2015, is an 'After 9/11' sculpture created by Miya Ando, using fragments of the World Trade Center and given to the UK by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey in 2010. Steel girders have been erected vertically to honour all 9/11 victims, including the 67 from the UK.

At 1.46 p.m. local time, a minute's silence was observed in the UK. Queen Elizabeth sent a message to U.S. President Joe Biden, saying that her prayers remained with victims and survivors of the attacks, and paying tribute to the communities that joined together to rebuild after the devastation. ""My thoughts and prayers ¡ª and those of my family and the entire nation ¡ª remain with the victims, survivors and families affected, as well as the first responders and rescue workers called to duty,"" she said.

In many ways this anniversary was probably overshadowed by the fall of Afghanistan to the Taliban ¨C 20 years almost to the day after the 9/11 attacks that led to the Afghan war and ousting the Taliban movement that had controlled the country between 1996 and 2001. Hundreds of UK servicemen and women have died in wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. Successive UK prime ministers have followed former PM Tony Blair in remaining loyal to U.S. policies of trying to change regimes, control and then rebuild countries that had been shattered in long and expensive wars. Almost 3,000 may have died in the biggest terrorist attack on U.S. soil, but hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians have been killed in the past two decades in Afghanistan and Iraq especially. Just as in the U.S. a raft of new laws were introduced to fight foreign and home-grown terrorists attacking the UK ¨C London has seen the most attacks ¨C by Al Qaeda supporters, and later ISIS. There have been several individual attacks as well as the bigger and carefully orchestrated 7/7 bombings in London in 2005. Such attacks have failed to divide those who believe in freedom and democracy, British PM Boris Johnson said in a recorded video message marking the 20th anniversary of 9/11. ""While the terrorists imposed their burden of grief and suffering, and while the threat persists today, we can now say with the perspective of 20 years that they failed to shake our belief in freedom and democracy,"" Johnson said. ""They failed to drive our nations apart, or cause us to abandon our values, or to live in permanent fear.""

"As she leaves office, Angela Merkel confirms 'I am a feminist'","In her 16 years as German Chancellor, Angela Merkel has often been asked about feminism ¨C and just as frequently avoided directly answering the question. But now, as she prepares to leave office, she has made her position on feminism clear.

""For me, the word feminism is indeed also connected to a certain movement that has fought very hard to put these things on the social agenda,"" she said on Wednesday.

""And that's why I mentioned praise, which I didn't want to claim for myself. Queen Maxima of the Netherlands opened the door for me by saying: In principle, it is about men and women being equal in the sense of participating in social life, in life as a whole.

""And in this sense, today I can affirmatively say: Then I am a feminist.""

Speaking at an event with Nigerian writer Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie at Duesseldorf Schauspielhaus theatre, Merkel discussed many of the the highs and lows of her career.

Merkel recalled an event at the Women20 summit in Berlin in 2017, when she was asked if she would describe herself as a feminist.

""Back then, I was a bit shy when I said that on stage,"" she said. ""Today it is better thought out. And therefore, in this sense, I can say: Yes, we should all be feminists."""

Leaders across Europe and around the world have sent messages commemorating the 20th anniversary of 2001's September 11 terrorist attacks, in which four planes were hijacked and deliberately flown into U.S. buildings, causing thousands of deaths. European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen tweeted ""On 9/11 we remember those who lost their lives and honour those who risked everything to help them. Even in the darkest, most trying of times, the very best of human nature can shine through. The EU stands with the USA in defending freedom and compassion over hate.""

""The horrific attacks of #September11 20 years ago changed the course of history. We remember the victims and noble sacrifice of so many first responders and aid workers,"" added European Council president Charles Michel. ""The EU stands by the U.S. and [its president Joe Biden] in the continued fight against terrorism and extremism in all its forms."" National leaders also added their commemorations. Tweeting bilingually in French and English, French president Emmanuel Macron insisted ""We will #NeverForget. We will always fight for freedom,"" with a U.S. flag emoji. The tweet was accompanied by a short film of the U.S. flag flying in France.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel sounded a warning note that the struggle is far from over, referencing the Western forces' recent withdrawal from a Taliban-controlled Afghanistan. ""We have now had to recognize that although we have been able to defeat terrorism, which is endangering our security, at the present time we have not achieved all our goals,"" Merkel said in a speech. ""That is why it is important for us on the German side to safeguard what we have been able to achieve, education for girls and the like, although we know that this will not be easy with the Taliban. Above all, bringing citizens in need of protection to Germany and giving them protection is something we feel we have a moral obligation to do."" UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson recorded a three-minute speech for his tweet, in which he insisted that ""While the terrorists imposed their burden of grief and suffering, and while the threat persists today, we can now say with the perspective of 20 years that they failed to shake our belief in freedom and democracy. They failed to drive our nations apart, or cause us to abandon our values, or to live in permanent fear.""

Elsewhere in the UK, the U.S. national anthem was played as a tribute during the changing of the guard at Windsor Castle, while Queen Elizabeth II sent a personal message saying that ""My thoughts and prayers ¡ª and those of my family and the entire nation ¡ª remain with the victims, survivors and families affected, as well as the first responders and rescue workers called to duty. ""My visit to the site of the World Trade Center in 2010 is held fast in my memory. It reminds me that as we honor those from many nations, faiths and backgrounds who lost their lives, we also pay tribute to the resilience and determination of the communities who joined together to rebuild.""

Other countries asserted their solidarity with the ongoing fight against terrorism. ""Affirming the unconditional rejection of terrorism everywhere and always,"" said a Swiss government tweet, noting that the country¡¯s president Guy Parmelin ""expresses his solidarity with all of its victims."" Similarly, Italian president Sergio Mattarella said ""Italy stands in solidarity with the United States and its other allies to counter any terrorist threat."" Writing in an opinion piece, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison warned ""September 11 reminded us that freedom is always fragile. As Ronald Reagan said, it 'must be fought for and defended constantly by each generation'. ""That day was an attack on free peoples everywhere. It was an attack on our way of life and the values of liberal democracy. Despite the pain inflicted on that day, the terrorists ultimately failed in their attempts to crush our resolve and change our way of life."" In the U.S. itself, Biden spent the anniversary traveling to ceremonies at each of the three crash sites. Although he did not speak publicly on the day, he released a video on the eve of the anniversary honoring the memories of the victims and those who risked or gave their lives during rescue missions.

Biden also acknowledged the ""darker forces of human nature ¨C fear and anger, resentment and violence against Muslim Americans, true and faithful followers of a peaceful religion"" that he said had bent, but not broken, American unity. ""To me, that's the central lesson of September 11, is that at our most vulnerable, in the push and pull of all that makes us human, and the battle for the soul of America, unity is our greatest strength,"" he said. ""Unity doesn't mean we have to believe the same thing. We must have a fundamental respect and faith in each other, and in this nation."" Former president Barack Obama, for whom Biden served as vice-president, tweeted ""Today we honor the nearly 3,000 men, women, and children who died on September 11, 2001, and the heroes who have always run towards danger to do what's right. Let's never forget that day, and let's never take them for granted.""

Europe reminded of its own wave of attacks (by Giles Gibson) In the wake of the 9/11 attacks, European nations have gone through their own horrifying terror attacks and marked their own somber anniversaries. In July 2005, a series of attacks on London's public transport left 56 people dead. In November 2015, 130 people died in Paris when gunmen and bombings hit a sports stadium, a music venue and several restaurants and bars. Like the U.S., countries in Europe are also still grappling with the aftermath of these acts of terror. A trial that's expected to last nine months has just kicked off in France, with 20 defendants suspected of involvement in the 2015 Paris attacks.

Europe-U.S. tensions The events of 9/11 also led to tension between European nations and the United States. While German, French and other European troops were involved in the invasion of Afghanistan in 2001, Germany and France publicly opposed the Iraq War two years later. More recently, the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan has forced the European Union to take a close look at its own military capabilities. The European Union's High Representative for Foreign Affairs, Josep Borrell, described the chaotic withdrawal as a ""wake-up call"" for the bloc. ""As a global economic and democratic power, can Europe be content with a situation where we are unable to ensure, unassisted, the evacuation of our citizens and those under threat because they have helped us?"" asked Charles Michel, the President of the European Council. Senior E.U. leaders are now calling for the bloc to set up a rapid-reaction military force, a debate that could rumble on for months.

What is the role of NATO post-Afghanistan?,"02:56

It is clear now, if it wasn't before, that America has decided that for the foreseeable future it has a very limited appetite for military engagement - Former UK prime minister Tony Blair

The chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan and lack of consultations over both the peace treaty with the Taliban and the withdrawal date has left many in Europe concerned about their dependence on the United States. Now the message from Washington is that the days of nation-building are over. Earlier this week Britain's former prime minister Tony Blair gave a speech on Afghanistan at the Royal United Services Institute security and defence think-tank. ""It is clear now, if it wasn't before, that America has decided that for the foreseeable future it has a very limited appetite for military engagement,"" said Blair. READ MORE China's first COVID-19 vaccine factory in Europe Auto show focuses on electric future Tennis's new British-Chinese-Romanian star

European defense ministers have also expressed concern. Following a meeting of EU defense and foreign ministers in Slovenia, the bloc's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell revived calls for some form of European army to act when the U.S. will not. ""Afghanistan has shown that the deficiencies in our strategic autonomy come with a price and that the only way forward is to combine our forces and strengthen not only our capacity but also our will to act,"" Borrell told a press conference. Britain has one of Europe's largest armed forces, with considerable overseas combat and peacekeeping experience. Successive governments have long opposed the idea of a separate European defense policy outside of NATO ¨C but the UK is no longer in the European Union to argue its case.

Romanian political chaos threatens economy and fight against pandemic,"USR-Plus politicians resigned from the government en masse. /Ilona Andrei/AFP USR-Plus politicians resigned from the government en masse. /Ilona Andrei/AFP

Romania's ruling coalition government fell apart this week, and only speedy political maneuvering has let Prime Minister Florian Citu remain in post. Citu has been in the job for less than a year, after the former finance minister replaced Ludovic Orban, who resigned last December. But Citu's National Liberal Party (PNL) could only keep power via a center-right coalition with the Save Romania Union party (USR-Plus). This week Citu fired Justice Minister Stelian Ion, a USR-Plus representative, and unbalanced the ruling group.

Not only did the move anger USR-Plus, but it also led to Orban speaking out against his replacement. With USR-Plus ministers resigning from government, the party tried to hold a ""no confidence"" vote, aiming to return Orban to power. But political wrangling by Citu and his PNL colleagues convinced the opposition Social Democrat Party (PSD) to abstain from the vote, meaning the parliament in Bucharest did not have enough members present to hold the vote. The case has now been passed ¨C by Citu ¨C to the country's constitutional court, in what is seen by some as a worrying step. ""The right of an MP to initiate a motion of no-confidence is essential to the function of democracy,"" minority group MP Iulius Marian Firczak told EUObserver.

COVID-19 impact All of this is happening while COVID-19 cases continue to rise in Romania, as vaccination rates remain dangerously low. As of September 9 less than 30 percent of the population had been vaccinated. By comparison, 58 percent of neighbouring Hungary's population is vaccinated. The health ministry has warned that many hospitals in Bucharest are close to capacity again. The fear is political deadlock would harm Romania's ability to fight the virus and to ensure as many people as possible are vaccinated, and the country's health may face similar problems to its economy. Gas and electricity prices are rising steadily, and the country's foreign trade gap has increased by 65 percent in one year ¨C which some argue could open Romania up to problems with foreign debt ownership.

Afghanistan: What's Next? ¨C The Agenda with Stephen Cole,"September 11, 2021 marks the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 terror attacks, an atrocity which led directly to the U.S.-led invasion of Afghanistan.

Two decades on, the Taliban is back in control of the country. But what does this really mean for the future of Afghanistan and its people, politically, diplomatically and economically? That's the subject on this week's edition of The Agenda with Stephen Cole."
The Terror Threat ¨C Petraeus assesses the future of Afghanistan,"08:13

WHAT'S THE ISSUE? The issue which perhaps most still concerns the West now the Taliban are back in power in Afghanistan is that the country will once again become a haven for Islamist terror groups like Al-Qaeda and ISIS-K. David Petraeus ¨C former commander of international security forces in Afghanistan, as well as a former director of the CIA ¨C joins The Agenda with Stephen Cole to explain how things may play out from here ¨C and why there may be some hope that the new Taliban administration may not be so amenable to terrorist groups operating within the Afghan borders.

MEET THE EXPERT David Petraeus has now retired after 37 years in the U.S. Army. Over his career he rose to be Commander of U.S. Central Command, overseeing military efforts in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Central Asia, the Arabian Peninsula and Egypt. In 2010 he became Commanding General of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan. Following his retirement, he served as Director of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency.

WHAT DOES PETRAEUS SAY? ""I have said that if you are trying to ensure that Islamist extremists are not able to reconstitute themselves, you have to keep an eye on them,"" Petraeus says. ""So the effort now is to ensure that extremists cannot re-establish a sanctuary in Afghanistan. And now it's not just Al Qaida, it's also the Islamic State Khorasan group affiliate that is in the region."" While warning that ""clearly it will be vastly more difficult"" to operate from outside Afghanistan, Petraeus is at least confident that ""we have a lot of capabilities now that we didn't have prior to 9/11"" ¨C and he notes cause for optimism in that the Taliban will need outside help to keep the country afloat. ""The Taliban is about to confront a very serious reality, and that is that their government budget requires somewhere in the neighborhood of $18 to $20 billion a year,"" he reveals. ""And without U.S. and Japanese and other major donors funding, they're going to have a very substantial budget shortfall."""

"UK threatens France migrant 'pushback', despite claims it's illegal","02:48

A row is brewing between the UK and French governments over illegal migrants crossing the Channel. The Home Office in London and the Interior Ministry in Paris have traded statements. More than 14,000 people have crossed the 20 miles of sea between France and Britain so far this year, including around 1,300 already in September. Earlier this year, the UK's Home Secretary Priti Patel and France's counterpart Gerald Darmanin agreed the UK would contribute $75 million to France to help patrol 60 miles of its coastline, where migrants and people-smugglers often launch small boats to try to reach the UK.

The UK government has threatened to hold back money due unless the French authorities do more to stem the flow of migrants. It is now considering a controversial ""pushback policy"" to force migrants in small boats back towards France. UK border patrol boats could be sanctioned to encourage migrant boats away from British waters. The French government reaction was quick. ""France will not accept any practice that goes against maritime law or any financial blackmail. Great Britain's commitments should be upheld. I've said this clearly to my [British] counterpart Priti Patel,"" Gerald Darmanin tweeted.

Migrants and those traveling on boats are protected under international law. And the UK threat has already provoked a response. Amnesty International describes the UK's plan as, ""senseless, dangerous and almost certainly unlawful."" Naomi Phillips, Director of Policy and Advocacy at the British Red Cross said the UK response should be caring, not turning people away. ""Crossing the Channel in a small boat is only ever a desperate last resort, and an extremely dangerous one. When people's lives are in danger they need help, compassion and humanity, not to have their ordeal extended.""

Twitter.com/pritipatel Twitter.com/pritipatel

A former head of the UK's Border Force, Tony Smith, said forcing back migrants in often suspect boats and dinghies would be dangerous and illegal. ""Under the UN Convention of the Law of the Sea, is the preservation of life above all else, and so both the French and the British should be committed to that, and making sure that nobody dies."" UK Border officers are already preparing to stop migrants, even if they are in small boats. Lucy Moreton spoke on behalf of the Immigration Services Union to CGTN Europe. ""The idea is to initially ask them to change course, then to try to push them using either a boat or a smaller vessel to try to encourage them to turn. But you've got to do it quite carefully because you don't want to overturn a small or unstable or otherwise vulnerable vessel,"" she said. Under international law, people have the right to seek asylum in any country in which they arrive. As the UK is no longer a member of the European Union, an EU law that allows asylum-seekers to be transferred back to the first member state they were proved to have entered, no longer applies to the UK. And the thorny issue of UK-EU cooperation on immigration has yet to be agreed. This row with France will raise many questions and eyebrows, as it's hard to judge without French, Belgian and Dutch help how the UK government can reduce the flow of illegal migrants endangering their lives crossing the sea.

Mediterranean fast becoming climate change hotspot,"02:36

A firefighter has died and more than 900 people needed to be evacuated from their homes in Estepona, southern Spain, as a wildfire continues to rage for a third day. Meanwhile, a 1,500 hectare fire is also destroying forests in northern Spain. On Friday morning, the Andalusian regional government increased the warning level, as more than 400 members of the emergency services tried to bring the blaze under control. The southern fire follows another huge wildfire in Lugo, Galicia, northern Spain. A major concern is the suspicion that both fires were started intentionally, with investigations still ongoing.

CGTN Europe spoke to meteorologist Martin Barreiro. He said if the wildfires were started on purpose, it made the situation even more dangerous for firefighters. ""When the authorities suspect a wildfire is intentional, they start by looking for the origin of the fire. If they see that it began in different places across different areas at the same time, then it's obvious it was intentional. This also makes the fire far more aggressive and difficult to control."" The current wildfires in Spain are the latest in a series of blazes that have swept across southern Europe this summer, from Portugal to Turkey. In recent years a lack of rainfall and increasingly hot temperatures has made vegetation tinder-dry in Spain. Strong winds have also provided the perfect conditions for wildfires.

Schools and universities in Afghanistan reopen amid uncertainty,"02:37

The junior years of the GAM School of Excellence in downtown Kabul appear to be unaffected by the political turmoil that has engulfed Afghanistan. Boys and girls are studying in the same classroom. Female teachers are taking classes. The school reopened its doors to students in grade one to six less than two weeks ago.

Sajad Qarbiny, a staff member of the school, says older children attending the middle and high school departments are still waiting for the green light to reopen from the new interim government. Those who have resumed their schooling are aware their future education hangs in the balance. Student Mustafa says he hopes Afghanistan can be peaceful and secure, so he can study as normal and become a doctor and serve the country. University studies in Afghanistan have also resumed this week. Attendance is strikingly low, with many students either afraid to return or having fled the Taliban's takeover.

During the hardline Islamist group's rule in the 1990s, girls were banned from school and women were denied employment. So it is a relief for many female students that they can still attend classes, although they have to wrestle with new restrictions, including segregation from their male classmates. Female students now must only be taught by female teachers or older men and use a separate entrance. They must also end their lessons five minutes earlier than male students to stop them from mingling outside. The wearing of hijabs is mandatory.

Amir Noori, a teacher at Avicenna University, said the situation would have a negative impact on the female students' motivation to study. The Taliban has repeatedly said in recent weeks that women's rights will be honored in accordance with Islamic law. What that means in practice will be closely monitored by the international community, which has urged the group to uphold its commitments to human rights in return for aid and recognition.

COVID-19 vaccines are working... but there's one anomaly in UK data,"First, the good news for anyone lucky enough to have been fully vaccinated ¨C UK figures suggest you are much less likely to become seriously ill or die after testing positive for COVID-19 than unvaccinated people. According to Public Health England's latest vaccine surveillance report:

- two doses of a COVID-19 vaccine cut a person's chances of being infected by 65 to 90 percent; - two AstraZeneca doses cut the chances of dying from COVID-19 by 75 to 99 percent; - two Pfizer doses cut the chances of death by 95 to 99 percent; - one dose only cuts transmission to other people, if someone is infected, by close to 50 percent. For the first time, the report includes figures to allow comparison of the rates of infection, hospitalization and death between vaccinated people and those who have not been vaccinated. And this is where the rather surprising result appears.

Graphs from Public Health England's vaccine surveillance report. /Public Health England Graphs from Public Health England's vaccine surveillance report. /Public Health England

There is a higher rate of COVID-19 among people who have been vaccinated and are between the ages of 40 and 79, than there is among people of the same age who are not vaccinated.

The report says it is not clear why this might be the case. ""The rate of a positive COVID-19 test is substantially lower in vaccinated individuals compared with unvaccinated individuals up to the age of 39, and in those aged greater than 80,"" reads the report. ""In individuals aged 40 to 79, the rate of a positive COVID-19 test is higher in vaccinated individuals compared with unvaccinated. This is likely to be due to a variety of reasons, including differences in the population of vaccinated and unvaccinated people as well as differences in testing patterns."" Taking the example of people aged 40 to 49 in the UK in the four weeks to September 5, positive COVID-19 tests were recorded at a rate of 1,162 per 100,000 people who have been double vaccinated, compared with a rate of 880 for unvaccinated people. This comes despite figures elsewhere in the report saying that the chance of anyone getting COVID-19 after being vaccinated are between 60 and 90 percent lower than those who have not been vaccinated. Although no conclusion is reached on why vaccinated people are testing positive at a higher rate, it could be that unvaccinated people take more steps to avoid infection, or are less likely to get tested, or maybe have built up immunity because they have had COVID-19 in the past. According to the report, 97.7 percent of the UK adult population now have antibodies to COVID-19 from either infection or vaccination.

Russia completes controversial Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline to Germany,"05:27

Nord Stream 2, the controversial gas pipeline from Russia to Germany, has been completed according to Gazprom, the Russian gas company that built the route. Alexey Miller, chairman of the management committee, announced completion at 8:45 a.m. Moscow time on Friday. The 1,200km pipeline follows much the same route as the original Nord Stream pipeline under the Baltic Sea. It leaves Russia from Ust-Luva, near St Petersburg, before surfacing in Greifswald, northern Germany. The underwater gas line has caused significant controversy, as critics say it could allow Russia to wield power over Europe. It is also predicted to take business away from a gas line that runs through Ukraine to EU nations.

But Nord Stream 2 will double the amount of gas Germany can import from Russia, with the new system designed to deliver up to 55bn cubic meters of natural gas per year, meaning the full Gazprom access to European gas supplies will be 110bn cubic meters each year. More than 500bn cubic meters of natural gas is used in Europe each year. There is speculation gas will begin running through Nord Stream 2 as soon as October, but the pipeline needs to be cleared by authorities and pass safety checks before anything will flow. German regulators will also need to give a final sign-off. Yuriy Vitrenko, CEO of Ukraine's state gas company Naftogaz, has called on EU authorities to delay the certification. Vitrenko said Naftogaz has lodged ""necessary arguments in Berlin and Brussels,"" relating to the EU's energy rules, which stipulate a split between production, transit and supply.

Are best-before and use-by dates making us waste more food?,"04:11

We live in a world full of contradictions and extreme inequality ¨C including the fact that not only do food waste and food uncertainty coexist across the globe, but they are closely related.

According to data collected by the United Nations, one-third of all food produced is thrown away every year. That's 1.3 billion tons of grown food that never make it from the field to people's plates. It's a problem that not only has moral implications, but also financial ones ¨C food waste is estimated to cost the global economy $2.6 trillion a year.

Food waste rotting in landfills releases significant amounts of methane into the atmosphere. /Chonticha Vatpongpee/EyeEm/Getty Creative Food waste rotting in landfills releases significant amounts of methane into the atmosphere. /Chonticha Vatpongpee/EyeEm/Getty Creative

At the same time, nearly one billion people suffer hunger across the world every year.

""Unfortunately, we do have these twin evils of food waste and food insecurity coexisting and both growing very rapidly,"" says Tessa Clarke, CEO and co-founder of Olio, a UK-based mobile app for food sharing aimed at reducing food waste.

""The amount of food that's wasted in the Western world is shocking,"" says Clarke. ""A quarter of the food we waste could feed all of the 800 million people who go to bed hungry each day in the world.""

Clarke's solution is a local community-based approach. The app she helped to create allows neighbors to exchange and share food instead of throwing it away, and to connect people with businesses that can redistribute their unsold surplus instead of sending it to the bins.

While use-by dates need observing, best-before dates need assessment before determining whether the food is actually expired. /Thomas B. Shea via VCG While use-by dates need observing, best-before dates need assessment before determining whether the food is actually expired. /Thomas B. Shea via VCG

But she believes there's an argument for businesses to revise their food labeling system. ""We definitely think that there is some merit in revisiting date labeling, in particular looking at what products' use-by dates apply to,"" says Clarke. ""A number of retailers in the UK have stopped putting use-by dates on certain products that could actually suffice with a best-before date instead.""

In the UK and in the European Union, use-by dates indicate when it's safe to eat the food and the date after doing so could give you food poisoning. Best-before dates indicate when the quality of the food starts decreasing and the product is just not as fresh. Confusion between the two labels often leads to extra food waste, when it could have still been eaten safely. A study by the European Commission in 2018, found that up to 10 percent of the 88 million tons of food waste generated annually in the EU were linked to date labels. By the end of next year, the EU Commission is expected to propose a revision of EU rules on date marking that will avoid confusion and misinterpretation of food use-by and best-before labels."

Creating opportunity cannot mean more burden on women: Pathfinders,"Li Xiaoyun has dedicated his career to researching ways out of the poverty trap as one of the most well-respected authorities on the subject in China.

However, his work has gone far beyond just study. In the field, he has led projects to put into effect the economic opportunities he has discovered.

One such project is in Hebian village in Yunnan province, where farmers have been encouraged to supplement and balance their incomes with earnings from hosting urban tourists.

The village has attracted business conferences and events, bringing additional opportunities to market local produce on top of the benefits of hosting visitors.

Li says in planning the project he has focused on ensuring efforts to empower women do not backfire by placing further burdens on them.

""One particular challenge that arises along the way is that programs that intend to empower women usually end up always generating additional workload for women.

""If we cannot solve this challenge, poverty cannot be eliminated ,since women are more prone to poverty.""

Poland's opposition-led upper house blocked a broadcast reform bill that critics believe is poised to silence a U.S.-owned news channel critical of the government. The Senate rejected the legislation in a vote of 53 to 37 with three abstentions on Thursday. The bill is now expected to go back to the lower house, where the ruling party has a thin majority and could overturn the result. The controversial reforms set out to strengthen a ban on companies outside the European Economic Area controlling Polish broadcasters.

If the reform passed, it would be most likely to affect Poland's largest independent television channel TVN24, owned by U.S.-based media group Discovery Inc. The channel is one of the most watched in the Central European nation and owns news channel TVN24, which is often critical of the government on subjects such as LGBT+ rights, judicial reform and run-ins with the European Union. TVN24's broadcast license is due to expire on September 26 and it is not clear if the channel would be granted an extension if the bill passes. Changes to media ownership rules have been denounced by the U.S. and called out by opposition politicians within Poland as an effort to control the media. The ruling Law and Justice party says the legislation is aimed at ensuring fair news coverage, accusing foreign outlets of an anti-government bias. However, in a sign the ruling party may be backing away amid a mounting international backlash, President Andrzej Duda, a Law and Justice ally, has indicated he may veto the bill.

The magnet is one of six that will form part of the largest and most integrated superconducting magnet system ever built. It is all happening at the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) project north of Marseille. The goal of this scientific megaproject is to show that fusion energy could provide near endless, green power. The magnet system aims to generate an extremely powerful field to control an energy-producing plasma that is intensely hot. The plasma will be shaped and steered in a ""tokamak"" at a temperature of 150 million degrees Celsius. A tokamak is an experimental machine designed to harness the energy of fusion and the one being built in the French countryside will be the world's biggest, housed in a building 60 meters high.

A decades-old recording proves some ducks can 'talk',"01:51

More than 30 years ago, a scientist in Australia unexpectedly heard something that would shock the world decades later ¨C a musk duck repeatedly saying ""you bloody fool"" and making a noise that sounded like a door closing. A scientist named Peter J. Fullagar recorded the duck, named Ripper, sometime around 1987. But it only gained international attention when a researcher in the Netherlands came across it during a review on birds and vocal learning, which is what Ripper was demonstrating at the time. ""When I first heard it, it was very surprising to me ¡­ and I could hardly believe that was possible,"" said Carel ten Cate, a professor of animal behavior at Leiden University. ""It was such a deviant sound from everything that you can imagine that a duck might make that I was really very stunned by it.""

Ten Cate then analyzed and verified the recording before publishing his findings in the journal Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, with Fullagar as a co-author. Ripper's harsh words proved that musk ducks are one of the few species capable of vocal learning. It's an ability they share with humans and it enables animals to repeat sounds they previously heard. That's how we can learn languages, or parrots can repeat the words of a caretaker. Ripper probably learnt his now-famous words in his youth when he was raised by human caretakers in captivity, according to Ten Cate. ""The reason that this duck is producing the human phrase, 'you bloody fool,' and the slamming door. That's most likely because they were produced in the context of the animal caretaker entering the cage, probably providing food for the duck,"" he told CGTN Europe. ""So, it says 'you bloody fool.' But you may also hear 'your bloody food.'""

Musk ducks are an aggressive species native to Australia. /CFP Musk ducks are an aggressive species native to Australia. /CFP

Other animals with this ability include parrots, hummingbirds, certain songbirds, whales, elephants, seals, bats and humans. Although there were bird groups on this list before Ripper, it is still surprising that a duck demonstrated this skill. That is because they have ""brains that are quite different from that of songbirds and parrots and hummingbirds, which are the imitators among the birds,"" Ten Cate added. The recording of Ripper wasn't the only evidence of this ability in the species, although he was the first known case. Ten Cate has also found evidence of musk ducks imitating sounds such as a coughing caretaker, a squeaking door and a snorting pony. Further research is still needed on why musk ducks can do this. But he added that this could mean other unknown animal groups are also capable of this rare feat. ""It might well be that some [other bird groups] might also contain one or more species in which, when examined, it turns out that they are also vocal,"" Ten Cate said."

On board the Russian nuclear-powered icebreaker 50 Let Pobedy (50 Years of Victory), Lobusov and his crew had an opportunity to observe how the Arctic landscape has changed in the past decades.

""The humidity has increased. We, as sailors, are especially watching this, cyclonic activity has changed,"" says Lobusov. ""Cyclones began to behave differently. In fact, today we [the crew] remembered: earlier it was simply impossible to get to the Pole in the summer without sunglasses, because the sun was shining so much. Now I think you will not see the sun."" Less ice freezing in the waters of the Arctic Ocean means the journey north is not as difficult as it used to be. But on the other hand, the landscape won't be the same majestic one adventurous explorers went to discover in the last century. ""The glaciers are crumbling. There are no questions here, without doubt this is the effect of heat,"" says Lobusov.

Race you home! Giant Galapagos tortoises settle in to new London pad,"Giant Galapagos tortoises Dolly, Polly and Priscilla completed a 200-meter dash to their new home at London Zoo this week. The three sisters were cheered on by the zookeepers, who kept a stash of treats handy to encourage them.

The tortoises are ""station-trained,"" which means they have learnt to walk to a cone and stand by it. Each tortoise was treated with lettuce, carrot or watermelon when they reached their designated colored cone.

""So the cones worked really well for about half of the journey but at that point, the tortoises started to get a little bit tired and we had to abandon the cones and just go to pure bribery and give them tasty treats to get them over the line,"" explained Chris Michaels, head of the herpetology team at the zoo.

Teenager Emma Raducanu has become Britain's first women's Grand Slam singles champion since 1977, and the first person to ever reach the final of the U.S. Open Tennis Championships after coming through a qualifying tournament. The 18-year-old, who was born in Canada to a Chinese mother and Romanian father before moving to the UK at the age of two, had already defied the odds by making it to the last two of the competition. But on Saturday, the teen completed her Grand Slam fairytale by beating Canadian Leylah Fernandez 6-4, 6-3 in the clash of the teens to be crowned U.S. Open champion.

""You say 'I want to win a Grand Slam,' but to have the belief I did, and actually executing, winning a Grand Slam, I can't believe it.""

High-profile fans of Raducanu took to social media to congratulate the rising tennis star, including Manchester United soccer star Marcus Rashford and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who said it was ""a sensational match!"" ""Huge congratulations to Emma Raducanu. You showed extraordinary skill, poise and guts and we are all hugely proud of you,"" he added. Queen Elizabeth II congratulated Raducanu, saying the triumph was ""a remarkable achievement at such a young age and is testament to your hard work and dedication."" All the more remarkable was that in her 10-match run to take the title, Raducanu did not drop a single set or even play a tie-break, beating much more experienced opponents with relative ease. Overcoming anxiety The win was particularly satisfying for many fans as Raducanu's only previous Slam appearance, at Wimbledon in July, ended when she pulled out of her fourth-round match after an anxiety attack. Despite her impressive game, Raducanu insisted that winning the U.S. Open was not as easy as she may have made it look. ""I'd say even though I didn't on paper drop a set, I think I faced a lot of adversity in every single one of my matches,"" she said. ""I can pick moments where I was down. ""Just to come through those are important. I think what I did very well this tournament was press in the moments that I really needed to.""

Although raised in an affluent borough of London by financier parents, Raducanu has ties to many countries ¨C her Twitter bio says 'london|toronto|shenyang|bucharest' ¨C and she said that having a ""Chinese mom, she definitely instilled in me from a young age hard work and discipline."" She also said that she had been inspired by the Chinese tennis star Li Na, who defeated Francesca Schiavone in the 2011 French Open final to become the first Chinese winner of a grand slam. ""Her inner strength and belief definitely stood out for me. The amount of mental strength and resiliency she showed, that match still sticks in my mind to this day,"" she said. Raducanu, who was ranked in the mid-300s when she played her first Grand Slam at Wimbledon in June, will now rise into the top 30 and become the British number one. As for how she plans to spend her time after smashing the U.S. competition and several tennis records, Raducanu said ""I have no idea what I'm doing tomorrow."" However, a shopping spree may be in order after she pocketed a winner's purse of $2.5 million for the win, almost 10 times her previous career earnings of $303,000. ""I'm just really trying to embrace the moment, really take it all in,"" she said: ""Right now, no care in the world, I'm just loving life.""

Germany's Foreign Minister Heiko Maas and U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken have called on the Taliban's new interim government in Afghanistan to be more cooperative with the international community.

""We hope that further government steps will send the necessary signals,"" said Maas during a joint press conference. ""It must be clear to the Taliban that international isolation is not in its interests and especially not in those of Afghanistan's people.""

The two met for in-person talks at Ramstein air base in southwest Germany Wednesday and were eventually joined by counterparts from more than 20 countries via videolink.

Both countries are hoping to pave a way for local staff who previously worked for foreign governments to be allowed to leave Afghanistan. However, Kabul's airport remains closed to international charter flights, which the two diplomats said was unacceptable.

""The Taliban are not permitting the charter flights to depart. They claim that some of the passengers do have the required documentation,"" said Blinken.

""There are limits to what we can do without personnel on the ground, without an airport with normal security procedures in place. We are doing everything in our power to support those flights and get them off the ground.""

Who is running the Taliban?

Relations between Europe and the U.S. were strained in August during a chaotic pull-out from Kabul that required the assistance of several foreign militaries.

Since then, tensions between the two sides have eased and they have focused efforts on deciding how to develop future diplomatic relations with Afghanistan.

Previous attempts to isolate the Taliban backfired and it is largely believed nations will try to establish some kind of framework for cooperation this time around.

Maas also said Germany was worried about a major humanitarian crisis that could be looming in Afghanistan. He called on Europe to do everything, including sending aid, to prevent it from happening.

""Food is already scarce in many parts of the country because of the drought. At the same time, the international aid payments on which many people depend have been stopped.

""And if a new government is not in a position to keep affairs of state running, there is a danger that the political collapse will be followed by economic collapse ¨C with even more drastic repercussions for the humanitarian situation,"" Maas said in a statement before the meeting."
"Ignore false claims about Xinjiang, China urges Western public","Government policies in Xinjiang have ""nothing to do with human rights, ethnic groups or religion but everything to do with fighting extremism, terrorism and separatism,"" he said.

""The China-UK relationship is at a critical juncture. We need to tap the potential for mutually beneficial co-operation between our two countries,"" he noted. He said the witnesses presented to the Tribunal were actors.

The briefing took place ahead of the second session of the so-called Uyghur Tribunal, due to start tomorrow in London.

Pseudo investigations into human rights allegations against China are ""political manipulations aimed at discrediting"" the country, its ambassador to the UK told journalists at an online event.

The Uyghur Tribunal describes itself as an independent group set up to investigate evidence of human rights abuses. It says it was launched at the request of the World Uyghur Congress ¨C a body that includes no China-based individuals on its 30-strong leadership committee and has accused China of committing genocide in the Xinjiang region, a suggestion strongly rebutted by Beijing.

Thursday's press briefing heard from arbitrator Graham Perry that there is no evidence of genocide in the region, despite the global spotlight having been focused there for a number of years.

The U.S. government and parliaments in some European countries have used the label to describe China's actions.

Asked by CGTN Europe's Paul Barber why China's message was failing to convince policymakers in the UK, Xu Guixiang, spokesman for the information office of Xinjiang, said opponents of China had closed their ears.

""They look at everything in Xinjiang with tinted glasses and have a hidden agenda in their minds,"" he said.

Ambassador Zheng also warned the British government, which has imposed sanctions on Chinese organizations and individuals, not to consider further measures.

""Any actions of that nature will certainly come back to haunt them and hurt the national interests of the UK,"" he said.

'False claims'

Among the dozens of claims the briefing addressed were suggestions that:

¡¤ Deradicalization centers are concentration camps: The briefing heard that the centers are similar to programs used in the U.S., the UK and France and are more like boarding schools where attendees learn skills and can arrange leave to see families.

¡¤ Government policies repress the rights of Uyghur minorities: Ambassador Zheng stated that the Uyghur population has been flourishing and enjoys improved economic and social opportunities. State policies in the region are aimed at improving lives and, in particular, eliminating the scourge of terrorism and extremism, he said.

¡¤ Mosques had been destroyed while new ""detention centers"" are being constructed: Abdureqip Tumulniyaz, president of the Xinjiang Islamic Association, told the briefing the mosques in question were dilapidated or unsuited to their function and had been rebuilt or renovated. Xu, from the information office of Xinjiang, said buildings claimed to be new ""detention"" centers were mainly hospitals, commercial premises, schools or government buildings.

¡¤ Accusations of torture, sexual abuse, forced labor and restrictions on communications were also dismissed by the panel."
"WHO booster jab plea, fatal fire in North Macedonia: COVID-19 Bulletin","TOP HEADLINES

¡¤ The World Health Organization (WHO) has called for a longer global moratorium on third vaccine doses until the end of the year, asking rich countries to delay booster jabs until every country has vaccinated at least 40 percent of its population. It had previously urged countries not to bring in booster programs until at least the end of September.

¡¤ COVAX is set to receive 575 million fewer vaccine doses this year than expected, according to the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (Gavi). That's nearly 30 percent short of COVAX's previous goal of 2 billion shots delivered to poorer countries this year.

¡¤ The WHO says the global vaccine production capacity is now running at 1.5bn a month, so ""it is a fixable problem"" if doses are shared. It has also rejected suggestions that poorer countries wouldn't be able to administer vaccine programs efficiently ¨C pointing out that most of these countries have systems in place, and experience, for mass-vaccination programs.

¡¤ Fourteen people have died in a fire at a hospital treating COVID-19 patients in North Macedonia, authorities said on Thursday. The fire broke out late on Wednesday after an explosion in a COVID-19 clinic in Tetovo in the northwest of the Balkan country. The cause of the fire is not yet known.

¡¤ People will be required to show a COVID-19 certificate to enter bars, restaurants and fitness centers in Switzerland from Monday, a move the Swiss government hopes will relieve pressure on hospitals struggling with a new wave of infections in the country. There are more than 3,500 new cases daily in Switzerland, where just more than half the population has been fully vaccinated.

¡¤ The Irish government has announced booster jabs will be offered to elderly people in the country who were fully vaccinated at least six months ago.

¡¤ Nerve disorder has been declared a ""very rare"" side effect of the AstraZeneca vaccine, occurring in fewer than one in 10,000 people. The European Medicines Agency said on Wednesday that a causal relationship between the vaccine and the neurological disorder Guillain-Barre syndrome, which can cause temporary paralysis, was ""considered at least a reasonable possibility."" A total of 833 cases of the syndrome had been reported worldwide by July 31, from about 592 million doses of AstraZeneca's Vaxzevria shot administered.

¡¤ Novavax has begun early-stage trials to test its combined flu and COVID-19 vaccine. The study will be conducted in Australia and it will enroll 640 healthy adults between the ages of 50 and 70 years and who have either been previously infected with the coronavirus or given a vaccine at least eight weeks prior to the study. Novavax hopes the combination of its two vaccines will lead to higher levels of protection.

¡¤ The city of Brussels in Belgium is expected to introduce a vaccine pass to enter bars and restaurant as of October 1.

¡¤ There are fears the virus will overwhelm the health system in Bulgaria, where only 20 percent of the population of 7 million people are vaccinated. The country has been reporting 10,000 new cases a week and dozens of daily deaths. This week, new restrictions have been announced in an effort to curb cases. Restaurants and cafes will close at 10 p.m., with a maximum of six people allowed to sit together.

¡¤ The head of the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for infectious disease in Germany has warned against a ""massive momentum"" in new cases in the fall if more people aren't vaccinated in the country.

¡¤ UK Health Secretary Sajid Javid said on Wednesday he supports the right of 12- to 15-year-olds to be able to receive a vaccine against the wishes of their parents,

¡¤ Japan, Serbia, Azerbaijan, Albania, Armenia and Brunei are the latest countries the European Union has taken off its COVID-19 travel safe list, amid concern over rising new infections."
WHO calls again for rich countries to close COVID-19 vaccine gap,"The WHO director-general has previously warned of COVID-19 vaccine inequality./Reuters/File The WHO director-general has previously warned of COVID-19 vaccine inequality./Reuters/File

The World Health Organization (WHO) urged vaccine manufactures and wealthy counties to deliver on their pledges to address global health inequalities. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus called on G20 countries to stop making promises and start delivering ¨C adding that the world's biggest economies hold the key to COVID-19 vaccine equality. Around 80 percent of the 5.5bn vaccine doses so far administered around the globe have been in high-income countries. ""We have heard excuses from manufacturers and some high-income countries about how low-income countries cannot absorb vaccines,"" Ghebreyesus said. He said this is not the case ¨C and almost all low-income countries have demonstrated an ability to run large-scale vaccination campaigns for polio, measles and other diseases. He noted it was a matter of manufacturers prioritizing and being legally obliged to fulfil deals with rich countries willing to pay the most, leaving low-income countries without the tools to protect their people. The WHO has set a target to enable every country to vaccinate at least 40 percent of its population by the end of this year.

Ghebreyesus also called for a moratorium on booster jabs until the end of the year ¨C with efforts to go toward the global vaccine target instead. The WHO has always pushed back against the use of booster jabs for the general population and Ghebreyesus repeated that they should only be used when people are immunocompromised or failed to develop antibodies. Instead of pursuing booster jabs, counties with high vaccine coverage have been asked to give up their place in the manufacturing queue to COVAX, so vaccines can be delivered to where they are needed most. Italy announced this week it will offer a third jab to those who are vulnerable, it follows speculation a similar decision will be made in the UK. Hungary was the first EU country to authorize a third dose, offering jabs from the beginning of August to anyone who was fully vaccinated at least four months earlier. It comes as COVID-19 cases continue to rise in Eastern and Central Europe. Czechia reported 588 new cases on Wednesday, the highest daily number since May. The country had reported significantly reduced COVID-19 numbers over the summer months, with lockdown measures eased across the nation. Earlier this week, Czechia's Prime Minister Andrej Babis said the government was not planning a return to broad lockdown measures, but ministers said local measures could be used in some scenarios."

The main suspect in a jihadist rampage that killed 130 people across Paris described himself defiantly as ""an Islamic State soldier"" and shouted at the top judge on Wednesday at the start of a trial into the 2015 attacks.

Salah Abdeslam, 31, is believed to be the only surviving member of the group that carried out the gun and bomb attacks on six restaurants and bars, the Bataclan concert hall and a sports stadium on November 13, 2015, in which hundreds were injured.

He appeared in court dressed in black and wearing a black face mask. Asked his profession, the French-Moroccan removed his mask and told the Paris court: ""I gave up my job to become an Islamic State soldier.""

While the other defendants, who are accused of providing guns, cars or helping plan the attacks, simply answered routine questions about their name and profession and otherwise remained quiet, Abdeslam clearly sought to use the start of the trial as a platform.

Asked by the court's top judge to give his name, Abdeslam used the Shahada, an Islamic oath, saying: ""I want to testify that there is no god except Allah and that Muhammad is his servant.""

He later shouted at the court's top judge for two minutes, saying the defendants had been treated ""like dogs,"" BFM television reported, adding that someone in the public section of the court, where victims and victims' relatives sit, shouted back: ""You b*****d, 130 people were killed.""

Victor Edou, a lawyer for eight Bataclan survivors, had said earlier that Abdeslam's statement that he is an Islamic State soldier was ""very violent.""

""Some of my clients are not doing too well ... after hearing a statement that they took as a new, direct threat,"" he said. ""It's going to be like that for nine months.""

Others said they were trying not to attach much importance to Abdeslam's comments.

""I need more to be shocked ... I'm not afraid,"" said Thierry Mallet, a Bataclan survivor.

Responsibility for the attacks was claimed by the so-called Islamic State (ISIS), which had urged followers to attack France over its involvement in the fight against the militant group in Iraq and Syria."
Sailing ship recreates historic journey from Sweden to China,"Within sight of the quayside where it was due to tie up, it struck a well-known rock, the Knipla Boro. All the sailors escaped with their lives and much of the cargo of porcelain, silk and spices was salvaged. The ship, however, remained stuck on the rock, taking years to disintegrate and disappear beneath the waves.

On September 12, 1745, the Gothenburg, a ship belonging to The Swedish East India Company was approaching the end of a 30-month journey bringing goods from China to its home port, the city after which it was named.

After divers excavated the wreck in the 1980s a replica of the Gothenburg was built. Next year the craft, which is claimed to be the world's largest operating wooden ship, will sail for the second time from the Swedish capital Stockholm to Shanghai in China.

August Jansson, the ship's captain, told CGTN: ""My colleagues who visited China last time, they got a very warm welcome and I hope we get the same when we arrive.""

The seven-month voyage will take it via London, Lisbon, Palma de Mallorca, Piraeus (Athens), Alexandria, Djibouti, Muscat, Chennai, Singapore, Ho Chi Minh City and Hong Kong before arriving in Shanghai in October 2022.

The journey is designed to showcase Swedish business and culture and strengthen and develop business opportunities and relations for businesses in both Sweden and the visited countries. It's also intended to promote sustainable solutions to some of the world's challenges.

It made a similar journey to Asia more than 15 years ago, but this is the first time in six years it has sailed.

""It's been more than 15 years since Gothenburg of Sweden last sailed to Asia, in 2005-2007, and we're extremely excited to see her sail again, said Peter Alexandersson, CEO of SOIC Ship Management, the company that operates the Gothenburg. A lot of work has been done in the last two years to make the ship ready to sail again.""

And no doubt they'll steer well clear of the Knipla Boro.

Europe's cocaine market now 'more competitive and more violent',"Agents of the Technical Criminal Investigation Agency (ATIC) carry packages containing cocaine seized from an anti-drug operation in Roatan, Honduras August 28, 2021. /Reuters/Fredy Rodriguez Agents of the Technical Criminal Investigation Agency (ATIC) carry packages containing cocaine seized from an anti-drug operation in Roatan, Honduras August 28, 2021. /Reuters/Fredy Rodriguez

Cocaine trafficking from Latin America to Europe used to be a business for the few. Now the market appears to be a ""free-for-all,"" which has made it more dangerous, a new report from Europol says.

Cocaine trafficking globally has been booming in the past decade. In 2018, the overall cocaine production in Colombia, Bolivia and Peru ¨C the three main producers of the drug ¨C was more than double that of 2013, according to the Global Initiative Against Organized Crime. The trade has been especially increasing towards Europe, where traffickers find a market with more potential for growth compared with the U.S. ""Many groups, particularly Colombian groups, have decided that it makes much better business sense to export drugs, not to the principal market, which is the United States, but to other markets, particularly Europe, where there is greater profit and less risk,"" explains Jeremy McDermott, co-founder and co-director of InSight Crime, a non-profit organization investigating and analyzing organized crime in Latin America and the Caribbean. READ MORE Masks for all as French schools return Poland declares emergency over Belarus border The drones fighting rural poverty With 91 tons of cocaine consumed every year in Europe, the drug is the continent's second most popular after cannabis. It's a market worth 5.7bn euros ($6.7bn), according to estimates by the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction. ""The production in cocaine is at record levels and this, of course, has meant that there's more on the market and that many of the Latin American groups, principally the Colombians, have decided to diversify their markets,"" says McDermott. ""Normally, of course, when you have a change in supply, prices fall. But if you create new demand by diversifying your market and delivering your cocaine to different parts of the world where there weren't necessarily markets before, then, of course there isn't a fall in price. And you are able to to continue to maximize your earnings even when there is an oversupply situation.""

Out with the old The criminal structures behind cocaine trafficking, say both Europol and the Global Initiative, are no longer the linear ones of the drug cartels. As the world's technology has evolved to make our planet more interconnected and globalized, so criminal groups across the world ""continue to evolve, diversify and become more efficient."" Since the criminal landscape in source countries such as Colombia ¨C Europe's number one supplier of cocaine ¨C has become more fragmented after the dissolution of the groups that traditionally controlled the production of cocaine, the rise of new trafficking actors has encouraged the formation of new alliances with criminal groups in Europe. Notably, say Europol experts, the Albanian-speaking and Western Balkan criminal networks have been taking advantage of this new situation and are now able to procure large quantities of cocaine directly from the source, cutting out any intermediary.

The lack of centralized control in the cocaine supply chain in Latin America means a market that was once dominated by the few, is now open to smaller international groups willing to chase the opportunity. On one hand, this means that organized crime groups such as the Italian 'Ndrangheta, that had enjoyed almost a monopoly on cocaine traffic from the Atlantic in previous decades, have lost their competitive advantage in the market. On the other hand, these groups haven't gone out of business either, but continue their trafficking activities in parallel with the new groups, contributing to the wave of cocaine supply washing through Europe. Criminal networks currently rely on a huge number of diversified actors, from hired assassins to transport specialists, money launderers, accountants and lawyers ¨C often from many different nationalities. ""The Colombians are the pioneers,"" says McDermott. ""The Mexicans still have what we would call 'cartel structures.' ""Colombia has gone into a rather sophisticated criminal network structure based on subcontracting, in the sense that no one group controls all the different links in the cocaine trade. Rather, they subcontract and they work with other partners who are specialized in different links in the chain,"" he explains. ""And it may be one structure has access to coca crops. Another structure specializes in sophisticated laboratories to extract the alkaloid and crystallize the cocaine. Another structure may control the port and can guarantee the contamination of containers heading to Europe, and so on."" What this means is that there's no single structure anymore for authorities to target, which makes it extremely difficult for security forces and law enforcement to stop the illegal traffic.

Moving north ¨C the new traffic routes The diversity of criminal actors needed for these sophisticated operations have made it so that new and more direct routes to Europe have also developed as new parties got involved. The majority of cocaine is shipped from Colombia, Peru and Bolivia through ports in Brazil, Ecuador and Venezuela. The two main transit regions used to be the Caribbean and West Africa ¨C but experts have observed that large quantities of cocaine are now arriving directly to North Africa, with Morocco reporting the biggest increase in traffic. Traditional entry ports to Europe are in Spain and Portugal in the south and Belgium and the Netherlands in the north. Recently, experts have noticed an increase in traffic in Belgium, particularly Antwerp and in Rotterdam for the Netherlands ¨C suggesting the trade is moving north. According to the Cocaine Insights report by Europol and the United Nations Office for Drugs and Crime, Europe's North Sea coast has overtaken the Iberian peninsula as the primary point of entry for cocaine reaching Europe.

Europe's 'most serious threat' As the cocaine market has become more competitive, the number of drug-related conflicts in Europe has also increased. ""We're seeing a strengthening of European organized crime linked to cocaine and we're also seeing increasing violence ¨C the sort of stuff that isn't normal on European streets, but is perhaps much more common here in Latin America,"" says McDermott. ""We've seen the assassination of lawyers, of witnesses linked to to cocaine cases."" In recent years, European authorities have reported public shootings, bombings, kidnappings, torture and intimidation associated with the drug market. In July 2020, a Franco-Dutch operation supported by Europol discovered that seven shipping containers detected in the Netherlands had been converted into cells to be used as torture chambers, featuring dentist chairs with straps and handcuffs. Europol has also warned the pandemic might be creating the perfect conditions for organized crime in the region to extend its reach and take hold in the continent, calling it the ""most serious internal security threat to the EU."" Nearly 40 percent of the criminal networks in Europe are active in drug trafficking. McDermott believes the flow of cocaine from Latin America to Europe is only likely to increase in the future. ""As Eastern Europe opens up increasingly and Russian and Balkan mafias with Eastern European connections and networks step up, one can see the European market as a whole growing,"" he says. ""Secondly, Europe has some of the most high-volume and efficient ports in the world and there are millions of containers going through these ports every week. And this infrastructure is what organized crime is going to continue to use because it's like a needle in a haystack. And they play the numbers game."" Europol recommends EU member states strengthen cooperation between law enforcement authorities and focus on money laundering investigations able to trace the illegal profits made by cocaine traffickers.

"Migrant crossings to England soar, straining France-UK relations","Migrants of all ages were rescued from a boat and taken to Dover, England. /Reuters/Peter Nicholls Migrants of all ages were rescued from a boat and taken to Dover, England. /Reuters/Peter Nicholls

Sunny weather has led to an increase in people trying to enter the UK on small boats across the Channel from France, with more than 1,000 arriving this week so far. On Monday, 785 people arrived in 27 boats, according to the UK Home Office. And French authorities said they stopped 378 people from making the crossing. Around 500 people arrived on Tuesday and, according to local reports, an undisclosed number of people were rescued by lifeguards on Wednesday. They were landed at the Port of Dover, on the south coast of England.

The latest spike in migrant arrivals has prompted the UK's Home Secretary Priti Patel to discuss the issue with her counterpart in France, Gerald Darmanin. They are meeting as part of a G7 summit in London on Wednesday. Patel has threatened to not pay $74m the UK has promised France to help stop the illegal boat journeys unless more boats are intercepted by French coastguards. On Tuesday, a group of lawmakers from the UK's ruling Conservative Party said the Home Office should ""up the stakes and consider immediate removal back to France of all who arrive via this illegal route and disregard diplomatic niceties."" This received a swift response from the French government, which warned such action would break international law on refugees. ""We also call on the British government to be cautious about the announced use of procedures to fight against attempted sea crossings, which would not only be dangerous for men, women and children onboard these boats, but contrary to international law,"" the Interior Ministry statement said.

$10bn takeover fight for UK supermarket Morrisons set for rare auction,"The $10bn takeover battle for British supermarket group Morrisons between two U.S. private equity groups looks set to be decided by a rarely used auction process.

Morrisons said on Wednesday it was in talks with Clayton, Dubilier & Rice (CD&R), Fortress Investment Group and Britain's takeover regulator about an auction to settle its future.

Last month, Morrisons agreed a 7bn pounds ($9.6bn) offer from CD&R, which has former Tesco boss Terry Leahy as a senior adviser. However, the rival consortium led by Softbank-owned Fortress could still trump that bid.

The fight for Britain's fourth-largest grocer after Tesco, Sainsbury's and Asda, is the most high-profile looming takeover amid a raft of bids and counter-bids, reflecting private equity's appetite for UK businesses.

Morrisons said that as neither bidder had declared its offer final, it was talking to both of them and the Takeover Panel, which governs mergers and acquisitions in the UK, about ""an orderly framework for the resolution of this competitive situation"" ¨C which would typically be an auction.

Morrisons said shareholder meetings to vote on the CD&R offer would be convened for around the week starting October 18.

It said any auction would take place prior to these shareholder meetings, on a date announced by the Takeover Panel.

CD&R's latest offer is worth 285 pence per Morrisons share ¨C a 60 percent premium to Morrisons' share price before takeover interest emerged in mid-June.

Fortress, the last offer from which was pitched at 272 pence a share, said on Wednesday it ""continues to consider its options.""

Morrisons shares were trading at 291.3 pence at 10:44 a.m. GMT, indicating investors are hoping for a higher bid.

CD&R had no further comment.

AUCTION PROCESS

The Takeover Panel's standard auction structure is bidding over a five-day period. However, if all parties are in agreement, a different structure can be used ¨C for example bidding over just one day.

Last month, the Takeover Panel set up an auction of British inhaler company Vectura for suitors Philip Morris International and U.S. private equity firm Carlyle. However, in the event Carlyle decided not to raise its offer.

Morrisons, which trades from 497 stores and has a more than 110,000 staff, reiterated on Wednesday that in addition to the financial terms of any offer it places ""very significant emphasis on the wider responsibilities of ownership,"" including the importance of employees, customers, pension trustees and suppliers.

Last month, the trustees of Morrisons' pension schemes warned a takeover by either CD&R or Fortress could ""materially weaken"" the security of the schemes if no additional protection was agreed.

Morrisons is due to publish its first-half results on Thursday.

Lotus to roll out thousands of new cars in China,"Lotus, owned by the Malaysian company Etika Automotive and the Chinese company Geely, will produce 2,000 new sport utility vehicles (SUVs) at its new factory in Wuhan next year. And then it will increase that to 20,000 new cars by 2023, according to its CEO Feng Qingfeng.

Lotus, the Chinese-owned British sports car maker, will open more than 50 new showrooms in China by 2024 to match an increase in demand for luxury cars amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

Lotus will also increase the number of showrooms in China, aiming to rival other car companies, such as Porsche, BMW and Audi.

Porsche reportedly sold 88,968 cars in the country last year, as COVID-19 travel restrictions left some with excess money to spend and increased demand for premium and luxury cars.

Lotus currently only has four showrooms in China. But it plans to increase that to 20, in cities such as Beijing and Shanghai next year and then expand that to between 50 to 70 showrooms across the country to cities including Ningbo and Suzhou in eastern China by 2024.

It is also considering an initial public offering in 2023, after its factory in Wuhan starts mass-producing its new cars."

Challenges ahead

Modernizing fleets before the end of the decade, as some brands have ambitiously promised, will be no easy feat, note industry analysts.

Brands will have to navigate evolving European Union laws and a challenging supply chain transition, all while ensuring the vehicles of the future match the power of the past.

Volkswagen's CEO Herbert Diess told reporters it was ""impossible"" for the German car maker to accelerate its transition to electric despite looming legal threats from environmental groups.

Other German brands such as Daimler and BMW could face similar legal challenges. Daimler's CEO Ola Kallenius told CGTN Europe he's prepared for the company to reach carbon neutrality by 2039.

""Net-zero in all dimensions ¨C supply chain, our own operations, of course, the product but also the product while it's in use,"" Kallenius said.

""This is 10 years ahead of the Paris Agreement, which is a very aggressive target for the whole business system.""

The Daimler CEO has promised that the brand's product portfolio ¨C which includes Mercedes and Smart ¨C will be all-electric by the end of the decade."

The European Commission has asked the EU's top court to impose daily fines on Poland for failing to take action to protect the independence of the country's justice system. Officials made the announcement on Tuesday, ramping up a long-running dispute with Warsaw over rule of law.

The EU says a controversial judges' disciplinary chamber is being used to pressure judges or exert political control over judicial decisions within Poland.

A previous European Court of Justice (ECJ) decision found the chamber undercuts EU law and must be dissolved. The Polish government said in August the chamber would be dismantled as part of wider judiciary reforms in the coming months.

However, the commission has argued that while the chamber may not be accepting any new cases, it is still working through existing cases ¨C stating it is taking action to ensure compliance. It would be up to the ECJ to set a sanction amount for any fines.

The European Commission also began new legal action against Warsaw for not complying with a separate ECJ decision that the country's rules for disciplining judges don't conform with EU law. Brussels said that if the Polish government doesn't respond to the letter of formal notice satisfactorily it will take the case back before the court.

Polish Deputy Justice Minister Sebastian Kaleta hit back at the Commission on social media, tweeting: ""These are acts of aggression. After the approval of the EU budget, the EU bodies have launched an unlawful attack.""

Meanwhile, another deputy justice minister, Marcin Romanowski, tweeted that ""Brussels has launched another unlawful attack at a time when Poland is defending the EU's eastern borders"" ¨C referring to ongoing issues on the border of Poland and Belarus.

Tuesday's announcements from the EU's executive are the latest milestones in a long-running dispute between Warsaw and Brussels over the judges' disciplinary chamber and independence of the entire justice system. Issues around LGBT+ rights and press freedom have also been brought into question by the EU and could lead to funding being withheld from Poland.

The Commission recently warned five Polish regional councils they could lose funding over declarations that they were ""LGBT-free.""

Brussels has also said Warsaw's position that EU law does not stand above national law is holding up the release of more than $65 billion in recovery funding for the country. Hungary and Poland both have until September 15 to respond to other EU legal challenges around each country's treatment of LGBT+ people breaching EU values."

Haibatullah Akhundzada, the supreme leader

Haibatullah Akhundzada was appointed leader of the Taliban in a swift power transition after a U.S. drone strike killed his predecessor, Mullah Akhtar Mansour, in 2016.

Before ascending the movement's ranks, Akhundzada was a low-profile religious figure. He is widely believed to have been selected to serve more as a spiritual figurehead than a military commander.

After being appointed leader, Akhundzada secured a pledge of loyalty from Al-Qaeda chief Ayman al-Zawahiri, who showered the cleric with praise ¨C calling him ""the emir of the faithful."" This helped seal his jihadi credentials with the group's long-time allies.

Akhundzada was tasked with the enormous challenge of unifying a militant movement that briefly fractured during the bitter power struggle after Akhtar's assassination, and the revelation that the leadership had hidden the death of Taliban founder Mullah Omar for years.

Until now, his public profile has largely been limited to the release of messages during Islamic holidays.

""He is present in Kandahar. He has been living there from the very beginning,"" said Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid on Sunday. ""He will soon appear in public,"" added deputy spokesman Bilal Karimi."
"UK's Boris Johnson announces tax rise, admitting it breaks promise","01:00

UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has announced a controversial tax rise to support the UK's pandemic-hit National Health Service (NHS) and fund social care into the future. He has openly admitted it breaks an election promise by his Conservative Party not to raise taxes. But Johnson said he believed voters would understand and that no party knew the pandemic was coming. The announcement is wrapped up with a long-awaited new policy on social care, but it has not put an end to the argument about how that should be paid for. The plan is two-fold, and will increase taxes for the majority of people living in the UK. This revenue will first go to the NHS, which has been hit hard by the pandemic. After three years, the money will be diverted to the social care system. It will also move the burden of the cost from individuals to the government for the poorest, and individuals and the state will share the burden for those with more assets.

What is social care? Social care is assistance in daily life given at home, it's often long-term and it aims to give ""practical support"" to those affected by illness or disability. It has been paid for by those who need treatment, or in some cases by local authorities such as councils. Social care has never been ""free at the point of care,"" like healthcare has been because of the NHS. The burden of social care now rests with local services, but there has always been a significant private sector for long-term care for the old or ill. While the cost of private care has risen, the government funding for social care has actually dropped consistently over the past decade.

The prime minister delivered the policy in a statement to the House of Commons. /PRU/AFP The prime minister delivered the policy in a statement to the House of Commons. /PRU/AFP

What does this plan change? At the moment, anyone with assets (including housing) worth more than $32,033 must pay in full. That means some people end up selling their homes or spending all their savings to pay bills reaching over $100,000. The new rules will mean anyone with less than $27,500 will have costs paid for by the government. Those with between $27,500 and $137,776 will be eligible for some help from the government, but this will be on a ""means tested"" scale, so those with more in the bank will be expected to pay more of a share. There will also be a maximum personal spending bar set at $118,500. That works out at approximately three years of social care. These changes will be paid for with an increase in a tax called National Insurance (NI), which is paid for by everyone aged under 65 who is employed. There will be a 1.24 percent rise on this tax first, before the new contribution is separated and called the Health and Social Care Levy and it is only at this point that pensioners will have to pay, too."

A steaming pot of rice clouded Ahlam Al Khatib's face, her skilled hands tipping it at just the right angle so not a single grain spilled. She has spent most of her life in the kitchen ¨C first in Syria, where she cooked solely for her family, and now in Belgium, where she still cooks at home, but for the first time in her life, also in a restaurant. ""I didn't believe it at first,"" she said. ""I thought it would just be for a few days."" But nearly five years later, she remains one of the chefs at From Syria with Love, a catering restaurant in Antwerp. She is one of four refugee women running the kitchen. Some, like Ahlam, had never worked in the formal sector before, but all are now financial providers for their families.

""When a woman gets financial independence, it's not the financial independence that she gains, but it's the independence,"" said Yara Al Adib, Ahlam's boss and founder of From Syria with Love. ""It's the feeling that I can give back to society or back to my small community as much as any man can."" Before working at the restaurant, Alham and her family survived solely on government aid. But at least they were safe. The months before were harrowing. They fled Homs, Syria amid war and a crashing economy and settled in a refugee camp in Turkey. But after her oldest son died in an accident, it became unbearable.

So we arrived with only the clothes on our backs,"" she recounted with tears in her eyes. Working at From Syria with Love has been a lifeline, not just financially, but also emotionally. ""The best thing is that my kids look up to me now and they ask for things because they know I make money. And I feel very proud that I can give that to them,"" she said.

""Many women struggle to find their voice and their independence. So I thought it would be great if I could help the women who are struggling with that ¨C to use their voice as cooking to speak up."" Empowering refugee women became even more urgent for Yara after the 2016 Brussels terrorist attacks that left 32 people dead. She was struck by an interview with one of the perpetrator's mothers, who spoke about her inability to control her son. ""It kind of hit me. I'm like, 'oh, my God. We could also be like this, Syrian migrants now in Belgium, we could also have kids who turn out to be terrorists because the mother cannot kind of show impact in the home,'"" she said. ""So I thought to myself, 'this is the moment to really empower these mothers because if a mother is empowered, she can empower her son.'"""

UK to extend Northern Ireland Brexit grace period: Frost,"Britain plans to further extend post-Brexit grace periods on some goods imports to Northern Ireland, Brexit minister David Frost said on Monday, in a move designed to give London and Brussels more time for talks about trade with the province.

The fate of British-ruled Northern Ireland was the most contentious issue in Britain's negotiations over its exit from the European Union, which was completed on Dec. 31, and it has continued to cause friction.

To avoid imposing a hard border on the island of Ireland, Britain agreed to leave some EU rules in place in its province of Northern Ireland and accept checks on goods arriving there from elsewhere in the United Kingdom.

London has since said the arrangement is not working and wants it changed, while the EU rejects renegotiating the treaty.

""To provide space for potential further discussions (with the EU), and to give certainty and stability to businesses while any such discussions proceed, the government will continue to operate the protocol on the current basis,"" Frost said in a written ministerial statement.

""This includes the grace periods and easements currently in force,"" he said.

The European Union took note of Britain's plans, but said it was not pursuing further legal steps against London.

""At present, the Commission is not moving to the next stage of the infringement procedure launched in March 2021, and is not opening any new infringements for now,"" the bloc's executive said in a statement.

Officials in London and Brussels have been trying to prevent the dispute from escalating into a full-blown trade war.

The European Commission agreed in July to freeze legal action against Britain for making changes to the protocol that Brussels says breach the Brexit treaty.

London has now indicated it would prolong grace periods, suspending new checks on cross-channel trade due to kick in within weeks.

Ireland is a key player in post-Brexit trade talks and Irish deputy prime minister Leo Varadkar, speaking after a meeting with British Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove, said he expected the British move to lead towards attempts to reach a more permanent solution.

""The expectation is that the United Kingdom will announce a further extension of the grace periods, not just in relation to Northern Ireland but also imports from the EU and Ireland into the UK,"" Varadkar said in an interview with Irish state broadcaster RTE.

""It is important that we use the period of any extension that may occur really to get down to business and to try to put in place more permanent ... arrangements to make sure that the protocol is made more workable,"" Varadkar told RTE.

But Varadkar warned that any more permanent solution secured between London and Brussels would have to be within the confines of the existing agreement.

Varadkar said Gove had told him that Britain ""doesn't want to walk away from the protocol but does want to make it more workable"".

Irish Prime Minister Micheal Martin said last month he believed the issues could be resolved with the right political will."
