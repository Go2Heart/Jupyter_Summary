0,Meet the content creators shaping China's Hanfu revival,"Traditional Chinese clothing is often associated with the qipao (also called the cheongsam) in the West. However, Hanfu – the traditional clothing for Han Chinese, an ethnic group that makes up more than 90 percent of the Chinese population – is valued in China as the authentic form of historical clothing and has been seeing a resurgence in recent years.

According to data from consulting agency iiMedia Research, China's Hanfu market was worth 6.36 billion yuan in 2020. However, with the help of the government's vigorous promotion of traditional culture, capital inflow and increased recognition of ancient fashion, the Hanfu market is expected to exceed a staggering 10 billion yuan in 2021. Young people, especially Gen Zers are the biggest fan base for Hanfu. In 2019, over 50 percent of China's Hanfu wearers were between 19 and 24 years old, followed by those aged 16 to 18, who accounted for 23.16 percent. Meanwhile, Hanfu wearers over 50 years old have the smallest share with only 0.04 percent in 2019. Among all fans, 85 percent of Hanfu are women and only 15 percent are men.

But things are changing this year. According to a report by iiMedia Research, the majority of Hanfu consumers are still predominantly women, who now account for 64.8 percent of the total. But the male fan base is growing, standing at 35.2 percent. Most of them (82.7 percent) hold a bachelor's degree and are getting slightly older as well, although young people are the mainstay. Consumers aged 26-40 account for more than 60 percent followed by those aged 26-30 (36.38 percent). Geographically speaking, 21.15 percent of consumers are located in eastern China, 17.1 percent in the north and 17.1 percent are in the southern part of the country. A little less than half (40.44 percent) live in first-tier cities. At the 17th China International Cartoon & Animation Festival (CICAF), one of the largest events on Asia's animation calendar, in Hangzhou, CGTN spoke with a group of Hanfu models and content creators aged 18 to 77. Liu Weixiu, or Hanfu Grandma, is 77 years old. She used to be a Peking Opera performers but is now focused on her Hanfu modeling career. A collection of pictures of her in Hanfu made her an internet celebrity. At the event, she was accompanied by 18-year-old Chen Jiawei who's been engaged in the industry for almost five years, and has 8 million followers on his social media platforms. During the past year, he's been walking the runway in Hanfu, along with Hanfu Grandma. Together, they portray a grandmother-grandson duo. He also helps the septuagenarian deal with fans, big stages and media.

Shenshang is the stage name of a content creator who was inspired by a verse written by famous poet Du Fu: We have been unable to see each other for so long We have been like morning and evening stars that never meet in the sky She thinks the current popularity of Hanfu culture stems from Chinese people's increasing cultural self-confidence.

Shenshang spends most of her time in Hangzhou and Chengdu, making videos dressed in Hanfu and attending Hanfu catwalk events. She says these two cities are tolerant and people don't judge Hanfu wearers walking on the street.

The increased acceptance of this fashion trend in big cities has been a boon for clothing manufacturers. According to data from iiMedia Research, most stores selling Hanfu outfits are located in Xi'an, Chengdu and Hangzhou. And there are currently more than 3,000 Hanfu companies in the country. According to a consumer survey released earlier this year, 47.5 percent of Hanfu consumers have between two to four sets of outfits. Social media, especially Chinese Twitter-like platform Weibo and Douyin, the Chinese sister app of TikTok, are the channels for nearly 60 percent of consumers to access Hanfu information and become promoters of Hanfu fashion, an important way to popularize the Hanfu culture.

CGTN also spoke to content creator Chen Cuo, who has 1.9 million fans on Weibo. She developed her love for Hanfu when she was very young. As a kid, she liked the costumes in historical dramas and used to wrap herself in bed sheets and pretend she was in a palace. She started taking pictures of herself in Hanfu during high school after seeing other bloggers doing so, and became a promoter of Hanfu herself online.

Statistics show that most Chinese netizens have a positive attitude towards Chinese national quintessence. 68.2 percent of online users believe that traditional Chinese culture should be inherited and promoted. At the same time, the Chinese public has a low level of understanding of Hanfu. The proportion of people who have general knowledge of Hanfu stands at 42.5 percent. Analysts believe that with the gradual popularization of Hanfu culture, widespread understanding of Hanfu will increase, driving the development of Hanfu culture and industry.

Full-time Hanfu model Qingyin told CGTN that she's optimistic about the future of Hanfu. She said Chinese people are increasingly freeing their minds and thinking outside the box. So they are more inclined to accepting traditional arts. In fact, she thinks beautiful things are accepted by everyone.

She also said China's Gen Z is learning about Chinese culture and history through Hanfu. She herself started to learn about interesting history bits from different dynasties because of Hanfu. For example, many people might have stereotypes about some dynasties, but through research she has learned very novel and interesting stories."
1,SAFS director Su Da: We neither repeat ourselves nor imitate others,"04:46

""Animation is a language that brings us closer to the world,"" Su Da, director of the Shanghai Animation Film Studio (SAFS) – the largest animated film producer and one of the oldest animation studios in China, said in an interview with CGTN during the ongoing 17th China International Cartoon & Animation Festival (CICAF). ""The key lies in how we integrate the beauty and essence of our traditional Chinese culture, among other strengths, into the work,"" said the veteran director. Born in Nanjing, east China's Jiangsu Province in 1972, Su began working at the Shanghai studio in the mid-1990s. At the time, she helped with the remake of a number of animation masterpieces such as ""The Monkey King: Uproar in Heaven."" She also created her own signature animated series ""Dear Tutu,"" which became one of the most popular cartoon characters among children since it was first aired in 2004.

Established in 1957, the studio has been led by pioneering animators and artists including Wan Brothers, the founders of the Chinese animation industry and creators of the first Asian animation feature-length film ""Princess Iron Fan"" (1941), as well as Te Wei, who was well-known for such critically acclaimed works as ""Where is Mama"" and ""Feelings of Mountains and Waters,"" featuring ink-wash animation style.

Noting that some of SAFS's classic works in Chinese-style ink-and-wash animation wowed foreign audiences as early as the 1960s, Su said the current team hopes to build on this tremendous legacy. ""Many expressions of Eastern aesthetics are appreciated by overseas audiences,"" she said, adding, ""Fundamentally, in order to gain recognition, we must create work of unparalleled quality and immaculate taste. Our stories should include everyday emotions that resonate and can be shared universally with viewers, and characters must be compelling.""

Using technological innovation to revive classic IPs

According to Su, one thing her studio has been focusing on is to ""concurrently revive past intellectual property while creating new material."" ""Our classics are all cherished household names among viewers who support their revival,"" she said. ""This is another mission for us.""

Two of SAFS's greatest strengths have been traditional two-dimensional animation and ink-and-wash animation, and the studio has produced a series of popular characters and masterpieces such as ""The Deer of Nine Colors,"" ""Calabash Brothers"" and ""Detective Black Cat,"" which have influenced and are still engaging generations of Chinese viewers. However, with the introduction of new technologies, three-dimensional (3D) animation movies have been enjoying increasing popularity. The desire to create high-quality Chinese films that adhere to advanced production standards has led to the new SAFS production of ""Monkey King: Flaming Mountains,"" whose release, as many insiders believed and Su expected, would be ""supremely eye-catching.""

2,Domestic tourism booms during National Day holiday,"Domestic tourism is booming in China during the ongoing National Day holiday between October 1 and 7, known colloquially as ""Golden Week.""

A total of 10.5 million passengers are expected to travel by train, and an additional 640 passenger trains will be added to meet the demand on Sunday, the third day of the weeklong National Day holidays, according to China Railway, the country's railway operator. China's railways handled 11.732 million passengers on October 2, running an additional 917 trains.



In east China's Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, tourists were amazed by performances that featured ancient folk customs. ""I've taken my child here to feel our National Day holiday atmosphere and the charm of ancient Chinese culture,"" said Yang Rui, a tourist.



Some tourists chose to immerse themselves in nature at a time when northern and central China ushers in the year's golden autumn foliage.



Others went paragliding or on hot air balloon rides to survey the magnificent nepheline landforms near Zhangye City in northwest China's Gansu Province.



In Qingzhou County of east China's Shandong Province, elderly tourists enjoyed oceans of flowers at greenhouses that boast 100-plus varieties.



In Shanghai, residents gushed praise for a recently rejuvenated river bank. ""The bank makes it more convenient for us to do physical exercise and have family activities, which has historical significance. The changes are great,"" said Ji Shanshan, a Shanghai resident.



The Ministry of Culture and Tourism and the National Health Commission have reminded tourists to wear masks, wash their hands and maintain social distancing whenever possible."

Following 18 months of restoration, 60 shops in Khan al-Harir, the oldest site in Syria's ancient city of Aleppo, have reopened their doors to shoppers and visitors. Before the conflict in Syria erupted, Khan al-Harir was a vital destination for selling locally made textiles, silk and other kinds of fabrics, which Aleppo was famous for.

""It has a natural look, and we also have a higher rate of work,"" he said. ""The electricity supply is quite good, services as well. They restored the stony walls better than before. They covered the paths with stony tiles, too.""

Mohamad Hamemi is a textile merchant and trader in Khan al-Harir. He remains nostalgic about the old days when the neighboring merchants used to meet and gossip. ""The most memories that relate to markets are when we, the neighbors, used to sit together for a morning coffee and chat about our daily agenda, complain about our concerns,"" he continued. ""We had a simple happy lifestyle."" Hamemi and other merchants hope to regain the losses caused by the destruction. ""Though the markets have reopened to shoppers, more efforts are needed,"" Hamemi said. ""We have to cope and produce as soon as possible to offer our goods and sell them."" He hopes that the small steps they are making will attract more consumers.

6,Interview with 'Balloon' cast: Human experiences in Tibetan context,"05:51

In a Tibetan family struggling to make ends meet, the mother of three finds herself pregnant with a fourth child. What should she do? The dilemma of keeping the baby and risking deeper poverty or aborting at the expense of sinning summarizes the tension between traditional beliefs and modern ideas. This is the premise of ""Balloon,"" the seventh feature of Tibetan filmmaker and author Pema Tseden, which hit cinemas across China on November 20. Set in the late 1990s in the austere but appealing highlands of northwest China's Qinghai Province, the Tibetan picture depicts a bittersweet story centered on three generations of a rural family, whose peaceful yet tough life is repeatedly disturbed by unexpected problems after the children steal the only condoms in the house to blow them up like balloons.

""I was once on the street in Zhongguancun (Beijing's tech hub) and I saw a red balloon floating in the air. I was attracted by the visuals, which were particularly suitable for a film,"" Tseden told CGTN in an interview.

The chance encounter triggered a lightbulb moment for the 51-year-old filmmaker. ""At that moment, I related this image to real Tibetan life, and I thought about a white balloon, which is a key element in this film: the condom,"" he said.

The contraceptive, which the children in the movie discover under their parents' pillow, prompts a series of embarrassing events, lands the family in an uneasy dilemma, and stirs up trouble between wife Drolkar and husband Dargye. Qinghai-born Tseden again turned his lens towards a familiar place – his birthplace – to depict the picturesque views of Qinghai Lake and the daily life of Tibetan shepherds. In his family drama, the filmmaker delves into the religious and traditional culture in which the ethnic group is rooted and explores the conflict between real-life concerns and spiritual ideals.

The lead roles are played by rising Tibetan actors Sonam Wangmo and Jinpa, who collaborated with Tseden on his last title ""Jinpa,"" which bagged the Best Screenplay Award at the 2019 Venice International Film Festival's Horizon section.

Speaking about their third cooperation, Jinpa said there was a tacit understanding with the director and sometimes their rapport did not need words. ""The director didn't say much [on site], but I would just look at him and know what kind of feelings he wants, and then go with it,"" the actor told CGTN. ""Tseden is a very talented director. Many scenes in 'Balloon' were ideas that he came up with before filming or even on location,"" Sonam Wangmo said of her second team-up with the director.

For her powerful performance as a stressed wife and mother in ""Balloon,"" Wangmo won the best actress award at Hainan Island International Film Festival last year and the film pocketed the best feature.

Human elements lead to global acceptance

""Balloon"" made its global premiere in September at last year's Venice International Film Festival before crossing the Atlantic to take part in Toronto International Film Festival. In both events, it enjoyed great popularity and warm reception. ""What impressed me the most was our global premiere in Venice, during one of their largest screening rooms with 3,000 or 4,000 viewers,"" Tseden recalled. ""Many, especially women, said they could relate on a deep level with the film. They stood up to share their feelings, one after another. Many were touched and cried for Drolkar's dilemma about abortion.""

Tibetan actor Jinpa speaks to CGTN. /CGTN Tibetan actor Jinpa speaks to CGTN. /CGTN

""The film is for Tibetan people, but I hope it could be viewed by a wider audience beyond the ethnic group, who could receive it and accept it,"" he said, adding, ""Our hope since the beginning was to create a work that transcends regions and nations.""

""The work I filmed doesn't belong to me,"" Jinpa told CGTN. ""A good work belongs to mankind."" Tseden was the first ethnic Tibetan student to be admitted to the prestigious Beijing Film Academy and the first director to film a movie completely in the Tibetan language in China. Five years after ""Tharlo"" caught international attention, the director is now not only a pioneering filmmaker at home but also a leading voice of Tibetan cinema internationally.

The award-winning filmmaker expressed belief that the rise of Tibetan cinema in recent years has a lot more to do than ethnic exoticism, which originates from a questionable but common belief that ""ethnic uniqueness is a ticket to global acceptance"" in movies."
7,Interview with production team of 'Day Is Done': The power of emotion,"04:28

""A family visit turns into a slow-paced loving farewell between a grandfather and his grandson … Zhang Dalei's rich cinematic language builds a sensitive family portrait that transcends the duration of the short form,"" said the jury statement in its citation for Chinese short film ""Day Is Done,"" which won the Silver Bear Jury Prize at the 71st Berlin International Film Festival in March.



As one of the world's largest film festivals and also one of the European highlights of the cinema industry calendar, the event, also called Berlinale, was held online this year for the first time due to the coronavirus pandemic. The in-person awards ceremony has been tentatively scheduled for June.



The low-key 2021 Berlinale still offered audiences some impressive productions, of which ""Day Is Done"" is one.

Shared emotion between the East and the West

The story of ""Day Is Done"" happened on a normal afternoon, and it's relatively simple: A boy is about to leave home to study abroad. Before leaving, he visits his grandfather who recalls things from the past. But the film doesn't overplay the sadness of this farewell between loved ones.



""The way of showing emotions (in the Orient) is very restrained. It's cumulative and then explosive,"" the director of ""Day Is Done"" Zhang Dalei told CGTN in an interview. ""Unlike in the West, where people communicate directly, emotions for Oriental people are retained for a long time.""

Quoting from Krzysztof Kieslowski, a director Zhang likes, ""Our race is different, and everyone experiences life differently, the difficulties we meet and our emotional expressions are all the same,"" Zhang talked about how his film resonated with audiences from different countries.



""There are cultural differences,"" Zhang said. ""The differences may be modal and historical, but our emotions are all the same. I think this is one of the reasons why my film was well received by the judges.""



""Deep connections can be made, mainly because we focus on emotions,"" Gao Yitian, the producer of ""Day Is Done"" and director of operations of FIRST International Film Festival, told CGTN during the interview. ""When it comes to emotions, regardless of the country or language barriers, you feel the flow of emotions among people.""

Focus on the new generation of Chinese filmmakers

""Prior to 'Day Is Done' and for many years now, we've had different works shortlisted for the Berlin Film Festival. Different Chinese works of all kinds are selected for international film festivals every year,"" Gao said.

FIRST International Film Festival is about to usher in its 15th year, the young festival has been labeled as arthouse, avant-garde and independent. No one would deny that the festival brings groundbreaking but largely unknown films, including the award-winning ""The Coffin in the Mountain"" and documentary ""Four Springs.""



FIRST International Film Festival focuses more on the new generation of Chinese creators and their productions, most of which involve directorial debuts, according to Gao.

""We hope that internationally, more people can see the most current and unique talents of every new generation of creators in China, as well as their stories, images, and the expressions of their lives that are born in China,"" he said.



Zhang and Gao both expressed confidence in the future of China's film market and environment. ""Although there are dark times and heavy losses, the recovery is relatively fast,"" said Gao. ""This is a very good era."""
8,Guan Hu: I'm learning to slow down and find peace in my lows,"04:27

Check any year-end list of 2020's biggest films and you won't miss ""The Eight Hundred."" The Guan Hu-directed war epic was one of the first releases in China after a months-long cinema shutdown because of COVID-19. It scored big on home turf and beyond, raking in a remarkable $468 million to be crowed the No. 1 grossing film of 2020 worldwide. It is the first Chinese-language film to top the global box office, a milestone in an unprecedented era. But for Guan, the hit movie is the realization of a teenage dream to film a war picture after the young man read stories about the Battle of Shanghai in a history book. ""For me, cinema has different functions, like painting and music,"" the 52-year-old veteran filmmaker told CGTN. ""It is a way of life, to ease depression, conquer fear, or fulfill a long-cherished wish, like in the case of 'The Eight Hundred.'"" The $85 million production, based on true events, tells the story of Chinese soldiers defending a warehouse against the invading Japanese army during the Battle of Shanghai in 1937. The title achieved critical and commercial success upon its release on August 21, one month after Chinese cinemas reopened at half-capacity after a six-month lull in operations.

The first major blockbuster of the pandemic era, ""The Eight Hundred"" boosted the recovery of Chinese cinemas, and was credited with the revival of the domestic movie market, which is this year's biggest global box office. Theaters in the country have been operating at a healthy 75% capacity since September. The film's triumph represents a big win for its producers, distributors and Guan himself, who took a risk by releasing the film as the first tentpole to hit cinemas amid the pandemic. The enterprising filmmaker was also among the first to resume work on other movies.

'Relying on creative instinct'

Just two months after the release of ""The Eight Hundred,"" Guan brought to the big screen another war picture, ""The Sacrifice,"" also known as ""Jin Gang Chuan,"" in cooperation with two rising directors Frank Guo (""The Wandering Earth,"" 2019) and Lu Yang (""Brotherhood of Blades,"" 2014).

Director Guan Hu speaks to CGTN /CGTN Director Guan Hu speaks to CGTN /CGTN

The filming of the special effects-driven war picture spotlighting the Chinese People's Volunteers Army began in early August with the three directors working on different parts simultaneously. The movie was released in theaters on October 23 and went on to amass over $171 million, ranking 10th among this year's biggest movies. Noting that the creation course of the film didn't follow the usual rules of production time and techniques, Guan said it was an opportunity to strengthen his will and skills to make ""this miracle."" ""This is an interesting process, during which you are completely relying on your creative instinct,"" he said, adding ""Facing uncertainties and challenges, [you had to] be meticulous about everything.""

Moviemaking needs passion

For the veteran director, working with two other big names on one movie was also a chance to get more inspiration from young talents. ""We are all directors, with different emotions and personalities. So, we could be friends in daily life, but the kind of connection and communication [we had] at work is very rare,"" said Guan of his cooperation with Guo and Lu.

A member of the China Film Director's Guild (CFDG), Guan has been showing support for young filmmakers. He's been on projects by up-and-coming directors, such as ""Reunion Day"" by Gao Linyang, and just last month announced that he will lead the 6th CFDG Young Director Support Program to blaze a trail for young talent. ""Movies belong to young people. Making movies needs passion,"" Guan told CGTN. He expressed the belief that the young generation can be a strong engine in the reboot and recovery of the film industry. ""[Many] have said that the Chinese movie industry has been hit by the COVID-19 pandemic and that we need fresh blood. Haven't they? They refer to this kind of passion,"" he said.

Enjoying peace in highs and lows

Being busy for many years, the filmmaker revealed that he had some restless moments at the beginning of the pandemic when life's pace slowed down. It was an occasion for him to focus on a few small projects that he's been eager to do but had put off for a long time.

As China's National Day holiday approaches, a batch of new films will hit the big screen soon, including the war epic ""The Battle at Lake Changjin"" and star-studded ""My Country, My Parents,"" both on September 30."
13,China's Mid-Autumn holiday box office hits nearly 500 mln yuan,"China's box office raked in over 498 million yuan ($77 million) during this year's Mid-Autumn Festival holiday (September 19-21), according to the data from box office tracking platform Beacon on Wednesday. The figure was 38.18 percent lower than that of the same period in 2019 before COVID-19 struck, hitting its lowest since 2018. Data also shows that nearly 13.4 million movie tickets, including in the pre-sale period, were sold for a record 1.23 million screenings during the three-day holiday, a usually busy period for Chinese cinemas.

Domestic disaster movie ""Cloudy Mountain"" topped this year's Mid-Autumn Festival holiday box office with 214 million yuan in ticket sales, accounting for over 40 percent of the total.

Coming in second with about 73 million yuan in revenue was the family drama ""All About My Mother,"" which debuted on September 19, the first day of the holiday. It was followed by Disney and 20th Century Studios' well-reviewed comedy ""Free Guy."" The video game-based fantasy garnered 53 million yuan during the period.

Hong Kong-set action film ""Raging Fire"" pocketed over 45 million yuan, followed by ""To Be With You,"" a romance movie that also opened on September 19 and grossed some 44 million yuan during the three-day holiday. Takings from the holiday helped China's total box office this year reach over 34.3 billion yuan as of Wednesday, September 22, according to Beacon.

14,"'Stand by me' becomes dark horse, 'Cloudy Mountain' to open","The movie market before the Mid-Autumn Festival is still relatively muted. Despite the release of some new movies, China's box office winner for the week of September 6-12 is still Disney's blockbuster ""Free Guy,"" which crossed 124.67 million yuan ($19.33 million) according to Chinese online movie-ticketing platform Maoyan. After 19 days of its release, ""Free Guy"" has earned a cumulative box office of more than 500 million yuan and a score of 7.8 points out of 10 on Douban, one of the main movie-rating platforms in China. It is well-received as a popcorn movie. ""Free Guy"" is the only Hollywood film to dominate the Chinese box office after the summer break. Released at the end of the summer, it caught the summer holiday as well as the upcoming Mid-Autumn holidays, which gives the film a lot of room to grow at the box office.

In second place was the romance comedy ""Stand by Me,"" which grossed 80 million yuan six days after its release and is very likely to reach the 100 million yuan mark. With its little-known cast and a comparatively small budget, this movie is definitely a box-office dark horse. Before its release, ""Stand by Me"" set off a wave of ""confessions"" on Chinese social networks by virtue of its romantic title. Many netizens expressed their love for their special someone quoting the title of the film. Coming in third with about 63.91 million yuan in ticket sales was ""Raging Fire,"" the final directorial effort by Benny Chan, one of Hong Kong's leading action directors, before his death last August. Sci-fi flick ""The Tomorrow War"" comes in fourth with about 41.14 million yuan while ""Pokemon the Movie: Coco"" followed with 22.02 million yuan.

15,'Free Guy' scores top spot as 'The Tomorrow War' opens soft in China,"Disney and 20th Century Studios' latest blockbuster, ""Free Guy,"" continues to kick butt at China's box office as the sci-fi action flick grossed about 213.2 million yuan ($33 million), scoring the No.1 spot over the past week (August 30–September 5), according to online movie-ticketing platform Maoyan. The well-received and well-reviewed comedy follows a bank teller named Guy who discovers he is a non-player character in an open-world video game ""Free City"" and decides to become the hero of his own story. The video game-based fantasy, starring Ryan Reynolds as the titular role, hit the cinemas nationwide on August 27, earning a 10-day total of $56.6 million. Numerous Chinese moviegoers flocked to the game world in IMAX, scoring the highest IMAX opening weekend indexing in the China market for a new release film in 2021.

The sound performance also makes ""Free Guy"" already the third biggest new Hollywood release in the country this year, following ""F9: The Fast Saga"" and ""Godzilla vs. Kong.""

Coming in second with about 78.7 million yuan in ticket sales was ""Raging Fire,"" the final directorial effort by Benny Chan, one of Hong Kong's leading action directors, before his death last August. Starring celebrated action stars Donnie Yen and Nicholas Tse, the domestic crime action picture, released on July 30, has garnered an impressive 1.14 billion yuan as of Monday. Another sci-fi title, ""The Tomorrow War,"" opened in third place, raking in 52.8 million yuan during its debut weekend. The movie made a theatrical release in China on September 3, two months after premiering on Amazon Prime Video for most of the rest of the world.

The military action picture, starring Chris Pratt, depicts a time-travel story about a mix of present-day soldiers and civilians sent into the future to fight an alien army. It was followed by animated features ""Luca"" and ""White Snake 2: The Tribulation of the Green Snake,"" ranking fourth and fifth with 15.4 million yuan and 14.2 million yuan, respectively.

China's 2021 box office total tops 33 billion yuan

China's 2021 box office revenue totaled over 33 billion yuan as of Monday, September 6. The world's largest movie market has observed a relatively slow summer holiday box office (June-August), around 7.4 billion yuan, due to a Delta variant-driven outbreak emerging in several cities in mid-July.

Much-anticipated war-epic film ""The Battle at Lake Changjin” rocketed to 1.012 billion yuan ($155.12 million) at the Chinese box office on Saturday, just three days after its release on Thursday. With a score of 9.5 out of 10 on China's major movie rating platform Maoyan, the 176-minute movie is proving to be a satisfying pleasure for audiences. It has broken 10 Chinese film history records, including the National Day holiday film single-day box office record, the National Day holiday film opening day screen time record, and the opening day box office record for a war movie.

The battle took place at Lake Changjin area on the eastern front in the second battle of the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea. Three corps of the 9th Corps of the Chinese People's Volunteers Army (CPVA) had a direct contest with the U.S. Army between November 27 to December 24, 1950. The ill-equipped CPVA wiped out an entire world-class equipped regiment of American troops. The epic war is brought to the screen by famous Chinese directors Chen Kaige, Tsui Hark and Dante Lam. The cast also brings together A-listers such as China's leading actors and idols Wu Jing, Jackson Yee, Zhu Yawen, Li Chen, Hu Jun and Duan Yihong.

18,China Pavilion of the Expo 2020 Dubai opens to public,"The China Pavilion at the Expo 2020 Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), officially opened to the public on Friday.

Named ""Light of China,"" the pavilion is shaped like a traditional Chinese lantern. The pavilion is one of the largest at the expo, covering an area of 4,636 square meters.

The pavilion showcases China's latest achievements in the areas of information technology, modern transportation, artificial intelligence, smart living and space exploration, said Zhang Shenfeng, commissioner general of the China Pavilion.

Among the highlights of the China Pavilion are exhibits about the BeiDou Navigation Satellite System, the high-speed railway, the auto-pilot new energy concept car, robots, and the light show at night, he said.

""Because of the pandemic, China's local governments and companies cannot come to the expo park to hold large-scale on-site activities, but we have built an online platform for them to hold events and exchanges,"" Zhang said.

Ni Jian, Chinese ambassador to the UAE, said the China Pavilion showcases the country's remarkable achievements since the reform and opening-up, as well as the great Chinese culture, helping the world to know the country better.

At the expo, 26 provincial-level regions and more than 40 leading Chinese enterprises will hold exhibitions, forums and other activities through online and offline channels. The number of Chinese enterprises participating in the Expo 2020 Dubai surpasses that of any other previous World Expos held outside China.

""Hopefully, the expo will bring opportunities to promote China-Arab economic and trade exchanges, enhance people-to-people communication between China and other countries, and boost economic recovery in the post-pandemic era,"" said Zhang.

Postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Expo 2020 Dubai will be held from October 1, 2021 to March 31, 2022. This is the first time that the World Expo has been staged in the Middle East, North Africa and South Asia.

25,Syria's traditional industries and artists are vanishing,"Hamada Jad-al-Sayed handcrafting copper in his workshop in Damascus, Syria. CGTN Hamada Jad-al-Sayed handcrafting copper in his workshop in Damascus, Syria. CGTN

Craftsmen in Syria are struggling to hang on amid a decade of war, economic hardships and an absence of tourists who used to come from abroad, as well as the country's dependence on tourists from Iran, Iraq and Lebanon, whose movements have been affected by the economic crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic. Meanwhile, traditional handcrafts are facing the threat of extinction.

Hamada Jad-al-Sayed is one of few remaining young craftsmen who work with copper inlaid with silver in the ancient city sector of Syrian capital Damascus. ""There is no demand for handcrafts like before, because the products were depending on tourism as the main market. We used to sell our products very quickly before the war, nowadays we barely sell one-tenth of our products,"" he said. ""This situation doesn't encourage the new generations to learn these handcrafts. This generation knows that the production process is slow and there are very few sales; I understand them.""

Hamada sits in his small workshop, knocking the copper carefully, introducing us to traditional handcrafts that were known in Damascus hundreds of years ago and how they reflect the culture of Islam and the city. He hopes the following generations continue the tradition.

Hisham al-Halabi, a craftsman who creates wood products inlaid with seashells, known as ""arabesque,"" works in the ancient site of Tekiya Sulaymaniyah in Damascus where a souk is located. He said the price of essentials and raw materials has hiked, depriving Syrians, whose average income is $25 per month, of being able to afford these products. ""Raw materials are overpriced because we use seashells, which we import due to a lack of local materials in Tartous and Latakia,"" he said. ""Wood also became expensive due to the exchange rate, in addition to diesel costs and labor wages as well as the transporting high cost; it all affected this craft.""

26,'Worn Out' – Dutch museum finds Van Gogh drawing of tired old man,"A Dutch museum on Thursday unveiled a previously unknown work by Vincent van Gogh – a study for one of his best-known drawings, ""Worn Out"" – in which an old man sits in a chair with his head in his hands. Van Gogh ""was really interested in the ordinary person, he was also looking to express emotion,"" said Van Gogh Museum Director Emilie Gordenker. ""I think we're all coming out of the COVID-19 period feeling like this and the amazing thing is that we can share this with our visitors. We're open, we're delighted to be open.""

Discoveries of works by the famously troubled artist, who died in 1890, are extremely rare. The drawing is owned by a private collector and had never been known of or displayed.

""So when (the owner) came to the museum it was a big surprise,"" said Senior Researcher Teio Meenendorp, adding that the piece was relatively easy to authenticate. The 50 x 30 cm (20 x 12 inch) work was done with Van Gogh's favorite drawing tool, a carpenter's pencil, in his distinctive style, on watermarked paper from 1877. It closely resembles the more famous ""Old Man"" drawing, but the perspective is at eye-level with the old man, rather than from above. The work can be dated with unusual precision to the last weeks of November 1882, Meenendorp said, because of two letters Van Gogh wrote on November 24 of that year. It was a period of relative stability for the artist while he was living with a woman in The Hague.

One letter was to his brother Theo, saying he had made two drawings of ""an old man with his elbows on his knees and his head in his hands"" and that he was thinking of making it into a lithograph.

""What a fine sight an old working man makes, in his patched bombazine suit with his bald head,"" Vincent wrote. The other letter was to a fellow artist, saying with confidence he planned to make a lithograph of the theme. Van Gogh did make the lithograph, titled ""At Eternity's Gate"", three days later, on November 27, 1882.

Meenendorp said Van Gogh had given the works English titles partly in hopes his drawings might be noticed and lead to a job for him as an illustrator for a magazine. That never happened. Van Gogh had little commercial success while he was alive, though he won great acclaim later. The Dutch artist was troubled by mental illness and considered himself a failure. He returned to the theme with an oil painting known as ""Sorrowing Old Man"", based on the lithograph, two months before his own death. Van Gogh died on July 29, 1890, of a self-inflicted gun wound.

27,Australia announces recognition of Sinovac's COVID-19 vaccine,"Australia has officially listed a COVID-19 vaccine developed by Chinese pharmaceutical company Sinovac as a ""recognized vaccine"" on Friday after completing its assessment of the jab.

The Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) said in its advice on the recognition of COVID-19 vaccines used globally but not registered in Australia that the Chinese vaccine demonstrated a 64 percent average efficacy against symptomatic infection and 90 percent against hospitalization.

The inclusion of Sinovac's shot as a recognized vaccine in Australia would mean that over 80,000 Chinese international students will be allowed to study in the country when it reopens its international borders from November, according to the Sydney Morning Herald newspaper.

""This is enormously welcome news which means valued international students can return safely and promptly. It also means a very important first step in reviving international education which of course contributes more than $31 billion to the Australian economy,"" Universities Australia chief executive Catriona Jackson said.

Considering that China has provided hundreds of millions of COVID-19 vaccine doses to countries in Southeast Asia, the move would also imply international travelers from Southeast Asia could be able to enter Australia.

Australia's international border was expected to open from November on a state-by-state basis as they reach the 80 percent vaccination threshold according to Australia's Prime Minister Scott Morrison."
28,"COVID-19 creates dire U.S. shortage of teachers, school staff","Several schools nationwide have had to shut classrooms because of a lack of teachers. In Michigan, Eastpointe Community Schools abruptly moved its middle school back to remote learning this week because it doesn't have enough teachers. The small district north of Detroit has 43 positions vacant — a quarter of its teaching staff. When several middle school teachers resigned without notice last week, the district shifted to online classes to avoid sending in unqualified substitutes, spokeswoman Caitlyn Kienitz said. ""You don't want just an adult who can pass a background check, you want a teacher in front of your kids,"" Kienitz said. ""This is obviously not ideal, but we're able to make sure they're getting each subject area from a teacher certified to teach it."" According to a June survey of 2,690 members of the National Education Association, 32% said the pandemic drove them to plan to leave the profession earlier than expected. Another survey by the RAND Corp. said the pandemic exacerbated attrition, burnout and stress on teachers, who were almost twice as likely as other employed adults to feel frequent job-related stress and almost three times more likely to experience depression. The lack of teachers is ""really a nationwide issue and definitely a statewide issue,"" said Linda Darling-Hammond, president of California's State Board of Education. A school district in California's West Contra Costa County is considering hiring out-of-state math educators to teach online while a substitute monitors students in person.

""This is the most acute shortage of labor we have ever had,"" associate superintendent Tony Wold said. ""We opened this year with 50 – that's five-zero – teaching positions open. That means students are going to 50 classrooms that do not have a permanent teacher.""



There are an additional 100 openings for non-credentialed but critical staff like instructional aides – who help English learners and special needs students – custodians, cafeteria workers and others, Wold said.



California's largest district, Los Angeles Unified with 600,000 students, has more than 500 teacher vacancies, a fivefold increase from previous years, spokeswoman Shannon Haber said.



Schools try to fill in with substitutes, but they're in short supply, too. Only about a quarter of the pool of 1,000 qualified substitutes is willing to work in Fresno Unified, said Nikki Henry, a spokeswoman for the central California district with 70,000 students and 12,000 staffers.



At Berkeley High School, a shortage of substitutes means teachers are asked to fill in during their prep periods, leading to exhaustion and burnout typically not felt at the start of a school year.



""We are absolutely strained. This has been an incredibly stressful start to the year,"" said Hasmig Minassian, a ninth-grade teacher who describes physical and mental exhaustion as she tries to juggle staffing needs and the emotional needs of students who are showing signs of more mental fragility and learning loss.



""It doesn't feel like there are enough adults on these campuses to keep kids really safe. We feel short-staffed in a way we've never felt before,"" she said.



The California shortages range from dire to less severe in places that planned ahead and beat the competition, but those are the minority, said Darling-Hammond of the board of education.



In a new twist, money is not the main problem. School districts have the funds to hire additional staff, thanks to billions in federal and state pandemic relief funding. There just aren't people applying.



""We're all competing for a shrinking piece of the pie,"" said Mike Ghelber, assistant superintendent at the Morongo Unified School District in the Mojave Desert, which has more than 200 openings for special education aides, custodians, cafeteria workers and others. ""I don't know if everybody is getting snatched up, or if they don't want to teach in the COVID era, but it's like the well has dried up.""



The district of 8,000 students has ads in newspapers, radio and social media. Teachers are packing ""now hiring"" flyers into kids' lunchboxes, with a long list of openings so families can spread the word. In the meantime, everyone is pitching in.



""Principals and administrators are out being crossing guards. Secretaries are directing traffic because we're short on supervisors,"" Ghelber said.



The shortages raise concerns that schools will hire underqualified teachers, particularly in low-income communities where it’s already harder to fill positions, Darling-Hammond said.



Class sizes also are expanding.



Mount Diablo Unified School District, which serves 28,000 students east of San Francisco, has had to fill several elementary school classrooms at the maximum capacity of 32 students. It's not ideal for social distancing but frees up teachers for online school.



About 150 kids initially signed up for distance learning, but with spiking infections blamed on the highly contagious delta variant, the number ballooned to 600 when school reopened. The same happened in Fresno, where enrollment in remote learning exploded to 3,800 from 450.



Superintendent Adam Clark said the Mount Diablo district is offering $5,000 signing bonuses for speech pathologists and $1,500 for paraeducators who help students with learning needs.



San Francisco Unified is offering a similar starting bonus for 100 paraeducator jobs. Nearby West Contra Costa County Unified has set $6,000 signing bonuses for teachers, with a third paid out after the first month and rest when the teacher enters year three.



Districts in Oklahoma, North Carolina, New Jersey and elsewhere are offering a range of cash incentives for new teachers, particularly in low-income and low-performing schools.



Of a dozen officials interviewed in California districts, only one said it was facing no shortages.



Long Beach Unified, the state's fourth-largest district with over 70,000 students, anticipated the need last spring for a hiring spree of about 400 jobs.



""We went full aggressive,"" assistant superintendent David Zaid said, including beefing up human resources for a 24-hour turnaround on contract offers.



A virtual interview team worked through the summer. Recruitment events drew hundreds of applicants, and as HR employees met hiring benchmarks, they got rewards like catered breakfasts and an ice cream truck.



""We probably would have experienced the same shortages as others,"" Zaid said. ""But we became much more assertive, and as a result, we are not in the same position."""
29,China strengthens crackdown on irregular off-campus tutoring,"China has pledged stern actions against irregular off-campus tutoring activities featuring curriculum subjects.

Unlicensed institutions and individuals offering backdoor curriculum subject-tutoring services, such as household services and consulting, will be investigated and handled in accordance with the related law and regulations, according to a circular issued by the Ministry of Education on Wednesday.

The document also clarifies other types of irregularities in off-campus curriculum subject-tutoring activities, including those violating regulations on who can provide such services as well as when, where and how such services can be provided.

Meanwhile, primary and secondary school teachers are banned from being paid for offering extra lessons after class, the circular says.

It also bans conducting tutoring of core school subjects under the disguise of summer camps or training of art, sports, science and technology, adding that offline institutions cannot provide such services through online channels, such as livestreaming and online conferencing.

China's Ministry of Education (MOE) on Friday asked schools to strengthen health monitoring of their students and faculty members before the beginning of the fall semester.

Schools are not permitted to begin classes if they fail to meet local COVID-19 control standards or if they are not fully prepared for an emergency, the ministry said at a press conference.

Schools in areas that are at high or medium risk for COVID-19 should postpone the start of the new semester.

Students and teachers who have been to high- or medium-risk areas should delay their return to school, the MOE said.

Students, faculty members and other staff of higher education institutions are required to show negative results of nucleic acid tests taken within 48 hours of their return from vacation, it said.

A COVID-19 control plan for schools that was recently issued by the MOE and the National Health Commission has required students at higher education institutions to wear masks on campus.

Primary and middle school students in low-risk areas and children in kindergartens do not have to wear masks in class, the document said."

32,Can cultural exchange mend the gap between China and the U.S.?,"Hogwarts castle light show at the Universal Studio Beijing Resort. /VCG Hogwarts castle light show at the Universal Studio Beijing Resort. /VCG

Amid the pandemic and the ongoing tensions between China and the United States, Universal Beijing Resort, the fifth and the largest Universal theme park, is the latest hit in the metropolis from across the Pacific. Universal Beijing Resort opened on September 20 after repeated delays. When pre-sales of tickets started a week earlier, all one million were sold within three minutes. The park features themes from major film franchises such as the Transformers and Harry Potter series, which young generations of Chinese grew up watching. The overwhelming success of the park's opening proves American pop culture icons' impact on Chinese millennials and Gen Zers, who now make up the bulk of China's burgeoning middle-class.

Global Times said, ""This is a rare time in a long while when an America-themed topic has attracted such obvious and widespread praise in China."" Qin Gang, China's newly appointed ambassador to the United States, saw his coaster ride at the Universal as a metaphor for the two countries' relations: ""After all the tumbling and shakes, the rollercoaster came to a soft landing in the end."" Director of the John L. Thornton China Center of the Brookings Institution, Li Cheng, has long argued that people-to-people connection is the most essential foundation of China-U.S. relations. ""We put too much emphasis on the state-to-state relationship between China and the U.S., and often forget that China-U.S. relations also depend on non-governmental relationships – the people-to-people relationship."" A perfect example of such a relationship was formed by Yao Ming – the renowned Chinese basketball player who played for the Houston Rockets in the NBA. Yao's career in the NBA was phenomenal. In addition to his prowess as a basketball player, his charm and humor was a bonus that made the ancient civilization more relatable to average Americans. For Li, Yao is ""a cultural ambassador in its truest sense."" In 2014, Li invited Yao to speak at the Brookings Institution about how basketball brings Chinese and Americans together. Also invited to the event was former NBA commissioner David Stern. According to Li, Stern shared a story about the 2.26-meter-tall star that he remembers very well. He once invited Yao to lunch, and Yao left him a thank you note after. This act impressed Stern because it was an American etiquette. As Stern recalled, Yao was the only player who wrote him a thank you note among all the players in the league he dined with. ""This is just a small example that speaks to Yao Ming's cultural sensitivity,"" Li said, ""which is why he is a link that ties us together."" Thanks to Yao, Chinese fans were introduced to American basketball. Now, the NBA has an audience of more than 500 million in China. The NBA saw the potential in China's market and worked to keep a close partnership with China by organizing commercial and charity events to promote the sport to the younger generation. For a long time, the NBA has served as a bridge of cultural exchange between China and the United States. Among all the NBA superstars that made annual visits to China in the off-seasons, the late NBA legend Kobe Bryant was the most celebrated player by Chinese fans.

When Kobe Bryant and his daughter Gianna's tragic accident happened on January 26, 2020, the novel coronavirus outbreak in China was at its peak. However, the news about Bryant's fatal accident soon surpassed the virus and dominated Weibo's top searches. On January 27, Bryant's death occupied three of the top five most searched hashtags on Weibo. The most searched tag, ""Kobe passed away,"" had more than 10 million searches – four times more than ""latest pandemic map,"" which ranked fifth. Even People's Daily, a Chinese state media outlet, joined in mourning for Bryant and his daughter. ""His fearless spirit of fighting, both on the court and in real life, is worth remembering,"" People's Daily wrote on Weibo. It is worth noting that at the time, the NBA was still banned in China following Houston Rockets' general manager Daryl Morey's tweet on Hong Kong in October 2019. This was the first time China's state media posted any NBA associated content since, which spoke volumes for the weight Bryant carried in China. ""During a time of intense political and ideological conflict, Kobe Bryant's legacy in China challenges the conventional wisdom that Chinese youth are simply 'brainwashed' by anti-American propaganda, which could foment a cultural clash between China and the United States. This connection, exemplified by Kobe's interaction with the Chinese people on a personal level, has been an important foundation for U.S.-China relations over the past four decades,"" Li wrote in his article, ""Kobe Bryant and his enduring impact on the Sino-American friendship."" Teng Jimeng, professor of American studies at Beijing Foreign Studies University, has been teaching Chinese film history to American exchange students for 20 years. Teng told CGTN that the film most widely liked by his foreign students was ""Assembly,"" a Chinese war film telling a PLA veteran's fight to gain recognition for his comrades who died nameless in the People's War of Liberation. ""The most touching part is the story itself, which is cross-cultural and universal. The protagonist Gu Zidi fought for the title of martyr for all his soldiers. This incurred a common response among my American students. Some said, this is a very typical American story: the dignity, rights, and reputation of an individual shall not be deprived of."" From cultural exchanges, we can find common humanity, no matter who you are or where you're from.

As China-U.S. relations in the Biden-era continue to struggle, cultural and people-to-people exchanges have become a necessary channel to keep the foundations strong. ""The bonds of our cultures, and the genuine friendship between our people will stand the test of time. They should be the main drive force of China-U.S. relations, not the economy, and not the so-called strategic framework and so on,"" Li said. In fact, Joe Biden shares a close relationship with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Back when they were both vice presidents in 2011, they formed a friendship when Biden visited Beijing and Chengdu. The two have met at least 11 times in person since then. During Xi's visit to the U.S. in 2015, he spoke at a luncheon hosted by then Vice President Joe Biden and then Secretary of State John Kerry. ""Heart-to-heart communication between our two peoples is the source of strength of our bilateral ties. The growth of China-U.S. relations won't be possible without the mutual understanding and support of our people,” said Xi. Although China-U.S. relations have deteriorated to their lowest point in their half-a-century relationship, the foundation built on cultural exchange still stands, and there is still enough goodwill for the two countries to mend frayed ties and peacefully coexist."

The most common way to cook sweet potatoes is to steam and roast them. These methods of cooking sweet potatoes are convenient and quick, and the flavor of sweet potatoes can be preserved. To give the sweet potatoes a more layered flavor, match them with other ingredients along with a dipping sauce.

During the period of “Chu Shu,” the temperature difference between day and night increases as the summer heat hasn’t totally retreated while the autumn coolness has already fallen.

During this transition in temperature and dry season, it’s recommended that people eat foods helpful for protecting the stomach and moistening the lung.

Tremella Lily Lotus Seed Soup (“Yin Er Bai He Lian Zi Tang” in Chinese) is definitely one of the best choices.

According to traditional Chinese medicine, white tremella (Yin Er) and lily bulb (Bai He) both have moisturizing functions, while lotus seed has drying properties. Modern nutrition research states that they are rich in vitamins and protein. Chinese people have a long history of combining them in order to reduce excessive heat in the body, calm nerves and provide nutrition.

As the sun rises higher during the hottest hours, the mercury rises to its peak. Adding a musical touch is the background chorus of the cicadas. The searing weather and the sweet noise mark the advent of ""Major Heat,"" or ""Dashu"" in Chinese, the 12th solar term of the traditional Chinese lunar calendar. Major Heat, which begins on July 23 this year, will end on August 8. As the sweltering heat grips most parts of China, Major Heat symbolizes the second phase of the Sanfu days – the hottest period of the year.

During this period, coastal areas are more prone to natural calamities like typhoons, while some regions are more likely to reel under drought-like situations as many others face an increased risk of flooding and erosion. But abundant sunshine and rainfall also spells a boost for the forthcoming harvest. For farmers living in southern China, it is a crucial time for gathering their ripe crops from the field, beginning another round of direct seeding and transplanting rice seedlings.

Best foods to keep cool this summer!

It is vital to make necessary dietary changes according to the season, especially during the ""dog days"" when you easily feel lethargic and struggle with lack of concentration at work as hot and humid weather causes loss of appetite and sleeping disorders.

Litchi is a popular fruit during Major Heat. /VCG Photo Litchi is a popular fruit during Major Heat. /VCG Photo

Extreme heatwave can pose serious heath risks including dehydration, skin sensitivities, fever and heat stroke. During Major Heat, your body needs foods that contain more water to replenish the fluids lost from sweating. Juicy fruits and vegetables such as strawberries, orange, grapes, melons, cucumber and leafy greens like Chinese cabbage score highly in this regard.

Foods with mild and gentle tastes like pumpkin and honey are great appetite boosters, which also help nourish our heat-stricken digestive system. Litchi, full of glucose and vitamins, is a popular choice. According to Traditional Chinese Medicine, eating litchi during this period is as nourishing as eating ginseng – a herbal supplement that is often regarded as the king of all herbs. Drinking some tea and eating cool desserts, prepared using natural ingredients such as herbs, fruit, and flowers, can help your body cool off and avoid heat-related health issues.

Low on calories and high on moisture, grass jelly is a common feature in many beverages like milk tea and desserts on hot summer days due to its soothing and cooling effects.

Grass jelly is a black jelly-like substance that has a mild and slightly bitter taste. It can also relieve a burned tongue and heal a sore throat. It derives from Platostoma palustre plant – a member of the mint family that is also known as ""Chinese mesona"" – and is overwhelmingly popular in southern China, such as in Fujian, Guangdong and Taiwan.

There were some controversies about the beginnings and the origins of Chinese civilization. However, once you see the archaeological evidence in Liangzhu Ancient City with your eyes, you would be in no doubt about this long history.

The ruins of what was once the thriving capital of Liangzhu were included on the World Heritage List at the 43rd session of the UNESCO World Heritage Committee in Azerbaijan, China's 55th site on the list.

40,Tomb of Nanyue King: Discovering precious items and imported goods,"04:19

As a person who grew up in northern China, my impression towards Guangzhou City, one of the largest southeast cities in China, was all from internet and weather reports. Hot and humid, it is the typical description for coastal cities in China, including Guangzhou. Guangzhou is the birthplace for the ancient maritime silk route, connecting China with foreign countries by ships. In the past, Guangzhou was called Panyu, the capital of Nanyue Kingdom.

In contrast to other tombs located far from the city center, the Nanyue King tomb was discovered in downtown Guangzhou in 1983. The Nanyue King museum, which houses the tomb, was built in the same location next to a busy street. This tomb from the Han Dynasty is the oldest and largest Han tomb with the most burial objects in Lingnan (South of the Nanling Mountain).

The Nanyue King tomb belonged to the second king of Nanyue, Zhao Mo, who ruled from 137 BC to 122 BC. Compared to other luxury tombs, the Nanyue King tomb unearthed more than 1,000 burial objects; many of them rare treasures with exotic cultural characteristics.

The administrative seal of emperor Wen is one of such rare items. Emperor seals are typically made from jade and are large and heavy. The tiny, but delicate, seal is made from pure gold. It was the earliest seal with dragon a knob found. A lot of the relics can be traced back to foreign countries of that time. The patterns on ornaments have the strong characteristics of Mesopotamian culture. Even at that time, people had the concept of combining exotic foreign styles with local culture.

The Tomb of Nanyue King of Western Han Dynasty unveiled the impact of the ancient maritime silk route. All the burial objects are extremely rare and precious, which combine culture from different regions and countries. Whether as Panyu in ancient past or as Guangzhou in today's world, this city located near the sea has greatly taken advantage of its geographical location by building international networks throughout time."
41,Sanxingdui Site: A mysterious costume party with masks from the past,"""Are they aliens?"" – That was my first impression when I saw weird masks of different sizes floating in a big display room at Sanxingdui Museum in southwest China's Sichuan Province. Their ears resembled those of elves, their eyes in cylindrical or triangular shapes.

Sanxingdui translates into ""Three-Star Piles."" It is a cultural relic from the ancient Shu Kingdom. The name refers to the three earth mounds at the eponymous site, whose discovery attracted international attention and rewrote the history of Chinese civilization.

These masks were unearthed from sacrificial pits, were archaeologists also found decorative animals including dragons and snakes, a giant wand, and sacrificial altars.

But these large bronze masks with angular human features, including exaggerated triangle-shaped eyes, big noses, and huge ears, do not reflect how Asian people look."
42,An ancient 'slash worker': Marquis Yi of Zeng and his alter ego,"04:54

The clanging sound of swords clashing was not music to the ears of a Chinese king during the Warring States period (475 B.C. – 221 B.C.). At a time of bloodshed and violence, Marquis Yi of Zeng found peace in the gentle ring of chimes. New York Times author Marci Alboher coined the term ""slash career"" to describe the people in modern time who have a steady income from different careers. In central China's Hubei Province, I came across arguably the oldest ""slash worker"" who lived during the Warring States period. He is thought to be a king of one of the states at war. His tomb, discovered in Suizhou City of central China's Hubei Province in 1978, is noteworthy because it was built using thick tree trunks. Each burial chamber is square-shaped.

The Tomb of Marquis Yi of Zeng in Suizhou City of central China's Hubei Province. /CGTN Photo The Tomb of Marquis Yi of Zeng in Suizhou City of central China's Hubei Province. /CGTN Photo

When the tomb was excavated, a number of coffins were found floating in underground water. One coffin housed the remains of a male in his mid-forties. It was that of Marquis Yi of Zeng. The remaining 21 caskets all belonged to women, aged between 13 and 25. Once the water was drained, an astonishing collection of musical instruments revealed itself to the world. The most famous one is a giant chime, which weighs nearly five tons. It is a percussion instrument, called ""bianzhong"" or ""chime bells,"" consisting of a set of bronze bells of different sizes and pitch sequences. It's the best preserved chime set, with the most bells. Among the 21 buried women, eight were in the same chamber with the owner, so experts believe they were his wives. The other 13 were found in a separate chamber next to the instruments and are believed to be musicians.

Historical records show that Marquis Yi of Zeng was into making musical instruments and researching about music — a musician of sorts. I got the chance to play a replica of the instrument at Hubei Provincial Museum. Each bell can make two different sounds when tapped in different locations. I somehow managed to play ""Ode of Joy"" with the 2,400-year-old instrument. In the tomb, archaeologists also discovered a considerable number of ritual and drinking vessels. They are the most refined I have ever seen during any of my archaeological trips. Their peculiar shapes, perfect craftsmanship, and gorgeous decoration showed advanced smelting techniques at such an early time.

Half of the burial objects were weapons, and the expansive collection of rare weapon types suggests that Marquis Yi of Zeng was a great strategist as well. Living in an era when wars were a daily occurrence, Marquis Yi of Zeng seemed to have found peace in diversifying his interests, switching between a strategist and a musician."
43,Xinjiang's ethnic diversity fosters a strong sense of community,"Xinjiang is one of the most diverse regions of China. While lately, for several reasons, there has been a constant international focus on the Uygurs, who form the largest ethnic group in the autonomous region, Xinjiang is in fact home to more than 50 ethnic groups.

From the time of the Ancient Silk Road over the past two millennia, religious and cultural interactions between these ethnic groups have produced Xinjiang's unique multicultural identity.

In many ways, Xinjiang's various ethnic groups reflect the ""strong sense of community"" that was highlighted by Chinese President Xi Jinping as he appealed for equality and unity among ethnic groups in China at last month's Central Conference on Ethnic Affairs.

""First of all, I am a Chinese national, and then comes my Uygur identity, which is among the 56 ethnic groups of the Chinese nation. All 56 ethnic groups are members of our family, and we are part of this family,"" Razia Mamat, a 30-year-old Uygur woman asserted at the CGTN Roundtable held recently at a historic 100-year-old tea house in Kashgar Ancient City.

Mamat's sentiments were echoed by her fellow panelists at the roundtable. ""We are united as a big family,"" stressed Wei Yun, a 50-year-old woman representing the Han community. ""All the ethnic groups live in harmony,"" concurred Abduwahap Helil, a 75-year-old Uzbek resident of Kashgar.

Preserving language, culture and tradition

To maintain such harmony, preservation and continuation of language, culture and tradition of minority ethnic groups are the key and in Xinjiang, this element is most abundantly on display.

""In schools, Uygur language and Mandarin are taught at the same time. So, we can speak Uygur or Mandarin with our Uygur compatriots in our daily life,"" Mamat remarked.

""I can use our Uzbek language, Mandarin or Uygur language to communicate,"" quipped Helil. ""We also sing and dance to our own folk music,"" he added.

Helil noted that each community carries out social events such as weddings and funerals in accordance with their respective customs and rituals. ""Our cultural traditions are perfectly preserved and it makes me happy,"" he said. ""At the same time, we live in a constantly developing society, so we actively absorb some excellent modern culture to enrich our culture,"" Helil added philosophically.

Festivals, social interactions and intermarriages

Despite their distinctive cultures, members of the various ethnic communities interact and participate actively in each other's festivals and social activities.

""For example, during the festivals of various ethnic groups, we hold some activities, and then let all ethnic groups participate and experience the culture of other ethnic groups,"" Mamat said. ""So, people can communicate and interact with each other and then feel the culture of others.""

Helil concurred. ""The Corban festival (Eid-al-Adha) is the most popular among Uzbeks. During the festival, Uzbek, Uygur, Han and other ethnic groups celebrate together. Rozi Day (Eid-al-Fitr) is also one of our traditional festivals, which is also celebrated by Uzbeks and other ethnic groups,"" he elucidated.

""When we celebrate these festivals, all ethnic groups are together, including the people of the Han community. Other ethnic minorities also celebrate the Spring Festival with Hans,"" added Wei.

According to Wei, intermarriages between people from different ethnic backgrounds are also increasingly becoming relatively common. ""At these wedding ceremonies, many people of different ethnicities come together. When different ethnic groups intermarry, there are basically people of various ethnic minorities celebrating together.""

'A strong sense of well-being'

Owing to China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) which aims to revive Xinjiang's ancient role as a major trading hub between China and Central Asia, the region has witnessed rapid economic progress in recent years. This has substantially improved the lives of many in and around the cities of Kashgar, Urumqi, Hotan and Turpan.

When asked to respond on how the BRI-linked initiatives have affected the lives of common people, the roundtable panelists cited the improved living conditions in Xinjiang and praised the government and the Communist Party of China for these welcome changes in unison.

""Thanks to the Party and the government, there are obvious changes in the development and transformation of the Ancient City. And we are deeply impressed by environmental sanitation. We are grateful to the Party and government for giving this good environment, so that we can improve our businesses,"" Wei said.

""The Party has done a good job in promoting economic development. That is why the economic situation of ethnic minorities, including Uzbeks, has improved over the years. We enjoy many good policies of the country,"" said Helil, adding that his own family business has reaped the benefits of progress.

Mamat nodded in agreement. ""Everyone is equally enjoying the policies enjoyed by all ethnic groups. Regardless of life, education, medical and health care, they all enjoy these policies that benefit the people of the country.""

""While fully preserving this culture, we are also encouraging everyone to participate in the transformation of the Ancient City, which is equivalent to providing a lot of employment and entrepreneurial positions,"" she elucidated.

""Through these policies for the benefit of the people, the living conditions of the residents are constantly improving, and their sense of well-being is very strong,"" Mamat remarked.

'Western allegations are ridiculous'

The panelists also rubbished the Western allegations of human rights violations, including claims of forced labor in the cotton industry, in Xinjiang.

""They are just slandering our country. They don't like the fact that our country is developing very fast, and we are very happy. They are not familiar with the situations here. Moreover, our Xinjiang cotton production is all mechanized, and the sales help us increase our incomes and improve our living standards,"" remarked Helil.

""The Western allegations on human rights here are ridiculous. We are now living in nice apartments and houses, we are living a good life, and life is very happy. If they don't believe it, they can come and see for themselves. They shouldn't just sit there and make up such unrealistic remarks,"" said Mamat.

She too emphasized that modern agricultural practices in Xinjiang excludes any such manual labor that could be considered ""forced."" Moreover, ""everyone has their own choices for employment and entrepreneurship. No one forces them to grow cotton,"" she added.

Stating that Western claims on Xinjiang are not only unrealistic but also malicious, Wei concluded: ""We believe that evil does not suppress righteousness.""

45,She Power on Chongming Island: How handicrafts transform life,"Four years ago, Song Rongyao from Shanghai's Chongming Island finally made the decision to quit her job as an accountant at an office where she had worked for 10 years.

The 37-year-old mother quit not because she absolutely hated her job.

She quit because her job was getting in the way of her true passion.

For seven years before handing in her resignation letter, Song had been using her after-work time to design, sew and weave – everything you need to make something with your own hands.

She was drawn by a wedding necessity and piece of cultural heritage on the island: Chongming traditional fabric, made from cotton and colored with plant dyes.

""My last job left me with some extra time after work, so I started to dig into handicrafts and grew more and more fond of it. Because when the things you make are liked by others, you'll find yourself enjoying doing it more and more,"" Song said.

Initially, the small items she made, a cup mat or a mouse pad, became a hit in the office, to a point that they often got snatched away by her colleagues.

Later, her name spread and she soon discovered that many women on the island were like her – also into handicrafts.

Her childhood playmates joined her. Friends from the same village came knocking on her door. Strangers tried to reach her over the phone.

But like anywhere else on the planet, women in Chongming find themselves entangled in all kinds of responsibilities: raising a child, attending to aging parents, caring for a husband, and working, to name just a few.

""When my child was too little, I had to find a home-based job, and as he grows older, I can allow myself to finally go out and do something that I enjoy,"" said 40-year-old Wei Mei, a handicraft teacher and mother of one.

Song understands all that. She adopts a flexible working schedule that sets no rules on working hours, which has become very friendly to these women.

A turning point came when Song and her team were holding a small exhibition in a park and a crowd of curious people surrounded them, eager to know what they were doing.

Not long after that, she decided to make it official: Cotton-Tree Flowers Bloom Workshop was founded in 2013.

The 300-square-meter workshop, refitted from a rented warehouse, became a place full of happiness. By designing and making all kinds of cloth items and selling them, the women have found a moment of escape and a sense of accomplishment. They also have found a place to progress together from students to teachers.

Their lives have been changed.

""The family chores every day would spare you no time to think, but later after I joined here, I started to think again, and that really changes things,"" said Lu Mei, a 42-year-old handicraft teacher, tea art specialist and mother of one.

""To learn from Song, and sew all kinds of flowers, it's a lot of fun. What's more, since I've been working here, I got to know so many different people, and so many friends,"" Wei said.

Soon, single moms, women with depression or disabilities joined. In fact, the idea of helping these people was already on Song's mind.

She once joined a volunteer program for people with disabilities organized by the government. Their tedious work of twisting screws and the meager wage made her ask: Why not teach them to do something more interesting?

The idea soon materialized after the workshop's founding.

Besides taking tourists on an experience tour, Song started to offer free classes to people in need, especially women and people with disabilities.

""Our first non-profit project is to work with the local women's association and launch Mama Moon Single Mothers' Club,"" a training program for single mothers. ""And in recent years, we have started another program, Happiness on Fingertips, for people with disabilities,"" Song said.

""The mind of people with hearing loss is very peaceful, and in handicrafts, a peaceful mind is a must. I feel they are better at this, because of their quietness,"" Lu said.

One of Song's goals has remained unchanged: She is determined to transform the traditional cloth that is viewed as ""out of fashion"" today into a high-end luxury. That's why she went to Japan to learn new dying techniques, and she has been teaming up with fashion designers to modernize the fabric.

But she is also looking beyond the fabric. She is now working on ceramics to attract male hands. And she is also considering opening a cafe that teaches people with hearing problems how to brew coffee and run a business.

Running the club has enabled the former her, who was very shy, to do something she could never do before: communicate with all kinds of people.

Song sees the cotton-tree flower as a symbol of independence and resilience, a flower she hopes will encourage more women to fight for a better life with their own hands.

""Don't rely on anyone because you are a woman or because you are disadvantaged.""

46,"No game, no life: A young woman's trailblazing entrepreneurship","05:29

""Life is like a game of chess, where every move you make has an impact on the rest of your game,"" Kathy Gong Xiaosi said, looking radiant. Sitting in the open area outside her office in downtown Beijing, Gong, once the youngest national chess champion, recounted how her third startup survived a near collapse. Called Wafa Games, her company uses cutting-edge tech to create fun and dignified gaming experiences. Venturing into the gaming industry requires massive investments and courage to withstand the risk of bankruptcy. But Gong chose to go against the grain. The 35-year-old woman from the southwestern city of Chengdu founded the company in 2017 with a partner she got to know through playing games. ""I'm a gamer, but I found most games boring or even disagreeable since female characters are designed mainly to appeal to male players, with scant clothing and sexualized bodies."" For decades, most video games around the world have portrayed female characters as manifestations of male fantasies with hourglass curves and skinny waists. In hot pants or tiny skirts, they prance around to help, support and take care of their male teammates. Either that or they are framed as ditzy love interests needing to be rescued. Gong developed her deep affection for games during a lonely period while studying in New York, so she decided to fight against this stereotype by creating well-rounded female protagonists, especially for women gamers like her. ""I like hardcore games where you use strategic thinking as you do on the chessboard,"" she said. Female gamers are on the rise, accounting for nearly half of gamers worldwide. In China and the U.S. – the world's two biggest gaming markets – women made up about 48 percent (according to the China Gamers Report) and 41 percent (according to Statista) of gamers respectively in 2020. The female-to-male proportion is even higher when it comes to the mobile gaming market, at 63 percent female and 37 percent male. Women players are fond of a variety of games from adventure to action to strategy, plot-heavy and story-driven, but it can be difficult for them to find elements they relate to.

A gamer, a woman, an entrepreneur The gaming industry is hyper-casual, which makes it difficult to anticipate customer demand and predict what's going to be popular next year. Getting VC funding for a gaming startup is tough. Moreover, a team with well-rounded expertise, cohesion and gender conscience is usually an outlier. For such a startup led by a woman, things get even more complicated. Gong noted that fewer than one in 1,000 female entrepreneurs in the industry have ever gotten early-stage investment. She had to go the extra mile to get things done. Most of the time when she met with investors, they'd ask, ""How do you lead a game company as a woman?"" She was repeatedly told to make people forget as much as possible that she's a woman. Like in most other sectors, women in power are still subordinate to their male counterparts. On the executive board of the top 14 global gaming companies, only 16 percent are women, according to a Forbes study in 2020. The proportion is equally dire out of the C-Suite: Women make up merely 24 percent of employees engaged in game development. In addition, they frequently face discrimination, and receive lower pay than their male counterparts. Most games are created by men, for men. Female representation in both the real world and the make-believe universe is far from fair. ""Gaming needs diversity. I want to make something different,"" Gong said. The way to trailblaze in this boys-only club is rough and checkered. ""Like playing chess, one move is all it takes for your game to fall apart."" In 2019, Wafa Games had a serious problem with cash flow. She sent emails in a frenzy to possible investors, looking for a way out. ""Every day when I walked home, tears just streamed down my face. I ran every day, for 10 kilometers. After that I felt I was reborn. It's just like playing chess: How can you surrender when you are not yet checkmated?""

No checkmate When Gong was little, her father gave up his stable job at an ordnance factory in Huaying Mountains, and her mother, a doctor, quit to help with her father's endeavor. They moved to the nearby city of Chengdu and started a business amidst the tide of reform and opening-up. It was exciting but daunting. The family lived in a rental home, too small to house a wardrobe. And it was hard to find a proper school for Gong since many teachers thought ""a rural kid"" would be a drag on the class. ""I felt inferior in that big city."" One day, she was diagnosed with autism. ""I don't know when it started and don't know whether I've ever recovered."" ""Back then, my mother took me to dancing class, but I wasn't into it,"" Gong recalled. ""One day I saw in an opposite classroom a teacher instructing children how to play chess. That piqued my interest. It was amazing to move the pieces on the glittering chessboard."" Since then, she has been obsessed with chess. ""My father told me every move had a price. At around 9 or 10, I was traveling around the country to participate in chess competitions. He made me do the math by adding up the costs of train tickets, hotels and registration fee, and then calculate how much each move would cost."" Training and practicing day and night paid off. She became the youngest national champion in China's history at the age of 8 and repeated the feat five years later. With such an impressive accomplishment, she was sent to compete in a dozen international tournaments on behalf of China.

A young championship helped Gong deal with her autism, won her a full scholarship to Columbia University, and most importantly, gave her the ability to manage emotions – a crucial element in entrepreneurship. ""Victory is important. Failure is just as important. They both help improve my skills, temper my will, and make me stronger."" Before Wafa Games, Gong founded two startups. The first was called PPoint, an instant messenger for cross-border business negotiation software, which, however, broke by the ninth month before the product came out. She then started a second firm – ai.Law – a robotics company providing affordable legal services in divorce and immigration. For instance, it cost only 1 yuan ($0.15) for one consultation session in a divorce case. To Gong's surprise, 67 percent of the APP's 6 million users were women, many of whom were seeking a divorce from an abusive relationship. During those early years of entrepreneurship, every day was a thrilling yet indulgent excursion. Hardships couldn't derail her. ""You may run out of money, half of your employees quit, and your product even has no potential, but as long as your will does not collapse, there is hope.""

Inspiring through gaming Gong took away important lessons on gender disparities from the user profiles during her experience with ai.Law. She addresses some of them in her latest startup, such as reshaping female characters into warriors. ""In the Middle Ages, there were female generals commanding soldiers on the battlefield. They were brave, resolute, audacious,"" Gong exclaimed. She and her team explored powerful women in history to put in their game. ""We have a female character called Shajar al-Durr, reputed to be the first female Muslim Sultan during the time of the Crusades, which were pretty much a medieval world war. Born a slave, she ascended to the throne, becoming the first woman to rule Egypt since Cleopatra,"" Gong said excitedly when explaining the characters in their game ""Swords of Glory."" In the Middle Ages, a proliferation of women held ruling positions or worked as political elites. Another female protagonist was Eleanor of Aquitaine, one of the most powerful and wealthy women in medieval Europe. She was married to the king of France and then the king of England when divorce was taboo. Historians today are still obsessed with exploring the legend of her life.

While promoting gender diversity through game design, Gong calls for unity among young people from all backgrounds, not just between men and women. Now that 80 percent of millennials and Gen Zers play video games, she thinks it's important to have the younger generations use games for more than play. ""In our game, for example, we have many Muslim players and Christian players. In the real world they might start a fight when they meet, but in the game world they might be brothers."" Now Wafa Games has over 1 million gamers worldwide, 40 percent of whom are women. For her breakthroughs in game AI and related algorithms as well as her effort to promote digital dignity, Gong was named one of the 35 innovators under the age of 35 by MIT Technology Review.

47,Nobel Laureate Mo Yan reveals secret behind his powerful storytelling,"06:35

Nine years after receiving the Nobel Prize in Literature, Mo Yan, 66, shows no sign of letting up in his pursuit of crafting great stories, remaining a passionate storyteller as energetic as he was three decades ago. As one of China's most accomplished contemporary writers, Mo Yan has generated tons of novels that are widely published and have won him multiple honors and awards both at home and abroad. But he achieved celebrity status largely thanks to the stunning success of the eponymous film adaption of his romantic novel Red Sorghum, which was first published in 1986. The acclaimed director Zhang Yimou made a visually striking movie out of the writer's cinematic and suspenseful grand narrative. The film was a huge hit at the box office. It also won the Golden Bear at the 1988 Berlin International Film Festival.

02:07

Since the late 1980s, Mo Yan has deviated from mainstream Chinese literature and created a style to call his own. The Nobel Committee for Literature praised him as the one ""who with hallucinatory realism merges folk tales, history and the contemporary."" Although Mo Yan acknowledges that Garcia Marquez's magic realism style inspired his writing in some way, he insists that he is trudging on a path independent from Marquez. Mo Yan, pseudonym of Guan Moye, was born in 1955 in a small village in east China's Shandong Province. His rural hometown has been the fictionalized setting for most of his stories.

The childhood home of Chinese writer Mo Yan in Gaomi County, east China's Shandong Province, April 2, 2018. /CFP The childhood home of Chinese writer Mo Yan in Gaomi County, east China's Shandong Province, April 2, 2018. /CFP

""I am deeply nourished by folk literature,"" Mo Yan told CGTN, ""I dropped out of school at the fifth grade. After that, I worked with my uncles to do farm work for many years. While my peers were reading with their eyes, I was reading with my ears. I listened to the stories of gods and ghosts, historical legends, and anecdotes told by adults."" And his works have drawn on traditional Chinese folk tales. With a mix of realism and surrealism, Mo Yan's stories are meant to take a harsh look at the dark side of life, with an unflinching dissection of humanity. He told CGTN that he was ""writing as if he himself is the sinner"" when working on his most recent novel Frog, first published in 2009. ""A writer must turn his vision and eyes inward and look at his own heart,"" he said. Apart from his surreal plots, the dimensions Mo Yan gives to his female protagonist are also hard to ignore. The male writer who once admitted he was a feminist during a magazine interview, has created numerous headstrong and rebellious female characters, such as Shangguan Lu in his epic novel Big Breasts & Wide Hips and Dai Fenglian in Red Sorghum Family. Big Breasts & Wide Hips, a story about a mom and her eight daughters, is considered a tribute to the strong females in China.

02:38

Mo Yan laments the miserable destiny of Chinese women in the feudal society, and the female characters in his works stand up against oppression and fight for a way out of despair. ""They rebelled against the feudal system physically. Their body was the only thing they had power over,"" he said. Mo Yan is a keen worshipper of maternal love, so much so that he believes motherhood defines part of a woman's identity. He recounted an encounter with a mother of twins, and the stark contrast between the mom's weary look and her twins' rosy cheeks moved him deeply. ""The sun was setting, and the afterglow beamed down on them. I felt as if I was looking at a sacred picture."" Kjell Espmark, former chairman of the Nobel Committee for Literature, once said that he believed in Mo Yan's capability in continuously writing great stories even after winning the Nobel Prize.

00:54

Mo Yan surely never let people down when it comes to his writing. His latest book A Late Bloomer, a collection of 12 novellas, has won critical acclaim, and people are expecting more from him. During the interview, Mo revealed that his next novel takes on quite a grand theme, and he is still polishing it, without disclosing any further details. Mo Yan said he will keep writing as long as he can. ""Only when I am writing, can I feel the worth and meaning of my life,"" he said."
48,Cinemas facing online challenges during pandemic,"In January 2020, to curb the spread of the coronavirus, cinemas across China were forced to shut down. Production companies that were hoping to make big money during the Chinese New Year holiday were left with no choice but to wait.

But Huanxi Media Group later went another route, it sold the film ""Lost in Russia"" to internet company ByteDance for 630 million yuan ($97.7 million), nearly twice the production cost. Now more and more companies have made similar moves. Although this provides a safety net for some filmmakers, it also means potential revenue loss for cinema chains.

When ""Lost in Russia"" was released online, more than 20 cinema owners across China criticized Huanxi Media in a joint statement, accusing it of breaking industry norms. In North America, when big production companies such as Disney, Sony, Universal Studios, Warner Bros all made similar choices, cinema chains were furious."

52,Gabby Petito coverage stirs racial disparity concerns in U.S. media,"Gabby Petito's disappearance and death has dominated U.S. national headlines but it's also led many to question, why don't missing people of color get the same kind of media attention?

Experts call it ""Missing White Woman Syndrome.""

It describes the disproportionate media coverage of missing white women and girls who are often young, follow a white American beauty standard, and are upper-middle-class, compared to minorities.

While Black people make up 13 percent of the U.S. population, they also make up 35 percent of missing person cases, according to data from the Federal Bureau of Investigation's (FBI) National Crime Information Center's (NCIC) list of active missing persons.

White people make up 76 percent of the population and account for 54 percent of missing person cases.

A 2013 study by Zach Sommers, a sociologist at Northwestern University who studies crime, found that while there are more missing white people, the intensity of that news coverage compared to people of color is different.

In the study, Sommers looked at every missing person case reported on by four media outlets and then cross-referenced that coverage with the FBI's NCIC.

The outlets were a mix of local and national news from different regions of the country.

He found that news outlets were more likely to repeatedly report on missing white women, which increased the total number of articles written about them.

""White women and white girls are dramatically overrepresented. They make up about half of all news stories written about missing persons. It found that African-Americans who go missing receive less coverage or less likely to appear in the news at all,"" Sommers told Tampa's WFLA News Channel 8."

Beijing 2022 presented the key COVID-19 countermeasures for the Olympic Winter Games and Paralympic Winter Games Beijing 2022.

Facing the uncertainty of the global COVID-19 situation, the Beijing 2022 Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games (Beijing 2022), the IOC and the IPC are working closely together to address the situation and to keep the stakeholders informed. To ensure the safety and health of athletes and all stakeholders, Beijing 2022 has always prioritised COVID-19 prevention and control to ensure that the Games are held safely as scheduled.

The principles presented in the IOC Executive Board meeting were as follows:

1.Vaccination policy •All athletes and Games participants who are fully vaccinated will enter the closed-loop management system upon arrival. Games participants who are not fully vaccinated will have to serve a 21-day quarantine upon arrival in Beijing. •Athletes who can provide a justified medical exemption will have their cases considered. •All vaccines recognised by WHO or related international organisations, or approved officially by countries or regions concerned will be accepted.

2.Games-time closed-loop management •From 23 January until the end of the Paralympics, a closed-loop management system will be implemented to ensure the safe delivery of the Games. This closed-loop management system will cover all Games related areas, including arrival and departure, transport, accommodation, catering, competitions, and the Opening and Closing ceremonies. Within the closed-loop, participants will be allowed to move only between Games related venues for training, competitions and work. A dedicated Games transport system will be put in place.

3.Spectators/Ticketing •Given the grave and complicated situation of COVID-19 globally, and to prevent a potential spread of the virus and ensure the safety of all Games participants, no tickets will be sold to spectators from outside China’s mainland. Tickets will be sold exclusively to spectators residing in China’s mainland who meet the requirements of COVID-19 countermeasures. •Specific requirements on COVID-19 countermeasures for spectators from China’s mainland and the details of ticketing arrangements are under discussion and development, and will be released to the public in due course once they are finalised.

4.Accredited guest policy •Beijing 2022 and IOC underlined that all activities are being assessed and optimised to focus on essential aspects of Games delivery. Stakeholders will apply this principle for their plans and delegation composition. •In line with this principle, the IOC EB decided to cancel the accompanying guest category for all stakeholders.

5.Accommodation •Besides athletes and some delegation officials who are accompanying athletes living in the Villages, all participants travelling to Beijing will reside in Beijing 2022-contracted hotels that will be compliant with the COVID-19 countermeasures for the Games.

6.Testing •All domestic and international Games participants and workforce in the closed-loop management system will be subject to daily testing.

In addition, Beijing 2022 will assist those stakeholders that are not in a position to book their pre-Games or Games-time flights independently. Beijing 2022 will release the first version of the Playbooks in late October and the second version in December. The related policies will be detailed in the Playbooks."

61,National Day holiday: Short trips and staycation are new trends,"Short trips are a new trend during this year's National Day holiday due to a rebound in the tourism market and sporadic outbreaks of COVID-19.

Taking annual leave to create a more extended holiday has also become a new choice for many office workers.

The week-long National Day holiday or the ""Golden Week"" boosts tourism much better than the Mid-Autumn Festival holiday, according to the data revealed by TravelGo and Trip.com, China's two major travel platforms.

The number of domestic tourists will reach 650 million during this Golden Week, recovering to more than 80 percent compared with the same period in 2019 before the pandemic, said the TravelGo report.

Though the holiday might be more extended, the fear of the COVID-19 has forced people to choose short-distance trip or even destinations near their homes rather than traveling to distant destinations.

The number of ticket bookings for the National Day holiday through Trip.com has increased by more than 30 percent compared with 2020. Likewise, the proportion of orders from surrounding hotels is much higher than that in the same period in 2020."

A collection of 12 antiques and artworks retrieved from overseas has been allocated to the Tibet Museum in Lhasa, capital of southwest China's Tibet Autonomous Region, said the National Cultural Heritage Administration on Sunday.

The Manhattan District Attorney's Office in the U.S. found a batch of cultural relics in March, which were later confirmed to be illegally smuggled from China. The administration in Beijing requested repatriation of these antiques, and altogether the 12 items were delivered to Beijing in mid-July.

According to experts, these artifacts are believed to be derived from the southwestern part of the country, with the earliest ones dating back to the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644). They have important historical, artistic and scientific values, experts said. Based on preliminary examination, six of them are considered third-class cultural relics according to the country's relic grading system.

Both China and the U.S. are signatories of the UNESCO Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property. Before this, the U.S. had returned multiple batches of cultural relics to China, respectively, in March 2011, December 2015, and February 2019, according to the administration.

The Tibet Museum is the region's largest comprehensive museum. These newly received relics will be displayed in its new exhibition in the future.

Broadway on Sunday finally honored its best and brightest at the Tony Awards, more than a year late due to the coronavirus pandemic, with jukebox musical ""Moulin Rouge!"" sweeping the competition with 10 awards.

The event took on a new look this year: Most of the awards were handed out in a two-hour ceremony livestreamed before the main event – a concert celebrating the return of live theater in New York after an 18-month hiatus.

""Everyone here is vaxxed and tested, and everyone is wearing a mask – every Broadway theater is going to look like this for a while, and that's ok,"" host Leslie Odom Jr said at the start of the concert gala at the Winter Garden Theatre.

""Moulin Rouge! The Musical"" – a stage adaptation of the popular 2001 Baz Luhrmann film of the same name about the famed Paris nightclub – won for best musical, best actor and best actor in a featured role, as well as a host of technical honors.

The cast served up a colorful, sassy medley of hits from the show at their home theater, as did the cast of ""Jagged Little Pill,"" a musical inspired by Alanis Morissette's seminal 1995 album of the same name.

Adrienne Warren, who won the Tony for best actress in a musical for her portrayal of Tina Turner in ""Tina,"" gave a rousing performance with her castmates."
67,Back to prosperity: The revival of rare species in China,"This October, the People's Republic of China (PRC) will celebrate its 72nd founding anniversary. From 1949 to 2021, China has seen rapid development not only in economy and technology but also in ecological restoration. Many rare species were successfully saved from the threat of extinction.

Dubbed ""China's National Treasure,"" the giant panda is one of the most famous species that has been saved from the edge of extinction. The population was once big, but threatened by habitat shrinking and low birth rate due to reasons like food shortage, the giant panda soon became rare in the wild.

To save it, the PRC government decided to set up a national nature reserve in southwest China's Sichuan Province, one of the habitats of the wild pandas. Wolong National Nature Reserve, for example, was established with an initial size of about 20,000 hectares in 1963, and was expanded in 1975 to about 200,000 hectares. China has also cooperated with the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) to provide adequate protection for the species.

In July 2021, thanks to the joint efforts of the government and organizations, China's Ministry of Ecology and Environment announced that giant panda is no longer endangered in the country. According to a report, the giant panda population in the wild increased from 1,114 to 1,864 between the 1980s and 2021.

Other endangered animals, such as the crested ibis, milu deer and Chinese alligator, also saw an increase in their population. By publishing and revising the laws and regulations regarding the country's wildlife conservation status, establishing different levels of nature reserves and raising public awareness of wildlife protection, China has gradually brought back numerous rare species from the brink of extinction. Its goal is to build a society where humans and wildlife can thrive together."

69,Ningxia expo explores global wine culture and tourism,"""Ningxia Wine: A Marvel to the World"" – this is the theme of the first China International Wine Culture and Tourism Expo that kicked off on Sunday in Yinchuan, capital of northwest China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region.

Chinese government officials addressed the opening ceremony. Guests from 16 countries and regions attended the event, mostly through online platforms due to COVID-19.

The expo aims to boost exchanges and cooperation between major wine producers in different countries, with a variety of academic, cultural, and trading activities to be held during the event that runs through September 27.

Ningxia enjoys unique geographical conditions, making it one of the world's ""golden areas"" for growing wine grapes. The region's total grape planting area is 360 square kilometers, taking up one fourth of the country's total.

Thanks to its high quality, Ningxia wine stands out in the global market and has won more than 500 awards both at home and abroad.

""There's excellent planning going into the wine industry from the government side and from the private enterprises. There's a strong commitment and strong drive to expand your wine industry,"" Gert Johannes Grobler, a former senior diplomat of South Africa, told CGTN.

""I have no doubt, just looking at the growth of the last number of years, you (Ningxia's wine industry) will become an important force to be reckoned with in international wine circles,"" Grobler said.

With more than 100 established chateaus, Ningxia now produces 130 million bottles of wine annually, sold to more than 30 countries and regions across the globe.

In May, a national pilot zone for developing the wine industry was set up in Ningxia, the first of its kind in China. The pilot zone aims to turn the region into China's wine capital, just like Bordeaux in France."

Among them, over 200 pieces are replicas of the original relics that are still scattered overseas.

The exhibits are part of among 60,000 cultural relics in total that were discovered in a Sutra cave in 1900. More than 50,000 cultural relics have been lost to dozens of overseas institutions in many countries and regions.

In the past hundred years, with the joint efforts of Dunhuang scholars at home and abroad, the quantity, content and value of the Dunhuang cultural relics from the caves have been identified. However, the items scattered overseas have never returned.

""The UK has the most, France has the best, Russia has the most varieties, while those in Japan are the most secretive, this is how people described about the distribution of the cultural relics from the Sutra Cave,"" said Ji Yanan, exhibition department director of Jiuquan Museum.

To better protect and inherit Dunhuang's artistic treasures, generations of Dunhuang scholars have, over the past hundred years, gone through untold hardships to copy rubbings, sort out and collect the cultural relics scattered abroad, and bring them back in various ways, so that more people can see the excellent traditional culture of Dunhuang and China at large.

The core part of the exhibition is a selection from the British Museum, the British National Library, France's Guimet Museum, the Metropolitan Museum of New York, and other foreign collections of the Dunhuang Caves of cultural relic's replicas, according to Ji.

Through 3D scanning technology, the exhibition presents a high-definition reproduction of the lost historical relics from Dunhuang Cave such as silk paintings, paper paintings, linen paintings, and scrolls of Northern and Southern dynasties (420-589 BC), Sui and Tang dynasties (581-907), five dynasties (907-960), and Northern Song dynasty (960-1127).

It is worth mentioning that the exhibition recreates the scenario in the cave through light and sound, which allows visitors to have a fully immersive experience."

73,French writer exposes U.S. global hegemony,"The number of companies and entrepreneurs that have fallen victim to the U.S. global hegemony is unknown but Marc Lassus, founder of Gemplus, a manufacturer of smart cards (including SIM cards) is one of them.

After witnessing the Frenchman's business making waves with users in the billions, the U.S. took control of the company and drove Lassus away, Chinese newspaper the Global Times has reported. Lassus said that their goal was, through the CIA and NSA, to spy on the whole world.

Lassus has told his story in a recently published book, ""The Chip Trap."" During an interview with the Global Times, he shared his thoughts on Canada's arrest of Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou at the request of the United States.

""Meng Wanzhou's detention in Canada is just a pure scandal, as well as their request for extradition to the U.S,"" he said.

Huawei has a very significant technological advantage in 5G infrastructure and to some extent in fiber optics, their presence in Africa is also very strong and it is too late to beat them, Lassus said. Therefore, the U.S. used brutal and ""cowboy"" approaches to hinder Huawei's business expansion.

He added that Meng's case reminded him of his own experience. He was almost arrested on similar, trumped-up ""charges"" during a private trip to Cuba but he miraculously escaped imprisonment in the U.S.

""The move from the Trump administration to Biden's will not change much the U.S. policies,"" he noted.

He also mentioned that the U.S. claim that it values free markets is ""pure hypocrisy."" They use any possible means to suppress other countries' high-tech companies from being successful in international markets, such as Huawei, ZTE and places pressure on chip manufacturers such as Samsung.

Lassus said he was optimistic about the cooperation between China and Europe, which is entering into a new era with ties becoming more strategic, more complex but more promising.

""It is very clear now China should put more effort and investment than ever to develop key technologies in the semiconductor industry such as key equipment, materials and design tools, and so on. Especially when the U.S. is trying to ban any exchange between world-leading companies and China,"" he said.

The long arm of U.S. jurisdiction dates backs to over a decade ago when the world's biggest power felt threatened by the rapid ascent of other economies. Now the possibility of losing technological advantage haunts Washington, which has resorted to bending the law to gain a competitive edge. Bribery, fraud, and violating sanctions are commonly used pretexts for the U.S. to strike down any individual, entity or country that it feels threatened by.

Frederic Pierucci, an executive of Alstom, a French power and transportation conglomerate, was arrested by the FBI when his plane arrived at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport on April 14, 2013. He was charged with bribing Indonesian officials to win a power plant contract.

Coincidentally or not, the arrest of Pierucci, then president of the French power titan's boiler subsidiary, ran parallel to the largest business acquisition by the American General Electric (GE) of its French rival Alstom's energy business.

Lassus said it was only after January 2019 when Frederic Pierucci published his book ""Le Piege Americain,"" also known as ""The American Trap,"" that he felt free, credible, and publicly protected to come out with his story.

""Pierucci's book relates the U.S. aggression, through General Electric, to take control of ALSTOM, a French company. Pierucci has been put for two years in jail in the US! A real scandal,"" Lassus said.

Chinese Farmers' Harvest Festival falls on Autumn Equinox, which is September 23 this year. The festival was approved by China's State Council in 2018, not only to honor Chinese farmers' work, but also to showcase the country's agriculture-oriented tradition. China's grain production has remained consistent with over 650 billion kilograms for the past five years, and the summer grain harvest in 2020 set a new high, with a 0.9 percent increase from the previous year, according to National Bureau of Statistics of China in 2020. With a population of 1.4 billion, nearly one fifth of the world's population, how China feeds its people has been a global concern.

Viewers wait for the first screening of Somali films at The National Theater of Somalia in Mogadishu, September 22, 2021. /CFP

Somalis got to experience the magic of cinema once again, as the conflict-ravaged country hosted its first public screening in 30 years on Wednesday, even amid heavy security.

""This is going to be a historic night for the Somali people, it shows how hopes have been revived... after so many years of challenges,"" theater director Abdikadir Abdi Yusuf said before the screening.

Mogadishu was home to many cinema halls during its cultural heyday but the seaside capital fell silent after civil war erupted in 1991.

The National Theater of Somalia, which was built by Chinese engineers as a gift from Mao Zedong in 1967, used to host live concerts and plays, but in recent decades, it was targeted by suicide bombers and used as a base by warlords.

After a painstaking restoration, the authorities announced plans to hold the theater's first screening this week.

And for the first time, it screened Somali films.

The evening's program was two short features by Somali director IBrahim CM: ""Hoos"" and ""Date from Hell.""

The tickets sold for $10 each, which was expensive for many. But for many Somalis, the evening was a trip down memory lane and a reminder of happier times.

""I used to watch concerts, dramas, pop shows, folk dances and movies in the national theater during the good old days,"" said Osman Yusuf Osman, a self-confessed film buff.

""It makes me feel bad when I see Mogadishu lacking the nightlife it once had. But this is a good start,"" he told AFP.

A mother-of-six, Hakimo Mohamed, also recalled watching live concerts and dramas at the national theater as a schoolgirl, but said she now worried about safety.

""People used to go out during the night and stay back late if they wished – but now, I don't think it is so safe,"" she said.

Attendees had to pass through several security checkpoints before arriving at the theater, inside a heavily guarded complex that includes the presidential palace and the parliament.

But for some, the inconvenience and the risks paled in comparison to the anticipation of seeing a film in a cinema after such a long wait.

""I was not lucky to watch live concerts and or movies in the theater (earlier)... because I was still a child, but I can imagine how beautiful it was,"" NGO employee Abdullahi Adan said.

""I want to experience this for the first time and see what it's like to watch a movie with hundreds of people in a theater.""

89,Napoleon's bicorne fetches $1.43 million at auction,"One of Napoleon Bonaparte's bicorne hats with great historical value was successfully auctioned at Sotheby's Paris for 1.22 million euros ($1.43 million) on Wednesday.

The bicorne, once belonging to the legendary European statesman and general, is one of only 19 hats that historians confirmed to have been worn by Napoleon, according to Sotheby's.

The length of the bicorne is 49 centimeters, the front wing size is 15 centimeters and the tail wing size is 20.5 centimeters. The inside of the hat was lined with silk instead of leather materials, because Napoleon was said to be allergic to leather.

What's more rare is that Napoleon wore this bicorne hat when he signed the ""Treaty of Tilsit"" with Russia and Prussia in June 1807, which makes it historically significant.

Napoleon signed the treaty after leading the French army to defeat the Russian and Prussian coalition forces. The treaty affected the future division of the European continent and at the same time affected the direction of French-Russian relations.

In 1814, Sir Stewart from Scotland bought this bicorne in Germany, and recorded the process in his diary. Sotheby's Paris initially estimated the bicorne at 400,000 to 600,000 euros, before raising the estimate by 100,000 euros. The auction price was 1,222,500 euros, nearly double the estimated price."

92,Guochao: homegrown designs making a splash among young consumers,"03:21

A special fashion trend called Guochao, which means national wave, is taking Beijing Design Week by storm. The trend is about wearing homegrown brands. For Generation Z Chinese, getting in touch with their roots in a world influenced by Western aesthetics is a natural choice. At a special section dedicated to Guochao, old heritage brands are gathering interest apart from the newly established ones, which usually demonstrate the rising trend. A giant installation shows different garments intertwined with each other is making heads turn at the ChaoYoung section at Beijing Design Week. It's a part of the showcase of Less is More, a branch brand of Lilanz, one of the country's leading menswear brands with over 30 years of history.

Less is More targets young consumers with their lineup of business and casual wear and conveys the message of embracing all the possibilities. Man Yang, an artist who created this installation, told CGTN that he had de-constructed the garments. He said: ""The trousers and the jackets are not worn the usual way, because I want to invite people to think outside the box and reflect on the clothing's function in our daily life, to unveil the many other possibilities of clothing."" Bai Zhe, who helped curate the Less is More exhibition area, the installation ""Embrace"" also hints at old heritage brands like Lilanz embracing new designs and new customers. He said: ""I used to see my father wearing garments from the brand, and now I also wear the brand because it's been absorbing new energy and keeping up with the aesthetics of the youth today. They see that time-honored brand can be full of surprises.""

In recent years, young Chinese consumers have been increasingly interested in integrating traditional Chinese culture and style with domestic brands and products. And for up-and-coming fashion designer William Shen, the cultural legacy has been his biggest inspiration. He's been incorporating auspicious signs of dragons and phoenixes into down jacket designs. He calls it a 5-D down jacket as it encapsulates both time-honored cultural traditions and history. Shen said that they'd decorated the area like the Great Wall with a down jacket imitating the bricks of the wall and relief of dragons and Pheonix decorated on the wall.

Non-Hong Kong residents, traveling from Guangdong Province and Macao to Hong Kong, can now enjoy quarantine exemptions. All they will need is valid proof of a negative nucleic acid test, obtained within three days before arrival or on the day itself. This is thanks to a new travel scheme called, ""Come2hk,"" that's being implemented in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR). To qualify, would-be visitors must have stayed in Guangdong Province, Macao or Hong Kong for at least two weeks before seeking entry into the city. The scheme is expected to boost visitor inflows into the SAR while keeping the local population safe. Those who enter Hong Kong under this scheme must keep up regular testing after gaining entry.

The scheme also has exemptions. Places deemed high-risk for the virus, for example, the Yuexiu and Haizhu districts in Guangzhou, will be excluded. For now, the only way to enter the city is by road, through the Shenzhen Bay Port or the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge Hong Kong Port. These ports each have a daily quota of 1,000 visitors, and to secure a spot, people must apply through an online booking system. Over the first five days, since the scheme's September 15 launch, 1,932 people have entered the city; of that figure, 1,722 arrived via the Shenzhen Bay Port, while the remaining 210 used the other port. While Hong Kong recorded 19 imported cases since the launch, none were from the Chinese mainland or Macao.

""I came to visit my family. I haven't seen my wife and children for a whole year. I was so nervous and excited. I didn't really sleep at all last night because I only managed to get a quota confirmation at 1 a.m.,"" said a man who arrived from Foshan City, in south China's Guangdong Province. Another woman, whose son hadn't been able to attend school in Hong Kong for about two years because of the pandemic, said that once ""Come2hk"" was announced, and they realized quarantine could be avoided, they immediately applied for it. She added that she had received a lot of assistance from staff throughout the process, and that it was very reassuring. ""Come2hk"" was meant to roll out in May but was suspended until now because of virus outbreaks across the border. Its launch comes a week after the resumption of another cross-border scheme called ""Return2hk,"" which allows Hong Kong residents to return from the Chinese mainland and Macao without quarantine. The government said ""Return2hk"" resumed because the pandemic situation had stabilized in Hong Kong, Macao and the Chinese mainland. Since ""Return2hk"" began last November, 299,240 Hong Kong residents have returned to the city under the scheme, according to the latest figures.

The National Museum of China has launched a special mooncake gift box, which can become a paper lantern, creating the perfect atmosphere while moon gazing. It's one of the museum's items created especially for the Mid-Autumn Festival this year, aiming to encourage people to come to the museum and learn more about Chinese culture.

Liao Fei, general manager of the National Museum of China Culinary Culture Ltd., which produced the gift box, told CGTN that the box's design was inspired by a lacquer plate from the Song Dynasty in the museum's collection, and this was then transformed into a six-layered paper lantern. ""Instead of a paper bag, the box was wrapped by a handkerchief on the outside, presented as a lunch box in ancient China style. Each box includes eight classic mooncakes in flavors including lotus and red bean paste. There are mooncakes shaped like a rabbit and persimmon, all with their own auspicious sign,"" he explained. In recent years, museums in China have engaged in market competition with mooncakes carrying unique cultural symbols. It's part of their strategy to revitalize their collection and reach out to younger audiences.

Statistics from Tmall.com, China's largest B2C shopping website, show that purchases by young consumers doubled this year compared to the same period last year, with culturally-inspired products in the lead. The platform said that mooncakes that feature cultural characteristics meet young customers' demand for self-expression. Qi Junsheng, general manager of Tmall Food & Fresh Division told CGTN: ""We see a lot of creativity going into the wrappings and gift boxes of the mooncakes. There's a gramophone where you can record greetings for your friends and family on this special occasion."" Museums overseas have also joined the race. This year, the Louvre Museum in Paris teamed up with Häagen-Dazs China to roll out ice-cream mooncakes themed after masterpieces from the museum's collection, including the Mona Lisa and Venus de Milo.

The main stage was inspired by the Big Dipper, a constellation of the seven brightest stars of the larger constellation Ursa Major, and China's own global navigation satellite system, BeiDou, named after the Big Dipper asterism, symbolizing best wishes for happiness, reunion, companionship and coexistence. Featuring space elements, it will spotlight people who have devoted themselves to the development of China's aerospace industry. Singer Zhou Shen will perform a song about stars to pay tribute to industry heroes.

101,Mastering Chinese Poetry: Get into the autumn evening with Wang Wei,"04:56

In Chinese beliefs, the full moon is a symbol of peace, harmony, luck and family reunion, that's one of the reasons why appreciating the full moon has become the highlight of the Mid-Autumn Festival, a well-known traditional Chinese festival that can be traced back to Tang Dynasty (618–907). People usually gather with their loved ones and share tasty meals and moon cakes for celebration. For Chinese writers and poets, the moon is not just about the festival, but also brings endless inspiration to them. In this episode of Mastering Chinese Poetry let's take the time machine and back into that peaceful autumn night in mountains with Chinese poet Wang Wei.

Autumn Evening in the Mountains After fresh rain in mountains bare; Autumn permeates evening air. Among pine-trees bright moonbeams peer; Over crystal stones flows water clear. Bamboos whisper of washer-maids; Lotus stirs when fishing boat wades. Though fragrant spring may pass away， Still here's the place for you to stay. （Translated by Xu Yuanchong）

Wang Wei is a renowned landscape poet and a talented landscape painter of Tang Dynasty. One of China's greatest poets Su Shi once commented on his work: ""Pictures in poems, poems in pictures."" I personally can't agree more, as Wang's poems always present a portray of imagery, like the poem above. kōng shān xīn yǔ hòu， 空山新雨后， tiān qì wǎn lái qiū。 天气晚来秋。 ""After fresh rain in mountains bare; Autumn permeates evening air."" The first line draws such a calming picture: It has just rained in the mountains without crowds around, the fresh and cool autumn vibe comes stronger as the night falls. If you read the line one more time, you may even smell the moist air with the fragrance of wet grass and earth of autumntime. míng yuè sōng jiān zhào， 明月松间照， qīng quán shí shàng liú。 清泉石上流。 This line is considered one of the most classic descriptions of the moon：the magnificent moonlight surrounding the wet mountain, first it gently through the pine trees and then reflect to the clear forest spring which gurgled on the rocks. At this moment, you may hear the breeze from forests, the sound of water running… or you may hear nothing but your breath. The magic here is that there was no 3D or VR tech back then, but the poet Wang Wei can always take the readers into his scenery with a few simple words.

zhú xuān guī huàn nǚ， 竹喧归浣女， lián dòng xià yú zhōu。 莲动下渔舟。 There is a slight laugh from the bamboo forest. It's the laundry girl coming back from the waterside underneath the moonlight; the lotus leaves are wandering, that must be the fisher is working on his canoe. What an ingenious description! As if someone is not far away but could not be directly seen and only heard the sound of people laughing and talking, which highlights the quiet atmosphere and natural surroundings again. This poem is written during Wang Wei's seclusion in Zhongnan Mountains, Northwest China. It expresses his pursuit of the simple and quiet mountain life. The poet's natural and fresh brushwork vividly depicts the natural beauty of the mountain and the harmonious beauty of villagers' life, which arouse readers' yearning for a simple and peaceful life. suí yì chūn fāng xiē， 随意春芳歇， wáng sūn zì kě liú。 王孙自可留。 ""Though fragrant spring may pass away, Still here's the place for you to stay."" At the end of the poem, Wang shared his open-minded philosophy of life. Although the spring is gone, autumn is equally beautiful, why not stay away from the chaos of the world and stay in the mountains to feel the true meaning of life？"

A stage actress' Mid-Autumn Festival,"""We have more shows to be staged during the festival,"" the actress explained, adding that the theater where she works is expecting the biggest number of visitors yet after being closed for over 40 days due to the heavy rain and the virus outbreak.

After the deadly floods which struck central China's Zhengzhou in July, followed by a COVID-19 flare-up that shut down parts of this city of 10 million in August, autumn heralds a new beginning for Chen.

""How I'd like to spend this festival? I want to go home, but I can't make it this year,"" Chen told CGTN during an exclusive interview before the festival began.

It's the third Mid-Autumn Festival Chen won't spend with her family, but she's committed to her craft.

Since 2020, Brunei and China have extended mutual assistance in addressing the COVID-19. Brunei provided financial assistance to help China manage the impact of the coronavirus in March 2020. ""A lot of my friends asked me how I felt about getting a Chinese-made vaccine. And I will tell you that earlier this year, because the first batch of Chinese-made vaccine was used up here in Brunei, there is a video showing an old lady who was upset that she couldn't get it. She said in the video 'I don't want to use other kinds of vaccines'. That video soon became quite popular here, so you can see there are a lot of people in Brunei who trust Chinese vaccines,"" Wu added.

111,China's tax authority warns celebrities to pay taxes by year end,"As China's Ministry of Culture pushes for stricter regulation of the entertainment industry, the taxation authorities are also cracking down on celebrities, including actors and social media influencers, found to be evading taxes.

A nationwide campaign was launched shortly after a famous actress made the headlines with a fine of $46 million for evading taxes. Zheng Shuang failed to declare 191-million-yuan worth of personal income earned over the past two years and had evaded taxes worth 45.27 million yuan. She was also found to have underpaid her taxes by 26.52 million yuan.

The State Taxation Administration issued a notice and required celebrities to pay up taxes by self-declaration before the end of 2021. Reminding the celebrities of regularly examining their tax records, the notice said one-to-one risk reminders will be issued for those with tax-related risks based on the situation of individual income tax settlement and the payment made in 2020.

Those who voluntarily report and promptly rectify tax-related problems before the end of 2021 may be exempted or given lighter or mitigated punishment.

Anyone who refuses to cooperate with the tax authorities' investigation and verification and supervision of rectification shall be ordered to rectify their behaviors in accordance with the law, and the competent authorities and associations in the industry shall be asked to assist in the supervision and correction; if the circumstances are serious, they shall be investigated and dealt with strictly in accordance with the law.

In the past, in order to attract investment and play a star effect, some places have loosely regulated the enjoyment of preferential tax policies in the entertainment industry, and even introduced some illegal ""local policies"" such as tax refunds.

Many celebrities set up shell companies in tax havens such as Khorgos in northwest China's Xinjiang thus enjoying tax incentives and financial rebates in disguise. In the future, supervision in this area will continue to be strengthened, as will compliance with the principle of substantive operation, and the review process will be more stringent, so as to prevent the shell companies established by celebrities from enjoying preferential policies that should not be obtained."

113,Xinjiang residents refute 'cultural genocide' claims,"""Heroes on horses, birds on wings,"" that's a proverb of the Kazakh ethnic minority group. Kazakh horseback riding is listed as one of China's intangible cultural heritages and is very popular among the Kazakh people in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.

Alibetti Haliyora is a horseback riding enthusiast from the city of Karamay in Xinjiang. He shared how villagers from his hometown enjoy and benefit from an annual racing event, their experiences practicing Xinjiang's traditional sports and how it helps spread the Kazakh culture at a press conference on Friday.

Alibetti said he read on the internet that some people with ill intentions say Xinjiang is engaged in ""cultural genocide.""

""This is nonsense!""said Alibetti.

He said the racing event has attracted many tourists and brought more money to their pockets, which made the villagers very happy and more eager to raise horses and do horse racing.

Other Xinjiang residents have also refuted Western allegations of ""cultural genocide"" and ""human rights violations"" in the region.

Tennur Ayidahan from Tacheng City proudly showed her son's certificate of merit and medal for playing local sport Daur Bako, or field hockey, with his school team.

Competitive sports have become popular in Xinjiang. Parhatti, a wrestling coach from the Karamay Amateur Sports School, introduced his career in competitive wrestling training. His student Walihan Sailike was the winner of the bronze medal in the 60-kilogram wrestling event at the Tokyo Olympics this year.

Parhatti said a traditional minority sports meeting is held every four years to promote and develop the sports culture of ethnic minorities. Sports talents from ethnic minority groups have always been selected and trained. Parhatti said they have sent many athletes to the national team and there are now eight athletes from Xinjiang on the Chinese national wrestling team.

Acrobatic sports including wheel trapeze and Darwaz – or aerial tightrope walking – were also introduced at the press conference.

Guhel Zeyiting of the Uygur ethnic minority group is a member of the Awat County Art Troupe. She introduced at the conference her exciting wheel trapeze competition experience. She and her teammates went to Guangzhou to participate in the 8th National Traditional Games of Ethnic Minorities in 2007. During the match, they pulled together and performed many skilled moves on fast spinning wheels in the air.

Sportsmanship has taken root in people's hearts and is showing strong vitality in Xinjiang with the support from both local and central governments.

According to the deputy director of Xinjiang's sports bureau, the General Administration of Sport of China has invested more than 1 billion yuan (some $150 million) to support sports development in the region over the past 10 years. The region now has 67,700 sports venues, with its per capita sports area of 2.03 square meters.

Residents in Xinjiang always welcome tourists to appreciate and learn more about their traditional sports culture."
114,"Desert camel carvings dated to around 7,000 years ago","Life-sized carvings of camels and horses hewn into rock faces in Saudi Arabia could be around 7,000 years old, according to new research that suggests they are significantly older than previously thought.



The 21 reliefs, which were only recently discovered, are heavily eroded and were initially estimated in 2018 to be some 2,000 years old based on similarities with artworks found in Petra in Jordan.



But the new research by Saudi and European institutions used a variety of different methods, including analyzing tool marks and erosion patterns as well as x-ray technology, and suggests the reliefs are around 7,000 to 8,000 years old.



This would mean that the area of carvings, known as the Camel Site, ""is likely home to the oldest surviving large-scale (naturalistic) animal reliefs in the world,"" the study said.



In the era that it was created, the region would have looked very different from the arid landscape of today, with a savannah-like grassland dotted with lakes and trees, where wild camels roamed and were hunted.



""We can now link the Camel Site to a period in prehistory when the pastoral populations of northern Arabia created rock art and built large stone structures called mustatil,"" the authors said in a press release issued by the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History.



""The Camel Site is, therefore, part of a wider pattern of activity where groups frequently came together to establish and mark symbolic places."""

121,UK eases international travel rules,"The UK government has announced major changes to its rules for international travel from October 4, opening up more destinations and relaxing testing requirements.

The traffic light system for travel has been simplified, with countries either on a red list, or free of restrictions. The amber list grouping has been scrapped.

Unvaccinated people arriving from amber destinations previously needed to quarantine at home for up to 10 days.

Marzipan tribute to Angela Merkel

Another key change is that PCR tests will no longer be required for those entering the UK from non-red list countries who have been double-jabbed.

The PCR tests cost around $100 on average and were required on day two after arriving in the country. From October 4 they will be replaced with a simpler and cheaper lateral flow test, which many experts say are less accurate.

The changes will apply to England initially, with Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland setting their own rules on travel and tackling COVID-19.

Red list cut

Before the announcement, there were 62 countries on the red list, which represents the highest level of restrictions. But eight countries have now been moved off it – Turkey, Pakistan, the Maldives, Egypt, Sri Lanka, Oman, Bangladesh and Kenya.

Those coming from countries still on the UK's red list have to go into a government-approved hotel quarantine for up to 11 nights, at a personal cost of $3,150.

Countries classified as red still include popular holiday destinations such as Brazil, South Africa and Thailand.

Friday's changes mean many locations now moving to the green list, where trips are permitted.

Business impact

Businesses in the travel and tourism sector have breathed a sigh of relief at the latest news, but say much more help is needed.

The industry has been battered by the pandemic. In July, the World Travel and Tourism Council told CGTN Europe that 62 million jobs were lost in the sector last year, with more still at risk.

In a further blow to the UK, London's Heathrow Airport has fallen from Europe's busiest before the pandemic to 10th place, as passenger numbers remain subdued.

August was the busiest month for Heathrow since the COVID-19 pandemic swept across the world last year, with 2.2 million travelers passing through it. But those numbers are still down around 70 percent on 2019 levels.

Heathrow CEO John Holland-Kaye said that without bolder action from the government, the country ""will fall further behind [European rivals] as trade and tourists will increasingly bypass the UK.""

Amsterdam's Schiphol was the busiest airport on the continent last month, with 33,590 flights handled there, according to data on its website.

A spokesperson for the UK Department for Transport previously said the UK's policies are ""guided by one overwhelming priority – public health."""

The final 24 candidates in ""The Media Challengers"" campaign – a global host-reporter recruitment event organized by CGTN – were officially announced on Friday.

The final 24 candidates assembled in Beijing's Shougang Park and the National Winter Training Center Ice Hockey Hall on Friday to prepare to set off for the cities of Xi'an, Wuhan, Shanghai or Yunnan, continuing to the final stage of the competition by participating in a reality TV show. ""The Media Challengers"" recruitment process began on April 8, 2021, with the goal of recruiting talented new media professionals worldwide and introduce new ideas into international communication in the context of media convergence. It was a rigorous process that set a high standard for entrants to prove qualified to be a CGTN global host, reporter or internet celebrity. Thirty professional reviewers, including experts and scholars in the media field, well-known media agency executives, well-loved opinion leaders and industry leaders, provided authoritative and professional coverage for this recruitment campaign.

The online ""Like"" vote-gathering activities also fully demonstrated the participants' appeal to fans in the new media era. The 24 finalists were all chosen based on scores counted from a combination of professional selection and online likes. To advance to the next stage, the shortlisted contestants will now be challenged through a ""reality show"" where they will be required to complete a live ""discovery broadcast"" during which the candidates must complete missions, ""remote guest connection"" that one guest for each team to connect and represent overseas challengers within the missions in China, and a ""snap stream,"" among other challenges. CGTN will air the selection process on film. From the very beginning, ""The Media Challengers"" campaign attracted social media influencers, internet celebrities and opinion leaders from all over the world. It has also aroused widespread international media coverage and attention. The candidates are young, energetic, confident and optimistic, and have a unique understanding of the world. Domestically, the final 24 candidates are about to travel to Xi'an, Wuhan, Shanghai or Yunnan to see the beauty of China through their own eyes and document the new developments that are taking place.

In Xi'an, it is hoped that the ancient cultural heritage will inspire the young journalists and allow them to record the ""cultural resonance"" of the city; in Shanghai, the Mid-Autumn Festival special report team will interact with traditional Han cultural activities while presenting their thoughts and those of younger generations; in Wuhan, they will visit the land of Jingchu where ancient and modern meet, while experiencing the charm of the city's heroic past and the market culture that has rapidly recovered from the epidemic; in Yunnan, the contestants will try the latest travel check-in methods, immerse themselves in the fun of operating a homestay, and experience the unique landscape of Chinese mountains and rivers together with young entrepreneurs.

The event provides a platform for aspiring young journalists to display their talents and pursue their dreams while also allowing them to represent their generation's voice in the world. It is also an opportunity for young media professionals to tell Chinese stories. The global epidemic has not yet completely subsided. Considering the actual needs of epidemic prevention and control, overseas Media Challengers cannot come to China. However, this presents a fresh challenge as the new generation of journalists can fully demonstrate the power of technology. In the era of integrated media, multi-screen linkage, the pace of globalization will not stagnate due to time and space constraints.

124,Is there a future for plant-based seafood?,"A Hope Tree restaurant offers plant-based meatballs produced by Zhenmeat, in Beijing, China, September 4, 2020. /Reuters A Hope Tree restaurant offers plant-based meatballs produced by Zhenmeat, in Beijing, China, September 4, 2020. /Reuters

Plant-based meat alternatives, pegged by creators as a more sustainable food source, have exploded on the Chinese market over the last two years. These vegan options are now available everywhere, from high-end restaurants to fast-food chains like McDonald's. This begs the question: could plant-based seafood be the next big thing?

At the Beijing preview of OmniFoods' new seafood menu on August 29, Arrow Factory Brewing served ""fish"" and chips alongside ""tuna"" fishcakes. Even the omnivores in the room had difficulty believing the flakey double fish burger, laden with cheese and tartare sauce, was entirely vegan. This has been the motivation for the founder of Green Monday & OmniFoods, David Yeung, since his first products went live in 2018 – to create something satisfying for vegans and meat-eaters alike. ""Plant-based meat is an emerging new category which does not need consumers to sacrifice their love for good food,"" Yeung said after the recent launch. ""Over the last few years, we have had successful launches, and we received great reviews, even from meat-eaters who have no intention of becoming vegan.""

It's no surprise that plant-based entrepreneurs like Yeung have been focusing on the Chinese market in recent years, given the steady growth in demand for meat alternatives – a trend that is expected to continue. Consultancy firm Euromonitor has estimated the country's plant-based meat market will grow from around $10 billion in 2018 to nearly $12 billion by 2023. However, plant-based seafood takes up less than one percent of the meat alternative sector. Yeung thinks it's an overlooked area, especially when considering the potential Asian market. ""Asia's seafood intake makes up 73 percent of the global total, compared to 12 percent in Europe and 5.3 percent in the U.S. Seafood is consumed five times more than beef in Asia,"" he said. In Yeung's opinion, plant-based fish could provide a solution to some of the problems currently facing the fishing industry. ""From an impact standpoint, it is of utmost urgency that we protect the marine ecosystem and stop climate change,"" he said. ""The ocean is the lung of the earth, and fishing is causing insurmountable harm to the ocean. Thus, there is an urgency to preserve it in whatever way we can."" However, the vast majority of people are unaware of the environmental challenges facing the oceans. A representative at Green Monday pointed out that although switching to plant-based seafood would be good for the ocean, this reasoning is not yet widely accepted in China. ""Although some know that fish from the ocean or river are very likely to be contaminated and may contain serious toxins like mercury,"" he said, ""That natural resources are quickly depleting, the majority of people remain unaware.""

Located in the Chinese capital's historic commercial area of Qianmen, Page One is one of the most popular bookstores in Beijing. This massive bookstore stocks hundreds of English-language and art and design books and it's recently expanded to include more categories.

Mr Li, a customer, said of the bookstore: ""Sometimes when you sit here and read books or you look up and see the view of Qianmen, it feels like you are traveling through time. I feel serenity here and it's better to read at a bookstore instead of a coffee house.""

Just a block away at Nanxiaoshun Hutong is Hua Diehui, a bookstore tailored for women that offers weekly seminars and lectures. Xiao Shuying is a clothing bookstore where people can pick up a story about Chinese fashion. Another attraction is a teahouse-themed bookstore called Kungfu Pu'er Tea, where people can have a cup of tea while enjoying a good read.

Integrating bookstores with social life, clothing and tea culture, the ""book"" street is on the trial phase of operation, and the next phase is already under construction, aiming to create a living room full of books and vitality.

For privately operated bookstores, it's still challenging to make a living. Wu Yanping, the managing partner of the bookstore One Way Space, said the bookstore has struggled to stay afloat in a challenging economy and he decided to diversify to attract people.

From chain bookstores to creative 'book' street to traditional private bookstore, bookstore owners in Beijing are racking their brains to win back customers to the printed word."

""In Paris, Christo and Jeanne-Claude dreamed of packing the Arc de Triomphe. Today, this project is coming to life,"" said Hidalgo on Twitter.

Imagined in 1961 by the late Bulgarian-born artist Christo, ""L'Arc de Triomphe, Wrapped"" was finally brought to life by Christo's nephew, Vladimir Yavatchev, at a cost of about 14 million euros ($16.54 million).

Christo, whose full name was Christo Vladimirov Javacheff, was known for his larger-than-life installations. The renowned artist died of natural causes at his home in New York City in late May last year.

A memorial ceremony was held in northeastern China's Liaoning Province on Thursday to commemorate the victims of the massacre carried out by Japanese invaders in 1932. Representatives from different walks of life participated in the ceremony, observing a moment of silence and laying flowers before a monument specially built in the memory of those killed in the massacre. ""We want to express our deep condolences to the innocent compatriots through the event, which is expected to remind people of the grave sufferings brought by the Japanese invaders and extend Chinese people's determination and willingness to maintain peace,"" said Gai Lanlan, deputy curator of the Pingdingshan Massacre Memorial Hall in the city of Fushun that hosted the event.

On September 15, 1932, more than 1,000 guerrillas from Liaoning attacked some of the Japanese invaders' warehouses and factories in Pingdingshan Village while killing several Japanese soldiers. The next day, in the act of revenge, the Japanese troops rounded up some 3,000 civilians from the village, including many elderly people, women and children. They slaughtered them using cruel ways on the pretext that the villagers had conspired with the guerrillas. The murderers buried the victims on the spot by blowing up a hill in the village. The massacre, the first one during the 14-year Japanese invasion of China, started with an attack on September 18, 1931, in Shenyang, the capital city of Liaoning Province.

The Pingdingshan Massacre Memorial Hall was first built in 1972 after the remains of some 800 victims were unearthed. Over the past decades, memorial activities have been held annually. Representatives from Japanese civil society have also attended some of the events.



""I've visited the memorial hall for several times. I feel so sorry for the victims every time I see the remains. I think every one of us should work hard to make our country stronger to win respect from other countries,"" said Cui Lina, a resident of Fushun.

""Broadway is back and it's a fun thing for everybody,"" said Jenni Milanoski, who traveled with her daughter from Boston, hoping to see ""Hamilton.""

Broadway theaters have been gradually reopening throughout September but Tuesday heralds the collective return of some of its most popular shows. September 14 was the date former Governor Andrew Cuomo said Broadway would reopen back in May.

All audiences are required to be vaccinated, as are performers, backstage crew and theater staff, while spectators must also wear masks throughout the show. Theater fans said they felt safe returning to indoor performances knowing that everybody was vaccinated despite concerns about the highly infectious Delta variant.

Broadway generated around $33 million in sales per week across 31 shows before COVID-19 swept the Big Apple in March 2020, forcing the abrupt shutdown that left thousands in the industry suddenly without work. The pandemic has killed 34,000 people in New York City. The resumption of shows comes with the city still suffering a huge shortfall in tourists, which typically make up two-thirds of audiences. But officials and theaters are confident that New Yorkers, and those who can visit, are desperate to watch live theater again.

China's lucrative National Day holiday box office is set to see a star-studded four-part anthology film roughly translated as ""Me and My Father's Generation"" lock horns with the highly-anticipated war film ""The Battle at Lake Changjin.""

The release date of ""Me and My Father's Generation"" has been brought forward by one day to September 30, the last business day before the National Day holiday begins on October 1. The holiday is known as a golden week for major cultural and tourism consumption.

The announcement, made via the official Weibo account of the film on Tuesday, meant ""Me and My Father's Generation"" will have the same release day with ""The Battle at Lake Changjin.""

""Me and My Father's Generation"" is jointly directed by Wu Jing, Zhang Ziyi, Xu Zheng and Shen Teng, all of whom also play the leading roles.

It adopts the storytelling technique of collective creation – one film containing multiple stories by different directors – similar to anthology movies ""My People, My Country"" and ""My People, My Homeland."" The latter two hit theaters around the National Day of 2019 and 2020, respectively, and achieved huge market success.

""The Battle at Lake Changjin"" is jointly helmed by Chen Kaige, Hark Tsui and Dante Lam, all big names in the Chinese film industry. It follows the Chinese People's Volunteers (CPV) in a courageous battle during the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea (1950-1953).

141,MOFA backs Stanford professors' call to end 'China Initiative',"The ""China Initiative"" is a tool for anti-China forces in the U.S. to abuse the concept of national security to contain and suppress China, Zhao Lijian, a spokesperson for China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA), told a regular press conference on Tuesday.

A group of 177 Stanford faculty members on Monday sent an open letter to the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), criticizing the ""China Initiative"" launched by the administration of former U.S. President Donald Trump in 2018.

""The China Initiative has deviated significantly from its aimed mission; it is harming the United States' research and technology competitiveness, and it is fueling biases that, in turn, raise concerns about racial profiling,"" they said.

According to Zhao, the media have exposed that the ""China Initiative"" sets targets before investigating cases, and such disregard of judicial justice will only lead to cases involving unjust, false or wrong charges. As of the end of March, none of the so-called China-Related Cases Examples posted on the DOJ website involved intellectual property or commercial theft, with charges ranging from fraud to misrepresentation and tax evasion.

The joint letter signed by the faculty members once again proves that more and more people in the U.S. have realized that the ""China Initiative"" is essentially a tool for anti-China forces in the U.S. to abuse the concept of national security to contain and suppress China, he added. The initiative has not only seriously impacted China-U.S. relations, but also aggravated racial discrimination in the U.S. and caused grave damage to the Asian American community.

""We urge the U.S. side to heed the just call from all walks of life in the U.S., earnestly correct its mistakes and stop interfering with normal exchanges and cooperation between China and the U.S. in science, technology, culture and other fields,"" said Zhao."

The opening ceremony showcased the works of eight award-winning designers from the host city. Among them were talented female designers Wang Peina and Zhou Hong. Together, they put on a fashion show which thrilled the audience.

It's the biggest edition of the fair, thus far. The fair adopted both online and offline marketing strategies and livestream channels to fuel the business of the participating enterprises.

Domestic designs were definitely in the spotlight. More than 450 domestic brands participated, accounting for 75 percent of the total. In the exhibition area of the brand ""TRANDS,"" the focus was on the ""Guochao"" series of Chinoiserie couture suits. Dayang Group, its owner, is a leader in China's textile and garment industry, which is renowned for its suit-making expertise.

Hu Dongmei, general manager of Dayang Group, said they launched their innovative products involving intangible cultural heritage in their ""Guochao"" series. They added Chinese elements such as Suzhou embroidery into their suits. The combination of Chinese and Western, classical and innovative, resonated with the aesthetics of the young generation.

There was plenty of focus too on various independent fashion designers' works and a wedding dress exhibition. Many renowned designers as well as emerging designers still in fashion colleges and universities in northeast China presented diverse designs. The Dalian Cup International Youth Fashion Design Contest was also held for young designers during the fair.

According to the statistics from China National Textile and Apparel Council (CNTAC), China's textile and garment exports account for more than a third of the global total. This industry in China is reported to be benefiting greatly from international cooperation and innovation at home."
145,Restored silk fabrics from Sanxingdui Ruins unveiled for first time,"02:11

Using modern technology, Chinese archaeologists and researchers have restored silk fabrics from the Sanxingdui Ruins site in southwest China's Sichuan Province and unveiled them for the first time. What appeared to be ash on the surfaces of gold masks, bronze wares and other artifacts uncovered at the site turned out to be silk, according to China's cultural authorities. This is the first time silk and textile residue has been unearthed at the Sanxingdui Ruins, and the discovery advances the origin of silk in the Sichuan Basin to over 3,000 years ago, according to the archaeologists. The new findings indicate the ancient Shu Kingdom was one of the important origins of silk in ancient China, shedding light on the unified yet diverse origins of Chinese civilization.

After over half a year of research, crew members from the China National Silk Museum and Sichuan Provincial Cultural Relics and Archaeology Research Institute found that there were mainly three types of fabric.

""We found three types of fabrics at the Sanxingdui Ruins site this time, namely Juan, Qi and braided fabric,"" said Long Bo, an associate research fellow at the China National Silk Museum.

Sacrificial objects with spiritual meaning

The researchers discovered the fabric found in the No. 8 pit was juan (tough silk) after restoring it on a computer, but the exact color is very hard to identify due to erosion. Researchers at the China National Silk Museum used white and black pieces of paper to better show the structure of juan, and even illustrated how to produce it on site.

Zhou Yang, a research fellow at the museum said that silk was first used in sacrificial objects, and it was later used in tombs, as well as in ordinary people's daily clothing. The silk fabrics found at the Sanxingdui Ruins recently are sacrificial objects.

""The silk found in this sacrificial burial pit bears even more spiritual meaning, because we know that that scenario is for connecting heaven and earth, and connecting human and god, which has a certain religious meaning. So the silk found here is obviously different from those discovered in tombs or ruins,"" said Zhou.

Shedding light on the origin of Shu brocade

The discovery of silk fabrics at the Sanxingdui Ruins is of great significance to the historical research of the Sichuan silk, one of China's most famous brocades also known as Shu brocade (Shujin), and of the silk of Central Plains, according to Zhou. ""This time, through more cutting-edge scientific cognition methods, we found the existence of silk, and filled the vacancy of silk in the Sichuan Basin with archaeological evidence,"" noted Zhou.

On the basis of the new findings, the history of silk in the Sichuan Basin can be dated back to the Sanxingdui period, about 3,000 years ago during the Shang Dynasty (1600-1100 B.C.).

146,Future of work: Will breaking up with the office last forever?,"The past two years have been hard – many are still unable to travel around with COVID-19 restrictions still in place. Yet it has not stopped Zheng Zheng from discovering different coffee shops on a daily basis. She is not one of those internet influencers who check out different fancy cafes to make an income. Like millions who are taking on work-from-home positions, the project manager of an internet company sees it as a way to escape her cramped apartment and remain productive. ""As long as there's Wi-Fi, I can literally work anywhere,"" Zheng told CGTN. Many Silicon Valley executives have been rooting for the rise of remote working since 2020. Last May, Twitter announced its permanent work-from-home plans, calling the flexibility ""the fourth industrial revolution."" ""The future of work is offering employees more optionality,"" said Twitter human resources chief Jennifer Christie. Zheng agreed. ""[Remote working] gives me great flexibility. I could better assign my time, rather than wasting it on things like washing up or taking the subway to the office,"" she said during a Taihe Institute forum on the topic. ""Another great thing is, you can have different sources of income,"" the part-time designer and stylist added. Before returning home to China last January, Zheng had worked as a professional designer and stylist in Los Angeles for years.

Breaking up with the office

""But still, I believe remote working will never completely replace the traditional means of working,"" she said after sharing all the pros. One disadvantage she pointed out is missing out on social interactions with your colleagues, and another is the extended working hours. ""Sometimes, you will need to work 24/7 if you have international clients from both Hangzhou and the UK like I do. You answer their questions when you see them; it doesn't matter what time it is."" While flexible schedules have some obvious benefits, with research showing it generally increases employee happiness and productivity, making the break with the office is certainly more than just missing out on saying hi to your fellow coworkers. ""Face-to-face interaction is required to facilitate collaboration, build relationships, solve complex challenges and generate ideas. Continuous remote work extends the workday, diffuses work-life boundaries and reduces mental well-being,"" Indranil Roy, executive director of Deloitte's Human Capital Department, said in an interview with the BBC.

In a University of Chicago study, employees were found to work longer hours at home for the same task, as focused time was broken up by domestic distractions like childcare and online meetings. Robin Dunbar, emeritus professor of Experimental Psychology at the University of Oxford, told the BBC that he believes remote working is overhyped and certainly won't last long. ""Without face-to-face engagement and those casual meetings round the coffee machine, the 'flow' that makes things work and work fast will be missing. Work groups quickly lose focus, and the sense of belonging – and of commitment to the organization and its aims and objectives – is very quickly lost,"" the BBC quoted Dunbar as saying.

Hybrid work model

""That's why occasionally, I'd still need to be there, say in the factory, and check out the product's quality there,"" Zheng told CGTN. Her work mode is what is now called ""hybrid working,"" which consists of a mixture of home and office work. As time passed and the first wave of coronavirus variants abated only to be followed by the second, companies started to shift to a more hybrid work model, which is expected to give the best of both worlds. Many other urban dwellers share the same sentiment, hoping to get a balance between staying around with colleagues and the efficiencies gained by working remotely. According to a report released by professional networking site LinkedIn this September, 57 percent of the over 1,000 participants in China said they prefer the hybrid model, while 11 percent would choose work from home completely. The same trend has also been seen in the world's biggest economy. In a survey conducted by Stanford University in May 2020, 55 percent of U.S. workers said they want a mixture of onsite and remote working.

A timely film about illegal abortions in 1960s France won the Venice Film Festival's Golden Lion on Saturday, capping a festival rife with female-focused themes.

The film, titled ""Happening,"" wowed viewers on the Lido waterfront with its portrayal of a young woman desperate to arrange a termination to continue with her studies at a time when an abortion could mean a prison term or death.

Directed by Audrey Diwan, the movie is set in France in 1963. But its central theme is as relevant today as it was then, a visibly moved Diwan told the audience, just as the debate about abortion rages again in the United States following new restrictions in Texas.

""I did this movie with anger, with desire, with my belly, my guts, my heart and my head,"" said Diwan, accepting the top prize for her delicately rendered yet gut-punching drama.

In a strong night for women filmmakers, best director went to iconic New Zealand auteur Jane Campion for her emotionally complex Western ""The Power of the Dog,"" starring Benedict Cumberbatch.

The best screenplay award went to Maggie Gyllenhaal for her directorial debut ""The Lost Daughter,"" an unflinching look at the difficulties of balancing career and motherhood starring British Oscar-winner Olivia Colman."

151,Disney to debut rest of 2021 films in cinemas first,"Disney announced Friday that all of its films slated for release by the end of the year will be exclusively screened in cinemas first, bringing relief to theaters anxious to reconnect with audiences after the coronavirus pandemic devastated their industry.



The animated film ""Encanto"" will be released on the big screen on November 24 and will not appear on Disney's on-demand video platform until December 24, the company said in a statement.



Other planned projects, including ""The Last Duel"" by Ridley Scott, ""Eternals"" by Marvel Studios and ""West Side Story"" by Steven Spielberg, will be screened in theaters for at least 45 days before they are released elsewhere.



The decision was eagerly awaited by traditional cinemas after the entertainment giant recently chose to release a series of big productions such as ""Black Widow"", ""Jungle Cruise"" and ""Cruella"" on its Disney+ platform, diverting part of their revenue.



""Black Widow"" actor Scarlett Johansson has sued Disney, accusing the company of breach of contract and costing her millions of dollars in box office revenue after it released the film on its video platform.



Two years ago, Disney was producing content for both theaters and television channels, but it now has direct access to its audience via streaming, a trend accelerated by the pandemic.



In mid-August, Disney boss Bob Chapek said he favored ""flexibility"" and the ability to ""follow the consumer wherever he goes"".



During a presentation of the company's financial results, he said ""when theaters reopened, there was immense reluctance from the public to return"".



Warner Bros. studios has also been heavily criticised for its decision to release all of its new movies for the rest of the year on its HBO Max platform."

China's Ministry of Culture and Tourism Thursday required the whole system to intensify regulations on salient problems in culture and entertainment.

Culture and tourism administrative organs at all levels and public cultural institutions were asked at a video conference to fully implement requirements on the entertainment industry and impose harsher punishments against rule violations.

The ministry will strengthen education on moral standards for all practitioners in the entertainment sector.

Operations of entertainment agents should be regulated, and the responsibilities of entertainment companies should be clearly defined, the ministry stressed.

Regular training should be established for the industry, and routine supervision should improve, the ministry said.

Thailand plans to reopen Bangkok to fully vaccinated visitors in October, officials said on Friday, as the kingdom seeks to salvage a tourism industry hammered by the COVID-19 pandemic. Tourism made up a fifth of Thailand's national income in 2019 but severe travel curbs imposed to fight the virus saw the usual flood of foreign visitors dwindle to almost nothing, contributing to the economy's worst performance in over 20 years. The kingdom is pressing ahead with plans to reopen despite a deadly third wave of infections, driven by the Delta variant.

The Tourism Authority of Thailand said that from October 1, fully vaccinated foreign travellers will be able to visit Bangkok and four other provinces without undergoing two weeks' hotel quarantine. Instead, the five areas – also including Chiang Mai, Chon Buri, Phetchaburi and Prachuap Khiri Khan provinces – are expected to follow a ""sandbox"" model of the type piloted since July in the holiday island of Phuket. Under the Sandbox scheme, tourists have to stay within a certain area for seven days after arrival and take COVID-19 tests.

Later in October, 21 more destinations will be added to the list including Chiang Rai, Sukhothai and popular seaside getaway Rayong. But Thailand's third and deadliest COVID-19 wave has not yet fully subsided, and the tourism agency warned the plans could change. Thailand got through 2020 relatively unscathed by COVID-19, recording low numbers of infections, but since April, the Delta variant has taken hold and cases have soared to more than 1.3 million, with almost 14,000 deaths. More than 29,000 fully vaccinated international visitors hit the beach at Phuket under its Sandbox scheme (since July), generating nearly $50 million dollars in revenue according to government spokesman Thanakorn Wangboonkongchana. Three more Thai islands also reopened – Samui, Tao and Phangan – with slightly more onerous restrictions. One cloud hanging over Thailand's tourism revival plans is the travel advice of other countries discouraging would-be tourists from visiting. Britain and the United States have warned against travel to Thailand because of rising case numbers and low vaccination rates. About 16 percent of the Thai population have received two coronavirus vaccine doses, the government's COVID-19 task force said.

158,Rural teacher lights up children's lives with singing,"04:34

Jibu Xiaolong has a full schedule every day. After giving all lessons to students, he continues to coach the members of his choir. Writing songs, playing instruments and teaching his students how to sing, for the 35-year-old teacher, music is an integral part of his life, and it is also changing the children from somewhere once known as one of China's poorest regions in a special way. He describes this a way of realizing the children's dream, but also his own dream. A dream-chaser from mountainous village Xiaolong was born in Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture in southwest China's Sichuan Province, home to the largest population of the Yi ethnic group. For centuries, it was isolated from the world, with all residents struggling in deep poverty. Xiaolong's affection for music started in middle school when he received a guitar from his father as a gift, something deemed as a luxury back then. He was later admitted to the Sichuan Conservatory of Music, a great honor in a place where very few people could receive college education due to poverty. ""But I dared not sing in the beginning, as most of my classmates received professional training during high school and could sing very well. I didn't even know how to do solfeggio and ear training,"" Xiaolong recalled.

Jibu Xiaolong used to perform in various occasions before he started working as a teacher. /Jibu Xiaolong Jibu Xiaolong used to perform in various occasions before he started working as a teacher. /Jibu Xiaolong

Yet his passion has never faded, and he gradually regained confidence as his horizon was broadened in the provincial capital. Following his graduation, he chose to pursue his dream as a singer in different cities, including Beijing, where he participated in some music talent shows and performed part-time in various occasions. It's an adventure full of excitement as well as setbacks. The ambitious young man didn't get many opportunities as expected at a time when young dream seekers were flourishing. He said in the most difficult period of time, he couldn't even afford a guitar worth of 300 yuan ($47). Then he decided to go back home. ""I love singing and playing instruments. I thought it would be great if I could help children in my hometown enjoy music and bring them happiness through singing,"" Xiaolong said. An educator with experience from big cities In 2012, Xiaolong took up work as an elementary school teacher in Liangshan. Apart from music, he also taught other subjects like math as well, a common practice in many rural areas where teachers are scarce. In the first few years, Xiaolong tried to create a children's choir, but his attempts all failed as students were all too shy to sing. ""They even blushed when I talked to them,"" he said.

Jibu Xiaolong and his choir members sing in the open air. Yang Jinghao/CGTN Jibu Xiaolong and his choir members sing in the open air. Yang Jinghao/CGTN

In 2018, he finally found four children who would like to sing with him at the school he currently works at in Puge County. He also started to write songs on his own, in both Chinese and Yi ethnic language, all focusing on the children's childhood life and beautiful hometown. The melodious works have attracted a growing number of students. Now, the choir named ""Niuniu,"" meaning little girls, have some 40 members. Xiaolong explained that many boys were naughty and felt embarrassed to sing together with girls, and so the group gradually became exclusively for girls. For these students who've never walked out of their mountainous home, music has changed them quite a bit. ""Having stayed in the choir for one and a half years, I'm getting a lot more daring. I was once shy, but now I like to laugh all the time,"" said six-grader Aniu Wuge.

Two girls play with Jibu Xiaolong's guitar. Zhang Kai/CGTN Two girls play with Jibu Xiaolong's guitar. Zhang Kai/CGTN

Many of the members are so-called ""left-behind"" children, as their parents seek employment far away from home. For them, music means much more. ""When I miss my parents, I always sing the songs Xiaolong writes for us, especially one called 'Brave Niuniu,' as one line says 'I can look after myself even when mom and dad aren't home,'"" said choir member Asheng Wuzhi. A pathfinder of 'left-behind' children Xiaolong said he felt upset when he just came back and started his teaching career, as what he was still longing for stages to perform. But now, the choir has allowed him to create a close bond with the children, bringing him a sense of accomplishment. ""Sometimes I feel as if they're carrying on my dream. I was pursuing my own dream before, but I feel what I'm doing now is more meaningful, as it allows me to help these children in my own special way,"" he said.

Jibu Xiaolong and his choir members read comments from netizens towards their performance. Yang Jinghao/CGTN Jibu Xiaolong and his choir members read comments from netizens towards their performance. Yang Jinghao/CGTN

He also posts the children's singing at some popular video-sharing platforms like Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok, gaining much popularity. This has brought much confidence to both Xiaolong and the members. Xiaolong is currently trying to seek more performance opportunities for the children in order to expand their horizons and to share the Yi culture with a larger audience. ""If they can take a look at the outside world, they would plant a seed for a better future in their heart and then study harder,"" said Xiaolong. He added that they will not participate in any commercial performances. Earlier this year, they were invited to perform in a music festival in Beijing, but the trip was canceled due to the COVID-19 epidemic, a great disappointment for the girls. ""I hope we can have more opportunities to perform on big stages, really big ones. I really hope I can see more of the world,"" said choir member Axi Wuguo.

An axe-shaped piece of gold ware has been found at the No. 5 sacrificial pit of the Sanxingdui Ruins site in southwest China's Sichuan Province amid the ongoing excavation at the 3,000-year-old treasure house.

Among the six new sacrificial pits found in March, pit No. 5, though the smallest in size, contains the largest number of gold pieces.

The newfound item is likely to be the next most important gold artifact found from the pit after the half-face gold mask which was unearthed in March, according to Li Haichao, an archaeologist in charge of the pit.

Currently, 7 centimeters in length is exposed. Its shape resembles an axe with a curved blade in the front and three grooves on the surface. It has not yet been confirmed whether the piece is actually an axe or an ornament belonging to another artifact.

What has surprised the archaeologists is its thickness. Other gold artifacts found in the same pit are around 1 millimeter thick, but this one is about three millimeters thick."

""The widest part, from one tip of the ear to the other, is 136 centimeters and the height is roughly 75 centimeters,"" said Xu. It was unearthed from the central part of the No.3 pit, the mask is with complicated burial conditions.

Since six more pits were found in March, the widely anticipated archaeological excavation of the Sanxingdui Ruins site has been proceeding, yielding approximately 10,000 cultural relics dating back over 3,000 years, according to the Sichuan Provincial Cultural Relics and Archaeology Research Institute."

The competition is organized by the tourism bureau of Beijing's Dongcheng District. Last year's inaugural event attracted around 2,300 students from some 300 colleges and universities across China. This year, it aims for an even wider reach, taking the creativity out of campuses for interpretations of Beijing's cultural heritage.

""Dongcheng District is one of the core regions of Beijing. It's not very large in area, but it boasts lots of cultural heritage and resources,"" said Song Xu, deputy director of the Dongcheng District Culture and Tourism Bureau.

Song added that the traditional culture of Xicheng District is especially rich and diverse. She hoped that the event will be a new way to promote China's traditional culture and allow more people to appreciate its charm and beauty.

One of the contest's top priorities is to target young people, and organizers look forward to seeing themselves through young people's perspectives.

Activities will take place in four major venues: the Grand Canal, East of Forbidden City, and two other venues for jewelry design and functional games. The contest will cover themes and cultural elements from ancient and modern China.

Perfect World played a major role in the endeavor. Ruby Wang, senior vice president and spokesperson for Perfect World, said that as a co-organizer of the competition, the company is trying to blend the modern creative industry's ethos with China's cultural tradition.

The prominent company has been exploring this particular field for many years, and has often seen fundamental values shared by the modern and traditional. As a generator of creativity, any company would have its limits. The contest forms part of the company's mission to involve young people and work with other sectors such as high technology.

Eight of Beijing's most prestigious museums will allow access to some collections and archives. Design entries can be sent through a WeChat platform or the official website of Perfect World Company. Submissions will be accepted from Friday to November 10.

""Maybe God was playing a joke on me,"" he said, laughing.

Luo has been unable to see since birth. His parents spent many years taking him from doctor to doctor to get help but couldn't succeed.

Twenty-three-year-old Luo is a practitioner of tui na – a traditional Chinese therapy that involves massage and other manipulation of the body. Unfortunately, his limited light perception means he sees nothing more than shadows. But it doesn't prevent him from challenging himself.

""It was my childhood dream to drive a car,"" said Luo Chenhao as he presses his foot on the accelerator during a road trip to Hulunbuir Grassland in north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. But, until this moment, Luo was always convinced that his dream would never come true, for he has a severe visual impairment.

Growing up, Luo realized that, for a blind person, there were few opportunities to work. His teachers advised him to set up a massage business to earn a living, as this would require only some vocational training. But Luo wanted more.

""I thought I was capable of studying at university,"" he said, ""just like any normally-sighted person. So, why not give it a shot?""

After three years at Zhejiang Pharmaceutical College in east China, he attended the special entrance exam for the visually impaired and was offered a place at Beijing Union University to study acupuncture and tui na.

He also attended three years of further education, finally receiving a bachelor's degree in medicine. After getting the qualification, he was offered a job as a therapist at Hangzhou Tui Na Hospital.

A life-changing hike

Working as a tui na physical therapist provides Luo with a steady income and a comfortable lifestyle. However, by 2018 he was finding the work pressure challenging to handle. So he signed up for a mountain hiking trip designed especially for the visually impaired to escape the stress.

It was the first time he had traveled without his family.

""When we reached the mountain top, I could sense the wide-open landscape,"" Luo recalled. ""I felt my heart had been purified.""

The experience convinced him that he should travel more often.

Reconnecting with society

""You probably consider seeing stunning scenery as the purpose of a trip,"" Luo said. ""In our case, taking a plane for the first time, traveling by train in a sleeping berth… All of these are my experience of a trip.""

But that's not to say that the visually impaired are unable to appreciate nature. On the contrary, many of them, like Luo, can use their senses such as smell, hearing and touch to create a picture of their surroundings in their minds."

Much of what makes Ningxia special, according to the brand new stunningly produced documentary ""A Fertile Land,"" the first season of ""In the Arms of the Yellow River,"" is down to its relationship with the Yellow River.

Indeed, you could say that Ningxia owes everything to China's mother river – the stunning topography that draws sightseers from far and wide, the rich silts laid down by the river over the centuries laying the foundations for the prosperity of Ningxia's jujube growers and the growing fame of its wine industry. In short, for Ningxia, the gifts are given by the Yellow River.

But despite its relatively laid-back lifestyle, the Ningxia portrayed in the film is far from backward-looking.

Whether it's refashioning age-old musical traditions into innovative folk rock, transforming the once-indispensable skin-rafts into an eco-tourism attraction, this documentary is full of examples of a dynamic Ningxia culture that, just like the great Yellow River that gave birth to it and the whole of Chinese civilization, is determined to keep flowing on into the future."
164,China unveils new major discoveries from Sanxingdui Ruins site,"Chinese archaeologists on Thursday unveiled new major discoveries at six newly found sacrificial pits at the Sanxingdui Ruins site in southwest China's Sichuan Province, mostly from pits No. 3, No.4, No. 7 and No. 8. After a period of on-site work, pits No. 7 and No. 8 have been excavated to the utensil layer, where a large amount of ivory fragments were uncovered. The process of excavation at the No. 3 pit has entered the final stage with a new bronze sacred tree unearthed at the pit earlier and most of the cultural relics being cleaned and restored currently.

The much anticipated archaeological excavation of the Sanxingdui Ruins site has been underway, with nearly 10,000 cultural relics dating back about 3,000 years unearthed so far, since the site announced the discovery of six more pits in March.

01:00

In 1986, archaeologists found two large-scale sacrificial pits with thousands of rare ancient treasures at the Sanxingdui Ruins site, which offers great historical evidence of the ancient Shu Kingdom from 5,000 years ago and is considered one of the most important ancient remains in the world.

Rare giant bronze vessels from No. 8 sacrificial pit

Some very rare and important large bronze vessels were uncovered from the No. 8 sacrificial pit during the recent excavation, among which there are likely to be new national treasures. The No. 8 sacrificial pit at the southwestern part of the archaeological site is the largest in size, measuring 5.1 meters in length and 3.8 meters in width. It covers an area of nearly 20 square meters – five times that of pit No. 5. After the archaeological team cleaned up the upper soil-filled and ash layers, a significant number of ivory items were found at the utensil layer, covering almost the entire pit, with some large bronze vessels disclosed in some corners. According to the archaeologists at the site, it could be distinguished from the exposed parts that these bronze items are unique in shape and have never been seen before.

Lots of ivory and jade wares from No. 7 sacrificial pit

A large number of ivory relics were unearthed from the No. 7 sacrificial pit, but no bronze objects have been located underneath the ivory so far, according to archaeologists at the site, who found numerous jade artifacts instead. The archaeologists have discovered jade zhang (jade tablets) and jade zao (chisels), as well as many other types of jade artifacts that have never been seen before. Further excavation and research continue to be carried out.

All cultural relics in No. 4 sacrificial pit extracted

All the cultural relics in the No. 4 sacrificial pit have been extracted, with 79 complete objects and 1,073 fragments unearthed. According to archaeologists, 478 pieces (sets) of relics are relatively complete, and 141 are fragments. Cultural relics still intact include nine jade artifacts, 21 bronze objects, 47 ivory items and two pottery items. Intact artifacts include two jade cong (jade tube with a square cross-section and a circular hole), one jade yuan (jade ring), four jade zao (jade chisel), one jade bi (flat jade disc), one jade ben (jade adze).

Based on the research on the soil from the pit, archaeologists believe that No. 4 pit dates back between 3,148 to 2,966 years during the late Shang Dynasty (1600-1046 BC).

Cultural relics from No. 3 pit being cleaned and restored

The excavation of No. 3 pit, which is rich in cultural relics and artifacts, has entered the final stage, and most of the key treasures have been extracted. A total of 729 pieces of various cultural relics have been unearthed from the pit so far, and among them, there are 478 pieces of complete relics and 141 fragments. Newly found complete artifacts include 293 bronze objects, 45 jade objects, 100 ivory items, seven gold objects, two bone carvings, two stone tools, 26 pieces of sea shells, and three unknown items. Among them, there is an intact jade cong with sacred tree pattern, offering essential evidence for the study of the meaning and symbolism of the sacred tree in ancient Shu society.

165,Xi Jinping sends greetings to teachers ahead of Teachers' Day,"Chinese President Xi Jinping has called on teachers to provide good guidance to students in a greeting to educators across the country ahead of China's Teachers' Day, which falls on Friday.



Xi, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission, made the remarks on Wednesday in a letter to representatives of model teaching units named after late geophysicist at Jilin University Huang Danian, who helped China make advances in deep earth exploration.



Xi praised the representatives for their achievements in teaching and scientific research and innovation, noting that they have followed Huang's example in their work.



He encouraged them and college teachers across China to provide good guidance to students and make new contributions to the cause of fully building a modern socialist country.



Huang, known for his expertise in deep earth exploration technology, studied and worked in Britain for 18 years before returning to China in 2009. Over the ensuing years, he helped China soar in a number of technical fields, transforming the nation into a world leader in deep earth exploration. He died in January 2017 at the age of 58.



Xi called on the whole society to learn from the late geophysicist and hailed his outstanding contributions in education and scientific research in a written instruction in May 2017.



The Ministry of Education launched a nationwide campaign in colleges and universities in 2017 to form model teaching units named after Huang. The first batch of 201 teaching units from 200 colleges and universities was identified in the campaign.



The representatives of these teaching units wrote a letter to Xi recently about their work and expressed determination to contribute to China's national rejuvenation.

169,New treasure: Bronze sacred tree unearthed from Sanxingdui Ruins site,"A new bronze sacred tree has been unearthed from the No. 3 pit of the Sanxingdui Ruins site in southwest China's Sichuan Province following months of excavation efforts.

Earlier in March, Chinese archaeologists discovered six new sacrificial pits at the ancient ruins site with hundreds of artifacts discovered, among which the No. 3 sacrificial pit was found housing over 100 pieces ivory and bronze ware.

Xu Feihong, team head in charge of the No. 3 pit's excavation, said part of the bronze sacred tree was exposed at the center of the pit in March. However, it took some four months to complete the job as the trunk was pressed tightly with ivory artifacts buried under piles of other items.

The newly unearthed sacred tree wasn't the only of its kind found at Sanxingdui. Back in 1986, several sacred trees were found in No. 2 pit, of which only three could be restored and numbered in sequence.

According to Xu, the new one is similar to the No. 2 bronze tree which took archaeologists over a decade to restore. Yet, it's still not complete with several parts missing.

""It cannot be ruled out that these two might belong to the same tree. If the two sacred trees in pits No. 2 and No. 3 are put together, they can explain a lot of academic issues,"" said Xu.

Hailed as one of the most important ancient remains found in the 20th century, the Sanxingdui Ruins site is a treasure house filled with a trove of pottery, jade, bronze, and gold wares dating back some 3,000 years.

Excavation is still going on at the sacrificial pits and more treasures are to be brought to light.

The new rules state clearly that scientifically defined, well protected and efficiently managed systems for the preservation and inheritance of urban and rural history must be developed, Yang Baojun, chief economist at the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development, said during a state council press conference on Wednesday.



Different kinds of historical and cultural heritage need to be well protected, Yang said. Places like historical cities, old towns, traditional villages, time-honored blocks, immovable cultural relics, irrigation engineering heritage all need to be preserved as a whole. A management system for the protection and inheritance needs to be established, Yang added.

During this solar term, tea lovers are in for a treat: White dew tea is finally ready to be tasted. Unlike spring tea, which is tender and light, or summer tea, which is dry and bitter, white dew tea has a distinctively mellow taste. This fresh taste is inseparable from the weather characteristics of the White Dew term.

White Dew is the dividing line between hot and cold: from this point on, the summer heat fades, and the difference in temperature between day and night gradually widens. As a result, dew can always be found on tree leaves and blades of grass in the early morning during this time of year. The White Dew term is an excellent growth period for tea after the intense heat. And since people are in the habit of gathering morning dew at this time of the year, the tea brewed with this dew has the fragrance of plants and flowers. Not as light as spring tea, nor as bitter as summer tea, the layered taste makes it a favored treat for tea lovers.

Editor's Note: The recent findings of over 1,300 unmarked graves near former indigenous residential schools in Canada once again came as a shock to the international community. Yet, many survivors say these are just the tip of the iceberg. The series intends to throw some light on Canada's dark past. ""The Indian population of Canada has a mortality rate of more than double that of the whole population, and in some provinces more than three times,"" Peter Bryce, a Canadian doctor who was appointed the head medical officer for Indian Affairs in 1904, noted in his annual report in 1906. A year later, after spending months visiting dozens of indigenous residential schools in western Canada, Bryce recorded the high death rate of students at residential schools, some as high as 50 percent, and called it a ""national crime."" Tuberculosis, deaths, and vaccine tests According to Bryce, the highly infectious disease of tuberculosis (TB) was the main cause of indigenous children's deaths at residential schools, and healthy children were deliberately exposed to those carrying the airborne disease.

""We were forced to play with them. The nuns made us play with those kids,"" Virginia Baptiste, a survivor of the St. Eugene's Mission School in British Columbia, said in the documentary ""Unrepentant: Kevin Annett and Canada's Genocide"" (2006). ""We didn't want to get sick either, but they were forcing us to play with those kids, and also they made some of them sleep with the other kids too,"" Baptiste recalled. Directed by Canadian director Louie Lawless, the 106-minute documentary chronicles the country's genocide of its indigenous people at church-run residential schools by drawing upon testimonies of residential school survivors and personal experiences of Kevin Annett, a former minister of St. Andrew's United Church who was expelled from his ministry in 1997.

For decades, indigenous people were treated at segregated tuberculosis sanatoriums and government-run ""Indian hospitals"" where abuses and medical experimentation were reported by survivors, according to CBC News, the country's largest news broadcaster. Maureen Lux, a medical historian at Brock University, said in her research published in 1998 that indigenous children were used as subjects of a TB vaccine trial in the province of Saskatchewan in the 1930s.

179,Charity to play bigger role as country encourages 'third distribution',"02:18

Sunday marks China's 6th Charity Day. In recent years, philanthropy has taken a bigger role in life in China. And more charities are expected to form, as the government focuses on ""common prosperity"", a concept aiming to ease inequality. This year's ""Charity Day"" comes after an economic leadership meeting in mid-August, which encouraged ""third distribution"" as another key approach to achieving ""common prosperity"". Third distribution means creating opportunities for high-income groups and enterprises to give back. Charity is key to that. Bei Xiaochao is the Secretary General of Chinese Red Cross Foundation, one of the major charity groups in China that focuses on improving national health through charitable means.

""This is a major signal and a major opportunity for the entire sector. We believe that a more favorable policy environment will be created for charity,"" Bei told CGTN, ""In the future, the relevant laws and regulations for charitable organizations will become better, and the fiscal and taxation policies will encourage more donations."" Charity groups believe the potential policy adjustments at the national level will further increase charitable donations. According to Liu Wenkui, secretary general of the China Foundation for Poverty Alleviation, people, especially individuals, in the country are more enthusiast to participate in charity over the last few years.

""In our foundation, individuals accounted for less than 20 percent of the total donations 10 years ago; but these years, the percentage has increased. In the last two years, individual donations have remained above 40 percent That shows the public's enthusiasm for charity has greatly increased,"" Liu said.

Yet, many survivors say these are just the tip of the iceberg. The series intends to throw some light on Canada's dark past.

""You better behave, don't get out of line because there's the graveyard, and there's also the river, those were warnings that were given to us as little tiny children,"" Barbara McNab-Larson, one of the survivors of Canada's Kamloops Indian Residential School said during an interview with CBC News, the largest news broadcaster in the country.

More than 150,000 Indigenous children were forced to attend state-funded Christian boarding schools from the 19th century through the 1970s in an effort to assimilate them into Canadian society. Thousands of children died there, many of whom were never reunited with their families, as a result of sickness and other causes.



The national humiliation of the schools has resurfaced as a topic of discussion across the country.

Physical and sexual abuse in the schools

Physical and sexual assault were rampant in schools, with students being beaten for speaking their native languages, according to the Canadian government.



""I used to have to run away during the night to get away from that nun,"" said Fred Gordon, a residential school survivor told CTV News Channel. He said he was sexually abused by a nun while at Lebret Indian Industrial Residential School from 1944 to 1951. As a result of the abuse, Gordon was left deaf in one ear and blind in his left eye.



Gordon stated his experience at the residential school still has an impact on facets of his life today, despite the fact that it occurred many years ago.

""Everything was done with a physical"" hand at the school, and children were frequently slapped, punched and kicked, among other abuses, Barry Kennedy, a survivor of the Marieval residential school told CBC.



""We were called to the church one early morning,"" recalled Kennedy. ""We were brought outside and they were burying someone. Who it was, whether it was a boy or a girl, I don't know. But what I do know is that this individual was wrapped in a sheet and there was a hole dug.""



""That's what you're faced with - that along with the confusion of wondering where's your family, that along with the confusion of being lonely,"" Kennedy added.

""They came and took us in big cattle trucks,"" Evelyn Camille, a Kamloops Indian Residential School survivor said during an interview with AFP in June this year.

184,German designer's modern fashion with traditional Chinese textile,"Foreigners were the first batch of renters of Beijing courtyard houses after China's reform and opening-up process began, and many are still fascinated by the authentic Beijinger lifestyle of living in courtyard houses in hutongs – old alleys and narrow streets typically found in Beijing.

Among them is a German fashion designer, Kathrin von Rechenberg, who has been living in Beijing for over 20 years. She is now doing business in a hutong area near the downtown Qianmen Street with her Chinese husband.

What brought Rechenberg to China was a special fabric, Xiang Yun Sha, also known as Liang silk or tea silk.

In 1995, Rechenberg was intrigued by the fabric she saw in Paris. She came to China to look for it in 2000 and then settled down in the country as a designer.

Rechenberg said she was fascinated by the paper-like textile – silky, light, thin and stiff. It is cooling because it does not stick to the skin and has a special shiny glamor, she added.

Every year, Rechenberg goes to south China's Guangdong Province twice to make sure her material is treated the right way.

Xiang Yun Sha is made by being dyed with a plant found in Shunde, Guangdong Province. Its produce process takes more than a dozen intricate steps. Experienced craftsmen will guarantee the right amount of plant juice, sea mud and how long it is dyed, coated with mud and baked under the sun.

Xiang Yun Sha has been a famous product of Shunde since the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644).

Rechenberg, who studied and worked in the Paris fashion scene for eight years, has injected the haute couture spirit into her designs leveraging these special silk garments.

Her collection graced Beijing Fashion Week last autumn. Models attended a contest, wearing her simple yet elegant garments.

The designer said she tries to keep her designs simple, avoiding too much work on the fabric.

""For me, always the fabric comes first and design is following,"" Rechenberg said, adding that she wants to use every part of the material.

She said that the craftsmanship of making Xiang Yun Sha should be honored, comparing it to good wine.

The fabric is rare at a length of 15 meters per roll and needs to be stored for several years until the right color and shine appear, Rechenberg explained."
185,Italian Renaissance drawings set for Beijing debut,"Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo Buonarroti, Raphael Sanzio, Polidoro da Caravaggio and Titian Vecellio – the drawings of those great names of Italian Renaissance will soon be exhibited in China.

The exhibition titled ""Italian Renaissance: a dialogue with China"" opens at the M Woods Museum in Beijing on Wednesday, marking the first time the British Museum has cooperated with a private Chinese art museum.

The exhibition features the works of artists active on the Italian Peninsula from 1470 to 1580 and is divided into six themes: People, movement, light, clothing, nature and narrative. It delves into how artists from the Renaissance and China used elements such as movement, light and shadow to give life and motion to their creations.

The exhibition was co-curated by juxtaposing Renaissance works with Chinese contemporary art to explore the connection between the Western Renaissance and China across time and space.

""By juxtaposing the works of Renaissance artists with those of contemporary Chinese artists, the exhibition reexamines these historical works from a cross-cultural global perspective,"" said Wang Zongfu, the curator and art director of M Woods Museum, adding that it will open up a new context to explore the parallels and interconnections between these different perspectives and history.

As a response to Renaissance art, several pieces of contemporary Chinese art were created specifically for this exhibition including works by Jin Shangyi and Zeng Fanzhi.

In addition, the exhibition also presents the works of Jiang Baili, Hu Shi, Liang Sicheng, Fu Lei and other key figures in the progress of the Chinese cultural movement in the form of documentary material.

The ""Italian Renaissance: a dialogue with China"" will be open until February 20, 2022."

""Hong Kong has been Chinese territory since ancient times, even when Hong Kong was occupied by Britain after the Opium War (1840-1842), it was still Chinese territory,"" students from Hon Wah College in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) were told in their first class of the new ""citizenship and social development"" curriculum on Thursday.



The class was the first since the controversial liberal studies subject was officially renamed ""citizenship and social development,"" which is regarded as a key stride in HKSAR's education reform, according to Xinhua.

Disputed liberal studies need reform in HKSAR

Liberal studies, one of the four compulsory subjects taught to senior secondary school students since 2009, has been included as a required subject in the Hong Kong College Entrance Examination since 2012. However, its curriculum and evaluation procedures have been questioned since its inception, and have been blamed by Lo Man-tuen, executive director of Hong Kong Association for Promotion of Peaceful Reunification of China Limited, for radicalizing the younger generation.



For example, it included controversial content featuring attacks on ""One Country, Two Systems,"" applauding the illegal ""Occupy Central"" movement, using outdated data when introducing the Chinese mainland, and citing one-sided conclusions about China from a Western perspective.



In November 2020, the Education Bureau (EDB) of the HKSAR government announced plans to streamline liberal studies content and consolidate the knowledge base in accordance with the purpose and objectives of the courses, with new subject titles.

Content related to national security, lawfulness and patriotism are emphasized under the revamp, education authorities revealed in February.



""The curriculum of citizenship and social development is more concentrated,"" said Lai Kwok-chio, a teacher at Hon Wah College. ""The new curriculum discusses the pace of the country's development in more depth and will give students a positive message.""

Editor's Note: The recent findings of over 1,000 unmarked graves near former indigenous residential schools in Canada once again came as a shock to the international community. Yet, many survivors say these are just the tip of the iceberg. The series intends to throw some light on Canada's dark past.

""The residential school history within Canada is one of the greatest tragedies, if not the greatest tragedy, in our whole history as a country,"" said church minister Teresa Jones at Lebanese filmmaker Rania Rafei's 40-minute documentary ""Canada's Dark Secret"" (2017). The past months have seen over 1,300 unmarked graves discovered near the sites of former church-run indigenous residential schools in western Canada that appalled people across the world. The latest finding was on July 12, when more than 160 unmarked graves were found around the Kuper Island Industrial School in British Columbia. Before that, remains of 182 indigenous children were discovered near St. Eugene's Mission School in British Columbia on June 30; around 751 unmarked graves were found near Marieval Indian Residential School in Saskatchewan on June 24; another 215 were found near the site of the former Kamloops Indian Residential School in British Columbia on May 27, some as young as three years old. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called these discoveries ""a shameful reminder of the systemic racism, discrimination, and injustice that Indigenous peoples have faced and continue to face in this country.""

Eradication of indigenous culture for over a century After years of investigation and research, Canada's Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) in 2015 concluded that the establishment and operation of residential schools in the country can best be described as ""cultural genocide."" ""The schools were part of a larger effort by Canadian authorities to force Indigenous peoples to assimilate by the outlawing of sacred ceremonies and important traditions,"" said Murray Sinclair, a former Canadian senator and Chair of the TRC. ""It is clear that residential schools were a key component of a Canadian government policy of cultural genocide."" Back in 1876, the Indian Act was passed by the Canadian government, aiming to administer and assimilate the country's indigenous population. Residential schools were then set up to serve the very purpose. Some 150,000 indigenous school-age children across the country were forcibly taken away from their families and sent to these church-run boarding schools between 1863 and 1996, according to the TRC, where they were indoctrinated into the dominant Euro-Canadian and Christian way of life.

""In order to sever those ties in your culture, in your language, they had to separate children from families and communities,"" Roberta Hill, a residential school survivor, said in the documentary. ""We wore uniforms. We all dressed the same. You had your hair cut the same. You were all one,"" Hill recalled her school years at the Mohawk Institute Indian Residential School in Brantford, Ontario, from 1957 to 1961. Students were banned from wearing traditional clothes or performing cultural practices, nor allowed to speak their mother tongue. ""They took us to the church every Sunday. We had to say prayers and things like that. We weren't allowed to talk in our language. We had to speak English,"" said Bud Whiteye, another residential school survivor. As Canada's census in 2016 shows, 15.6 percent of the Aboriginal population in the country are able to converse in an Aboriginal language – a sharp drop from 21.4 percent in 2006. Many of the indigenous languages are spoken by less than 10,000 people, some by only hundreds.

""I know from my own experience, people that I've known, they were raised by whites in the residential schools. So when they were finished there, their parents didn't accept them because they weren't native. And the white community did not accept them because they were native,"" Ron Shortt, former Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) officer said. ""So these people, 150,000 children, grew up in limbo with no roots, no background and no place they could call home,"" Shortt added."

Universal Beijing Resort (UBR), a new landmark in China's capital Beijing that is set to open to the public on September 20, began trial operations on Wednesday, offering eager invited visitors a sneak peek into the world's largest Universal Studios-branded theme park. Situated in east Beijing's sub-center Tongzhou District and spanning four square kilometers, the resort includes the Universal Studios theme park, a Universal CityWalk commercial complex and two destination hotels – the first-ever Universal-themed hotel, Universal Studios Grand Hotel, and NUO Resort Hotel, which is inspired by the architectural grandeur of China's Old Summer Palace. According to the UBR, during the trial run, the resort is only open to invited guests, including business partners and a limited group of fans chosen from a marketing campaign. A series of initiatives adopted across the resort reinforce COVID-19 protocols.

Tom Mehrmann, UBR's president and general manager, noted earlier that the resort's rides, entertainment facilities and performances would run at a reduced capacity. ""Rides and shows may open and close based on what we are learning and hearing from guests, so we can make adjustments,"" he said. Featuring the seven themed zones filled with 37 rides, Beijing's new tourist destination observes a blend of Eastern and Western movie elements, including Kung Fu Panda, Harry Potter, Jurassic World, Minion, Transformers, Waterworld, as well as several famous figures of Hollywood. The first Universal Studios-branded theme park in the country, the resort features experiences designed to reflect China's cultural heritage.

More than a magical land for cinephiles, the resort is also a foodie heaven with a total of 80 restaurants and food stalls serving all kinds of food that one can name from different movies.

While food stalls provide belly-rumbling guests with instant and yummy foods, gourmet food chasers can feast on over 110 kinds of eastern and western cuisines in the restaurants while immersed in different movie worlds.

Some creative food and a variety of eateries with their own signature offerings have been trending even before the trial run, including Three Broomsticks' butterbeer and Minions-shaped ice cream bar. Some customers, however, have complained about high prices at some restaurants in the resort.

Fumio Kishida, the new leader of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), was formally elected as the country's 100th prime minister in a parliamentary session on Monday. Kishida won the race to lead the party on September 29, replacing Yoshihide Suga, who decided to step down after just one year in office.

The Japanese Diet convened an extraordinary session in the afternoon to choose the new prime minister. As the ruling coalition led by the LDP controls both chambers, 64-year-old Kishida received 311 of 458 votes in the House of Representatives and 141 of 241 votes in the House of Councillors.



""This is the real starting point. I will go forth with a strong sense of determination, with a strong resolution,"" he said at the LDP's headquarters in Tokyo in the morning.



Kishida's first major test as prime minister will be the general election. He is planning to hold the election on October 31, while campaigning for members of the House of Representatives is set to begin on October 19.

What does the election of Kishida mean for China-Japan relations?

Shortly after the parliamentary vote, Kishida's new cabinet was announced, with more than a dozen fresh faces but holdovers from the Suga government largely populating the most important portfolios.



Both Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi and Defense Minister Nobuo Kishi will retain their jobs. Motegi is a Harvard-educated political veteran who has taken the lead in negotiating key trade deals, while Kishi is the brother of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.



The finance portfolio will go to Shunichi Suzuki, who is replacing his own brother-in-law Taro Aso. Suzuki is also a veteran politician and the son of a former prime minister. He has served in government before, holding both the Olympics minister and environment minister posts.

02:46

The cabinet includes three women, among them Kishida's one-time rival for the leadership, Seiko Noda, who was named minister in charge of addressing Japan's declining birthrate. The posts of vaccine minister and digital minister also went to women, with several members of the cabinet appointed to their first ministerial post.



Kishida has also rewarded those who supported him in the leadership race, including rival Sanae Takaichi who backed him in the second-round vote against Taro Kono, and has been made LDP policy chief. Kono meanwhile has been made party communications chairman – something of a step down from his recent role heading the vaccine roll-out and past posts as defense and foreign minister.

201,Hungarian Prime Minister Orban calls on EU to adopt strategic autonomy,"Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban on Sunday said the European Union's (EU) current foreign policy lacked autonomy and called on the bloc to seize the opportunity to develop practical economic and trade cooperation with China and Russia. Orban, who is on an official Czech visit, made the remarks when asked how he views the future role of the EU as well as the role of China and Russia in global affairs.

The Hungarian prime minister said elites in Brussel are ""blinded by ideology"" and that policies toward China and Russia run counter to the EU's interests.



Orban said even though close economic cooperation with Russia and China is in the EU's interest, the bloc still closed the door to cooperation, preferring to show strength where it is weak. The ""EU is doing things that go against its own interests,"" he said.



He also said that the EU should not dance with the U.S. but should instead have an independent and autonomous foreign trade policy, adding that the EU cannot afford to lose the Eastern market.



Orban said he believes that the U.S. regards China as its biggest competitor, and Europe cannot miss the huge economic opportunities in front of it.

The conversation was the latest step in thawing relations between leaders who had long been on opposing sides in Syria's civil war, with Jordan supporting Syria's Western-backed mainstream rebels seeking to drive Assad from power.



""They discussed relations between the two brotherly countries and ways of enhancing cooperation,"" the Jordanian palace statement said.



King Abdullah told Assad his country supported the territorial integrity of its northern neighbor and efforts to preserve its ""stability and sovereignty,"" the palace statement said.



Jordan, the staunch U.S. ally has, however, in the last few months accelerated steps to normalize ties with Syria and nearly two weeks ago received the Syrian defense minister in a rare visit to coordinate cross-border security.

King Abdullah said in an interview with CNN in July that Assad was there to stay and that the status quo that kept Damascus ostracized by the international community was untenable.



The U.S. State Department said on Wednesday that Washington has no plans to ""normalize or upgrade"" diplomatic relations with Assad's government and also does not encourage others to do so.



Jordan is prodding Washington to lift parts of the 2019 Caesar Act – the toughest U.S. sanctions yet that prohibited foreign companies trading with Damascus that has hampered wider dealings with Syria, a senior official said.



Amman was waiting for a U.S. waiver that will allow its state airliner Royal Jordanian (RJ) to resume direct flights to Damascus for the first time since the outset of the conflict, the official who requested anonymity said.



Jordan last week fully reopened a border crossing with Syria to boost investment and trade that had suffered during the decade-old conflict.

203,Official: Massive California oil spill an 'environmental catastrophe',"A massive oil spill in Southern California, the United States this weekend has contaminated the coast between Huntington Beach and Newport Beach, covering both the beaches and wildlife in thick crude tar.

An estimated 3,000 barrels of heavy crude leaked into the waters off Orange County starting late Friday or early Saturday, according to local officials.

""…this oil spill constitutes one of the most devastating situations that our community has dealt with in decades,"" said Huntington Beach Mayor Kim Carr, calling the spill an ""environmental catastrophe"" and a ""potential ecological disaster.""

It came from a broken pipeline connected to an offshore oil platform known as Elly, which is about eight kilometers off the coast. The platform belongs to Houston's Amplify Energy Co., one of the largest oil producers in Southern California.

The oil spill reached the shores of Huntington Beach, a popular destination about 48 kilometers south of downtown Los Angeles, late Saturday after the pipeline burst. Officials say more oil will wash ashore this week.

Photos and videos from the coastline showed pancake-sized clusters of thick black oil lining the shores. Residents were also pictured rescuing birds covered in black sludge. Orange County Supervisor Katrina Foley said Sunday morning dead birds and fish have already washed ashore.

The pipeline and operations at three off-shore platforms owned by the company were shut down Saturday night, CEO Martyn Willsher said.

He said the company is still examining how this happened and whether it was indeed a leak. Inspections are done every other year, he said, adding the facilities were built in the 1970s and 1980s and that Amplify Energy Co. has owned and maintained the pipeline for about nine years.

""We are investigating the source and potential cause of this incident. Like I said we will continue to work with unified command to ensure that this recovery effort is concluded as quickly as possible,"" he said."

The report said the decision followed a speech by the DPRK's top leader Kim Jong Un last Thursday in which he expressed the intention of restoring the cut-off inter-Korean communication lines as part of an effort to ""realize the expectations and desire of the entire Korean nation.""

""The South Korean (ROK's) authorities should make positive efforts to put the north-south ties on a right track and settle the important tasks which must be prioritized to open up the bright prospect in the future, bearing deep in mind the meaning of the restoration of communication lines,"" the report said.

Seoul later confirmed that it had restored cross-border communication with Pyongyang. ""The government evaluates that a foundation for recovering inter-Korean relations has been provided,"" the ROK's Unification Ministry said in a statement.



The ROK's government also expressed hope that the two sides would swiftly resume dialogue and begin practical discussions to improve inter-Korean relations.

Inter-Korean ties have remained cold since the summit between the DPRK and the United States ended without a deal in early 2019. The inter-Korean hotlines were briefly back in operation in late July, but the DPRK refused Seoul's regular calls again two weeks later in protest at joint military drills by the ROK and the U.S.

""We have a common mission,"" Horowitz wrote later on Twitter. ""To maintain the hope of a peace founded on the two-state solution."" The tweet included a photo of him standing with Abbas.



Meetings between Abbas and Israeli ministers and officials have been taking place over the past three months after the bilateral direct peace negotiations had been stalled since March 2014.



The U.S.-sponsored talks between the Israelis and the Palestinians stopped in 2014 following disagreements on Israeli settlement and the recognition of establishing a Palestinian state on the 1967 border.



Israel occupied the West Bank and East Jerusalem, which are claimed by the Palestinians, in the 1967 Middle East war and has controlled them ever since.



Addressing the United Nations General Assembly last month, Abbas gave Israel one year to withdraw from occupied territory, failing which he would no longer recognize the Jewish state based on pre-1967 borders.

Migrants are seen on a boat off the coast of Libya, July 18, 2021. /CFP

More than 550 people, including three children, had been rescued off Libya's coast in two separate operations, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) said on Sunday.

In one of the operations, ""around 500 people disembarked at Azzawiya Refinery Point after being rescued or intercepted at sea on wooden boat this morning,"" the UNHCR tweeted.

In the other operation, the agency added, 56 people, including three children, were rescued after the engine on their rubber boat had broken at sea.

Libya, suffering insecurity and chaos since 2011, has been a preferred point of departure for migrants who want to cross the Mediterranean Sea to European shores."
208,UK must prepare for a post-Brexit period of adjustment - Boris Johnson,"""What we would rather do is help people into better paid better skilled jobs, which is what is happening.""

""The way forward for our country is not to just pull the big lever marked 'uncontrolled immigration' and allow in huge numbers of people,"" he said in a BBC TV interview Sunday morning.

Johnson said the lack of lorry drivers was partly due to low pay and poor conditions, and that the free movement of cheap labor pre-Brexit had been the real problem.

UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has warned that there is no quick fix for the driver shortage which has helped prompt panic-buying at petrol stations, among other problems, and said that the UK must prepare for what he called, a ""period of adjustment"" after Brexit.

With the fuel crisis now in its second week there are signs that sufficient petrol deliveries are getting through in some parts of the country to end the long queues which have appeared whenever a tanker arrives to refill the pumps. The Petrol Retailers Association says that in Wales, Scotland and the north of England the situation was starting to return to normal.

But in the most populous parts of Britain - London and the southeast - the situation is getting worse. The association's latest figures show that 22 percent of petrol stations in this part of the country have no fuel at all, compared with 16 percent two days ago.

""If you find fuel without visiting six or seven garages then you are very lucky,"" was how one London motorist described it.

Starting on Monday, around 100 military personnel will be driving petrol tankers in a bid to ease the shortage of lorry drivers.

Driver training courses have also been ramped up, though it will take time to take effect. The government will now offer longer six-month visas to attract foreign drivers but warns that increased immigration is just a short-term solution.

Farmers, though, complain that even with higher wages they can't attract enough local people for what is generally unskilled physical labor. This, along with the driver problems, has seen some empty shelves in supermarkets.

Health service and business leaders also complain that the labor shortages are affecting managers and professionals while the business organization, the Institute of Directors, says many sectors are having trouble attracting enough managers and professionals.

But it has been the panic buying at petrol stations that has focused minds on the problems, providing a political headache for the ruling Conservative Party as it meets for its annual party conference."
209,Russia test-fires Zircon hypersonic missile from nuclear submarine,"Russia's Defense Ministry said on Monday that the country's navy has successfully test-fired a Zircon hypersonic missile from a nuclear submarine at a conditional target for the first time.

Dubbed by Russian President Vladimir Putin as an ""invincible"" weapon, the missile is part of a new generation of unrivaled arms systems.

The defense ministry, which tested firing the Zircon missile from a warship in July, said that the Severodvinsk submarine had fired the missile while deployed in the Barents Sea and had hit its chosen target.

""The test launch of the Zircon missile from a nuclear submarine was considered successful,"" the defense ministry said in a statement.

Low-quality video footage released by the ministry showed the missile shooting upwards from a submarine, its glare lighting up the night sky and illuminating the water's surface.

Moscow has in recent years touted the development of weapons that it hopes will give it the edge in any arms race with the United States at a time of growing tensions with the West.

Hypersonics can travel more than five times the speed of sound and maneuver in mid-flight, making them much harder to track and intercept than traditional projectiles.

211,COVID-19 Live Updates: Global cases surpass 234 million,"Pharmaceutical company Merck said Friday that its experimental COVID-19 pill reduced hospitalizations and deaths by half in people recently infected with the coronavirus and that it would soon ask health officials in the U.S. and around the world to authorize its use.

If cleared by regulators, it would be the first pill shown to treat COVID-19, adding a whole new, easy-to-use weapon to an arsenal that already includes the vaccine.

The company said it will soon seek approval from health officials in the U.S. and around the world to authorize the pill's use. A decision from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration could come within weeks. And the drug, if it gets the OK, could be distributed quickly soon afterward.

All other COVID-19 treatments now authorized in the U.S. require an IV or injection. A pill taken at home, by contrast, would ease pressure on hospitals and could also help curb outbreaks in poorer and more remote corners of the world that don't have access to the more expensive infusion therapies.

""This would allow us to treat many more people much more quickly and, we trust, much less expensively,"" said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University, who was not involved in the research.

Merck and its partner Ridgeback Biotherapeutics said early results showed patients who received the drug, molnupiravir, within five days of COVID-19 symptoms had about half the rate of hospitalization and death as those who received a dummy pill.

The study tracked 775 adults with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 who were considered high risk for severe disease because of health problems such as obesity, diabetes or heart disease. The results have not been reviewed by outside experts, the usual procedure for vetting new medical research.

Among patients taking molnupiravir, 7.3 percent were either hospitalized or died at the end of 30 days, compared with 14.1 percent of those getting the dummy pill. After that time period, there were no deaths among those who received the drug, compared with eight in the placebo group, according to Merck.

The results were so strong that an independent group of medical experts monitoring the trial recommended stopping it early.

Company executives said they plan to submit the data to the FDA in the coming days.

Vaccines still important

Even with the news of a potentially effective new treatment, experts stressed the importance of vaccines for controlling the pandemic, given that they help prevent transmission and also reduce the severity of illness in those who do get infected.

White House coronavirus coordinator Jeff Zients said that vaccination will remain the government's main strategy for controlling the pandemic. ""We want to prevent infections, not just wait to treat them when they happen,"" he said.

Dr Anthony Fauci, the government's foremost authority on infectious diseases, called the results from Merck ""very good news.""

Merck only studied its drug in people who were not vaccinated. But FDA regulators may consider authorizing it for broader use in vaccinated patients who get breakthrough COVID-19 symptoms.

Andrew Pekosz of Johns Hopkins University predicted vaccines and antiviral drugs would ultimately be used together to protect against the worst effects of COVID-19.

""These shouldn't be seen as replacements for vaccination – the two should be seen as two strategies that can be used together to significantly reduce severe disease,"" said Pekosz, a virology specialist.

Patients take four pills of molnupiravir twice a day for five days. Side effects were reported by both groups in the Merck trial, but they were slightly more common among those who received a dummy pill. The company did not specify the problems.

Earlier study results showed the drug did not benefit patients who were already hospitalized with severe disease. That's not surprising, given that antiviral drugs are most effective when used before the virus ramps up in the body.

The U.S. has approved one antiviral drug, remdesivir, for COVID-19, and allowed emergency use of three antibody therapies that help the immune system fight the virus. But all the drugs are expensive and have to be given by IV or injection at hospitals or clinics, and supplies have been stretched by the latest surge of the Delta variant.

The antibody drugs have been shown to reduce hospitalization and death by roughly 70 percent when given to high-risk patients, roughly 20 percentage points more than Merck's pill. But experts cautioned against comparing results from the two, given the preliminary nature of Merck's data.

Health experts, including Fauci, have long called for a convenient pill that patients could take when COVID-19 symptoms first appear, much the way Tamiflu is given to help speed recovery from the flu.

Like other antivirals, Merck's pill works by interfering with the virus's ability to copy its genetic code and reproduce itself.

The U.S. government has committed to purchasing enough pills to treat 1.7 million people, assuming the FDA authorizes the drug. Merck said it can produce pills for 10 million patients by the end of the year and has contracts with governments worldwide. The company has not announced prices.

Several other companies, including Pfizer and Roche, are studying similar drugs and could report results in the coming weeks and months.

Merck had planned to enroll more than 1,500 patients in its late-stage trial before the independent board stopped it early. The results reported Friday included patients across Latin America, Europe and Africa. Executives estimated 10 percent of patients studied were from the U.S."

213,A rules-based world order: Unmasking American hypocrisy,"Editor's note: Bobby M. Tuazon is the director for policy studies of a Philippine think tank, Center for People Empowerment in Governance (CenPEG), and a professor at the University of the Philippines. He is also an editor and co-author of 15 books. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily those of CGTN.

U.S. President Joe Biden's commitment to a peaceful and more secure global community under American leadership is a hollow rhetoric and packs more dangers. In his interim national security strategy issued last March, Biden assures the U.S. will steer clear of wars but will keep using sanctions to rein in China, Russia, and other ""rogue regimes"" to comply with a rules-based world order. Further sanctions will be used to compel China to respect human rights in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, Xizang (known as Tibet) Autonomous Region and Hong Kong Special Autonomous Region, the strategy revealed.

Setting the tone to define his national security strategy, Biden's sanctions tool will in fact create more instability and bring the world closer to a ""new cold war"" as many countries have sounded out.

Sanctions have been in the arsenal of U.S. foreign policy alongside war interventionism at great cost to human lives and economies of many countries. As a result, many countries are calling on the sole superpower to renounce this weapon even as the U.S. faces investigations at the International Criminal Court (ICC) and the UN for war crimes and crimes against humanity. But the U.S. remains nonchalant.

For the 29th consecutive year, the UN General Assembly last June voted 184-2 for ending the U.S.' 60-year embargo on Cuba. Only two – the U.S. and Israel – voted against the resolution with three abstentions. The delegation of Indonesia, ASEAN's leading member, said the blockade violated international law and the sovereign equality of states and hinders Cuba's recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.

For decades, the U.S. is the only country that has used indiscriminately economic sanctions including embargoes and tariffs on states that threaten American unilateralism, its self-proclaimed democratic model, and economic supremacy. In recent years, it has also resorted to lawfare to blunt competition from other countries in the guise of protecting the world economic order.

In the case of Cuba, for instance, the U.S. supported the 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion by Fulgencio Batista followers while imposing an economic embargo the year before to preempt the island country south of Florida from becoming a socialist state. Cuban socialism was beginning to inspire other countries in South America, threatening America's proverbial sphere of influence.

In the 20th century, the U.S. has figured in at least 70 wars of aggression in as many countries. The wars of aggression combined the use of economic sanctions including against countries that may not necessarily qualify in America's list of enemies.

Arguably the country most brutally affected by U.S. economic sanctions since the 1950s is the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), with new trade and financial embargoes imposed in 2006 by George W. Bush, who named the DPRK in his ""axis of evil."" Tagged by Donald Trump's former national security adviser John Bolton as ""beyond the axis of evil,"" Syria continues to be subjected to strong trade restrictions."
214,Meng Wanzhou's freedom inspires an overhaul of U.S. state capitalism,"Editor's note: Huang Yongfu is an economic affairs commentator. After earning a PhD, he started his career at the University of Cambridge and then moved on to the UN system. He is the author of many papers and books related to economics. His current interests lie in global development and Sino-U.S. links, especially trade, financial and technological issues. He can be reached via yfhcambridge@hotmail.com. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

The release of Huawei's Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou came as a surprise, which removed one source of tension between Beijing and the West. However, the company may continue to face charges, as U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo indicated on September 24 that the Joe Biden administration would continue efforts to block Huawei from getting advanced chips if necessary.

Global opinions should be shaped in ways that stymie America's capricious, assertive and extremely destructive behaviors as a single superpower unconstrained by rules.

Meng's hostage-taking incident was part of the U.S.'s sanctions on Huawei, making a mockery of Western liberalism and free-market competition. Under an ""industrial policy"" for designated industries deemed strategically important, America's state capitalism embraces statist oversight and intervention to attack ""foreign adversaries"" through sanctions or boost industries through increased subsidies or funding.

By declaring a ""national security risk"" or ""human rights abuses,"" America has been aggressively deploying a wholesale weaponization of economic tools aimed at slowing China's technological advancement on a systemic level. Moves have been afoot to wall off sensitive technologies against China behind tariff barriers, import and export controls, subsidies and tougher investment-screening rules, to which the U.S.-China trade war had already led.

As China's biggest high-tech company and among the largest manufacturers of telecoms equipment globally making superior and cost-effective products, Huawei holds a dominant role in 5G technologies with many crucial patents on superfast 5G mobile networks. Huawei represents a technological challenge to U.S. hard power essential for achieving superiority in the military realm. America has unleashed a barrage of actions to cripple Huawei, on the grounds that its smart-phones and networking gear could be Trojan horses for Chinese spies that threaten Western interests.

On import controls, the U.S. Commerce Department put forward policies to prevent imports of any new technology deemed linked to a ""foreign adversary,"" covering chips and data services. The U.S. also urged its allies to stop using equipment in their 5G networks from Huawei 5G standards and technologies that make up part of China's Belt and Road Initiative. The most recent case is the U.S. on July 9, 2021, blacklisting a series of Chinese technology companies from which imports are limited under the premise of human rights abuses in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region."

There can be little doubt that President Joe Biden is in the midst of his greatest challenge yet as president. On September 30, Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was forced to delay the vote on the administration's flagship $1 trillion infrastructure bill.

Underlying the political significance of this initiative to his administration, Biden cancelled a scheduled trip to Chicago to join the whipping operation to secure Democratic backing for the bill and effort which ultimately failed. This was then followed by a surprise visit by the president to Congress in a bid to break the deadlock.

The $1 trillion infrastructure bill does have bipartisan support; however, it is inextricably linked to a much larger $3.5 trillion welfare and climate package which is widely opposed by Republican rivals and conservative Democratic centrists.

Consequently, left-wing Democrats are withholding their support for the $1 trillion bill unless guarantees are made to secure the wider $3.5 trillion package.

The delay of the vote reveals two problems the Biden administration faces. First, the Democrats hold a wafer-thin majority in Congress and a majority of one in the Senate in the form of Vice President Kamala Harris' tie-breaking vote. This gives disproportionate influence to individuals, such as Senator Joe Manchin or Kyrsten Sinema on the right of the party, to effectively block the legislative agenda. This obstacle necessitates the support of left-leaning Republicans and in turn, a concession to their demands. A personal mandate in the form of strong personal approval ratings is an effective foil to the impasse, but an unpopular president and a divided house create a ""lame duck"" presidency."

Blinken to address 'crisis of trust' with French FM

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken will travel to Paris on Monday and hold talks with French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian on Tuesday, the State Department has announced.

Blinken's three-day trip comes as part of efforts by President Joe Biden's administration to repair relations after a rift emerged between the allies over the AUKUS deal, under which Australia would build at least eight nuclear-powered submarines with U.S. and British technology, cancelling a previous multi-billion dollar deal for French-designed submarines.

Le Drian said last week that the nuclear submarine deal cancellation caused a ""crisis of trust"" between allies and required an explanation.

Diplomatic relations between Washington and Paris hit a low point last month following the announcement of the pact. In retaliation, France briefly withdrew its ambassador to the U.S., although the ambassador has since returned to Washington, D.C.

217,"Meet Fumio Kishida, Japan's next prime minister","Fumio Kishida became Japan's 100th prime minister by an extraordinary session of the Diet at the imperial palace on Monday, and will be formally appointed by Emperor Naruhito. The 64-year-old former foreign minister won a highly competitive race for the Liberal Democratic Party's (LDP) leadership last Wednesday, defeating Taro Kono, the minister for administrative affairs in a runoff vote. Kishida's predecessor, Yoshihide Suga, announced his resignation last month after just one year in office. Kishida reportedly plans to retain current Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi and Defense Minister Nobuo Kishi. He is expected to dissolve the lower house of parliament on October 14, and is set to call elections for October 31.

Kishida was born into a political family in Shibuya Ward of Tokyo – both his father and grandfather were legislators in the lower house. Having spent his childhood in Hiroshima, he moved with his family to New York at the age of six when his father was appointed as a trade official to the U.S. He spent three years in primary school there. After graduating from the School of Law of Waseda University in 1982, Kishida started a career in banking before entering politics as a Representative for Hiroshima's first district. In 2007, he was appointed minister of state for Okinawa affairs and the Northern Territories (the islands in dispute between Japan and Russia, known as Kuril Islands in Russia) firstly in the Shinzo Abe cabinet and later in the Yasuo Fukuda cabinet. While working as foreign minister under Abe, Kishida gained a positive reputation for his balanced views on foreign policy. In 2014, he traveled to Beijing to attend the APEC Ministerial Meeting, right after China and Japan reached a four-point consensus to improve bilateral ties. At the Seventh Trilateral Foreign Ministers' Meeting among Japan, China and South Korea in 2015, Kishida shared views with his counterparts to further cooperate in areas of environmental protection, disaster management and cultural exchange.

Kishida has been seen as a dovish policymaker, coming from Kochikai, a faction of LDP with a pro-China tradition. However, his recent steps have been influenced by various political forces within the LDP, as well as public opinion. ""The hawkish attitude towards China he has displayed during the campaign is in contrast to his political ideals of being mild and moderate, as he needs to win the support from party members,"" said Li Tingjiang, director of the Research Center for Japanese Studies at Tsinghua University. ""Whether he is able to carry out his political ideas during his tenure depends on time."" Li, also the professor from the Law School at Chuo University, added that Kishida's approach to East Asian relations will likely remain unchanged, at least before the general election expected at the end of October. But in such realms as the economy and technology, Kishida affirmed that China and Japan need to maintain cooperation as the two countries share common interests. He is likely to follow the track of Japan's dual-track diplomacy by strengthening the U.S.–Japan alliance while supporting ASEAN's multilateral mechanisms. ""The development of Japan-U.S. relations also depends on changes in China-U.S. relations,"" said professor Li. As a long-time supporter of a strong alliance with Washington, Kishida is likely to keep Japan's close ties with the U.S. unchanged. Kishida comes from Hiroshima, a city annihilated by atomic weapons in 1945. During his political life, he has advocated for nuclear disarmament. In 2014, he proposed specific measures to reduce nuclear risks including increasing the transparency of information in countries with nuclear weapons. He also helped coordinate a historic 2016 visit by then U.S. President Barack Obama to Hiroshima. As foreign minister, he reached an agreement with South Korea over the long-standing issue of Korean ""comfort women,"" saying his government would fund one billion yen ($8.3 million) to help those who suffered sexual abuse by Japan's military during World War II.

Kishida has set Japan's economic recovery as a priority. During the campaign, he called for building a stronger middle-class and narrowing the income gap with a plan that differentiates from ""Abenomics"" – an economic policy package driven by Abe to realize sustainable growth. Despite profit increases in the corporate sector, the country has experienced sluggish consumption and prolonged stagnation. The incoming prime minister has pledged to start a “positive cycle of growth” and to raise people's income, not just to benefit big corporations. Earlier this month, he promised a stimulus package worth tens of trillions of yen, including financial aid to individuals and businesses hit by the COVID-19 pandemic. He also plans to distribute housing and educational subsidies to boost consumption.

What does he like? Kishida has developed the image of a man who keeps to a simple life and stays humble. During his years working as minister of state for Okinawa affairs and the Northern Territories, he frequented a ramen restaurant near his office and always sat at a small table even after he rose to a higher post and was accompanied by more aides. Instead of ordering ramen with lots of toppings, he would order a simple dish costing about 200 yen ($1.80). Yet he does not enjoy widespread public popularity and has been said to lack charisma, despite being backed by the party's veteran politicians. After losing to Suga last year, Kishida has been trying to change his serious and bland image by connecting more to the public, including by letting people know more about his personal life through social media. ""I have three sons. Yesterday my third son turned 20 (the legal drinking age in Japan is 20). How nice for us to drink together,"" he tweeted in 2020. He reportedly likes drinking, especially strong liquor like vodka, and has a wine cabinet in his rooms for members of the House of Representatives.

As a Hiroshima native, Kishida has a special love for okonomiyaki, a pan-fried dish with wheat flour batter and cabbage originally from Hiroshima and Osaka. On the day that he won the leadership election, he published a photo of okonomiyaki on Twitter. ""My wife made me a okonomiyaki after I got home. I always eat fast foods and have talked about how I love the okonomiyaki she makes. She is a good cook. But the dish she makes today is too delicious to forget in my life, "" wrote Kishida. ""Our PM is interesting. The sauce has expired,"" one netizen commented.

Hailing from the African country of Mali, he is the first foreigner to complete a PhD in TCM in China and has studied and practiced it for more than 30 years.

Boubacar initially studied general surgery, but his love of TCM led him to change course. This was the start of his TCM journey. From reading ancient Chinese books and understanding the nature of TCM to putting theory into practice, learning TCM is not easy, and it's even more difficult for a foreigner. But Boubacar didn't give up and put what he learned into practice. His early patients didn't believe in his medical skills, but were later attracted by his fame, as he was accepted by more and more patients."

223,Research reveals mysterious treasure trove in Tibet's Namtso Lake area,"01:23

A scientific research expedition has uncovered a mysterious treasure trove from an early nomadic culture in Namtso Lake area on the northern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. Located in the southeast of northern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau and between the counties of Damxung and Bangor, Tibet Autonomous Region, Namtso has an altitude of 4,730 meters and an area of 2,020 square kilometers. Meaning ""the lake of heaven"" in Tibetan, Namtso is not only a famous world-class tourist destination, but also an important area for the second Qinghai-Tibet scientific expedition which started in the August of 2017.

Since its inception on August 5, the expedition team has conducted a comprehensive and systematic survey of cave rock paintings and rock carvings in the wilderness of northern Tibet in Namtso and its surrounding areas. Substantial evidence has revealed the rich historical implications of exchanges between nomads of the plateau and other ethnic groups. ""This time we have newly discovered that the styles of many rock paintings not only contain early Tibetans', but also early Hans', and we have also discovered inscriptions of Chinese characters. In addition, there are also Central Asians' style, indicating that Namtso Lake is an important passage of the ancient Silk Road and integrates different cultures,"" said Professor Tang Huisheng of the Department of Archaeology in School of History and Culture, Hebei Normal University, and Director of the International Center of Rock Art Dating. Experts have also discovered many ancient remains of stone tools, stone tombs, and sacrificial sites in northern Tibet, which is of great significance for understanding the early nomadic culture in northern Tibet."

Twenty-five-year-old Xiao Ting hesitated before she changed her job. Last year, she considered quitting her job at a car insurance company. After interviewing at a new firm, she checked her ziweidoushu, a form of fortune-telling in Chinese culture known as ""Purple Star Astrology"" in English. It said she should not change jobs until 2021. At night, she kept tossing and turning. The interview went very well, which was beyond her expectation, she thought. But why did it go against the prediction of the astrological test? Despite the result, she took the job the next day. ""Zodiac signs cannot predict everything,"" she said, laughing. ""And it is not that accurate."" Like many Gen Zers, Xiao is interested in astrology and checks her horoscope daily. She first learned about astrology on popular Chinese social media platform Weibo during junior high school and soon became infatuated. Like Xiao Ting, Zhang Li has been job hunting since 2018. Her astrological chart showed that she should not make a career move until 2023, a piece of advice that she took to heart. She only went to one job interview in the past three years, saying the astrological prediction showed the best time to get a new job has yet to come. ""I think her belief in astrology is just an excuse. It makes her miss many opportunities,"" said Xiao, Zhang's friend. ""Maybe she just doesn't have enough motivation to try her best.""

In recent years, astrology has become more and more popular among young Chinese. According to a survey conducted by Cheetah Mobile, a Beijing-based mobile Internet company, about 82 percent of respondents partially or firmly believe in astrology. Meanwhile, astrology-themed websites and mobile apps have become major gateways for young people under the age of 25 to learn about mysticism. There has been a surge of interest in astrology in other parts of the world as well. A report by IBISWorld, a U.S.-based industry research provider, reveals that the U.S. psychic industry, which includes services such as fortune-telling and tarot card reading, witnessed a $2.2 billion boom in 2019. Roughly 60 percent of American adults have ""New Age"" beliefs, which means that they self-identify as Christians and also hold beliefs in astrology or reincarnation, and nearly 30 percent believe in astrology specifically, according to Pew Research. Young people are also more likely to refer to astrology before making big decisions. A survey conducted by OnePoll, a UK-based marketing research company, shows that 31 percent of millennials and 25 percent of Gen Zers care about their future baby's zodiac sign. Dating app Hily found that 70 percent of women say zodiac compatibility matters, like a potential partner's star sign. People's gravitation toward mysticism is especially pronounced during times of crisis and uncertainty. As the pandemic took the world by storm in 2020, google searches for ""astrology"" over the past five years reached a peak in December last year. ""Humans tend to feel very insignificant when facing natural disasters or a pandemic, so they like to turn to mysticism to try to get a hold on the future,"" said Han Xiaoyan, a psychological therapist and professor from the School of Social Development at East China Normal University. ""It gives them a sense of control that helps reduce anxiety – a form of self-soothing."" Astrological apps like Co-star and AstrologyZone provide an easy way for these young enthusiasts to experience the power of mysticism. The app is downloaded every three to four seconds in the U.S., a representative of Co-star told Time. Sensor Tower, a mobile app store that markets intelligence products, estimates the revenue of astrological apps reached nearly $40 million in 2019.

The psychological needs behind the demand Li Lu, a millennial who works as a bank clerk in Beijing, started her own online workshop in 2019 to provide astrological services. A self-taught astrologer, Li often has discussions with her father, who works in the aerospace field but has a keen interest in The I Ching, or the ""Book of Changes,"" an ancient Chinese divination text. Unlike Li, most young Chinese are unclear about the workings of the sun and moon and how their alignment may affect them. They just take astrology for relaxation. In 2020, the word ""involution"" or neijuan caught on with young people in China. Originally an anthropological term that means an increased labor input does not bring proportional output but results in diminishing marginal returns, it now has a new meaning of ""feeling stressed out in an over-competitive society."" The word ""involution"" resonated with those young people who push themselves hard in the daily rat race. For those worried they would be left behind if they take a rest, reading an astrological description offers some comfort when feeling restless. Many think that it gives them an emotional outlet and a way to self-reflect.

On the internet, information about astrology has become both entertaining and widely available. On Bilibili, one of Chinese Gen Zer's favorite video-sharing platforms, videos related to the search term ""astrological test"" once peaked at 651,000 views. The most popular videos cover topics such as ""who is your next dating partner,"" ""check your April 2021 horoscope prediction"" or ""what is the perfect job for you?"" However, it is challenging for parents to track their children's internet usage. In September, short video app Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok, set a time limit of 40 minutes for users under 14 years old. ""Parents should provide emotional support for their children, as many teenagers are not used to asking their parents for help,"" said Liu Yaqiu, a researcher with the National Academy of Social Development Strategy Institute of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. ""Emphasizing too much on whether astrological content online is good or bad is meaningless; what we should focus on is their psychological needs,"" said Han.

229,How Meng Wanzhou stepped into a perfect storm between China and U.S.,"After nearly three years of being under house arrest in Canada, Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou and her legal team reached a deal with the U.S. Justice Department on Friday which allowed her to return to China.

The moment marked the end of a lengthy legal and political saga which took place amid rising tensions between Beijing and Washington.

Shortly after the deal was reached, Meng boarded a government-chartered Air China flight headed to the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen where Huawei is based. She landed at the city's airport Saturday evening. According to Xinhua News Agency, this is the result of unremitting efforts by the Chinese government.

""Over the past three years, my life has been turned upside down. It was a disruptive time for me as a mother, a wife and a company executive. But it really was an invaluable experience in my life,"" she said. ""I will never forget all the good wishes I've received from people around the world. As the saying goes, the greater the difficulty, the greater the growth.""

Meng, 49, has not pleaded guilty to fraud charges. Under the agreement, she will not be prosecuted further in the U.S. and the extradition proceedings in Canada will be terminated, according to a statement released by William Taylor III, one of the lawyers representing Meng.

""Facts have already proven that this is a political persecution against a Chinese citizen and its aim is to suppress Chinese high-tech companies,"" said China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying on Saturday.

On December 1, 2018, Canadian authorities arrested Meng at the request of the U.S. government which accused her of wire fraud and sought her extradition. The incident took place as the Trump administration adopted an aggressive approach in dealing with China on a variety of issues including trade and technology.

Four months before Meng's arrest, the U.S. government fired the opening salvo against Chinese high-tech companies by issuing a ban on the federal government use of products by Huawei and ZTE – two leading Chinese providers of telecom equipment, citing national security concerns. The following year, Huawei was added to the U.S. Commerce Department's Entity List, which effectively banned American companies from doing business with the Chinese tech giant.

Amid the frictions between the Trump administration and Beijing, Meng's arrest at the hands of the Canadian government quickly ignited the fury of the Chinese public, many of whom took to social media to express their anger at and distrust of Canada's legal system.

Since August 18, 2021, nearly 15 million people from over 100 countries including the U.S., the UK, Australia and Canada have signed a petition launched by the Global Times newspaper along with an open letter sent to the Canadian Ambassador in China Dominic Barton, demanding Meng's immediate and unconditional release."
230,Tech Breakdown: Why China's Mars rover lost communication,"It's been more than 100 days since China's Mars rover ""Zhurong"" stepped on the Red Planet where it has traveled over 1,000 meters and sent back data and footage to help us get to know Mars better.

However, the rover has lost communication with Earth recently. What's happened?

First, let's look at how Earth-Mars communication works.

When China launched the Mars mission, an orbiter was also sent into space along with the rover. It has been orbiting the Red Planet and serving as a data relay station for communications between the rover and mission controllers on Earth.

Since September 13, operations on the two spacecraft have been suspended for about 50 days due to the impact of an astronomical phenomenon known as solar conjunction.

Solar conjunction happens about every two years. When it occurs, Mars is on the opposite side of the sun from the Earth, making the two planets temporarily invisible to each other. The sun's electromagnetic radiation can greatly affect the communication between the rover, the orbiter and ground control.

If the rover sends back signals, charged particles from the sun could interfere, causing gaps in the data sent to Earth. More severely, commands from the Earth to the rover could be damaged, causing confusion to the spacecraft and putting it in great danger.

Therefore, to make sure Zhurong can proceed with its tasks after the solar conjunction, it has been put into ""safe mode"" along with the orbiter. Both spacecraft have paused activities and autonomously carry out health assessments, self-monitoring and trouble-shooting until communication can be restored.

All the spacecraft on Mars and in Mars' orbit during solar conjunction, including NASA's rovers Curiosity and Perseverance, are affected.

Now you may ask, is there any way to maintain communication with Mars during this period? Well, a satellite might be able to solve this problem.

In China's Chang'e-4 lunar mission, a relay satellite was launched as a communication link between Earth and the probe, which landed on the moon's far side.

As for Mars missions, if a relay satellite can be deployed out of the range of the sun's radiation, it can deflect the signals around the sun to reach Mars and Earth.

The communication with Zhurong is expected to be restored in late October. We hope the rover has a good vacation and sends back more information about the Red Planet after it wakes up.

232,Meng Wanzhou back in China after 3 years of detention in Canada,"03:54

After nearly three years of detention in Canada, Huawei Technologies CFO Meng Wanzhou returned to China on Saturday. Stepping out of the charter flight arranged by the Chinese government, Meng expressed her gratitude to everyone who was concerned about her during a brief speech in front of a crowd at Shenzhen Bao'an International Airport. Meng was detained in December 2018 at Vancouver International Airport on a U.S. warrant charging her with bank fraud for allegedly misleading HSBC Holdings about Huawei's business dealings in Iran. She was ruled free to leave Canada without extradition proceedings in Canada and further prosecution in the United States after reaching a deferred prosecution agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice on Friday.

As Meng flew back home, China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said the charges against Meng were purely fabricated and her detention was ""arbitrary."" ""China's stance on the case of Meng Wanzhou is clear and consistent. Facts have already proven that this is a political persecution against a Chinese citizen and its aim is to suppress Chinese high-tech companies,"" Hua said on Saturday.

02:47

""Over the past three years, my life has been turned upside down. It was a disruptive time for me as a mother, a wife, and a company executive. But it was an invaluable experience in my life,"" Meng said after leaving a courtroom in Vancouver following the U.S. Department of Justice dropping its request for her extradition. ""I will never forget all the good wishes I've received from people around the world. As the saying goes, the greater the difficulty, the greater the growth."" She also expressed gratitude to China and the Chinese people for their help and support.

Meng has not pleaded guilty, William Taylor III, one of the lawyers representing Meng, said in a statement after Meng ended three years of house arrest in Canada. ""I'm very pleased that Sabrina Meng and the U.S. Department of Justice have reached a deferred prosecution agreement and it has been approved by Judge Donnelly,"" the statement said. ""Under the terms of this agreement, Ms. Meng will not be prosecuted further in the United States, and the extradition proceedings in Canada will be terminated."" ""We fully expect the indictment will be dismissed with prejudice after 14 months. Now, she will be free to return home to be with her family.""

Huawei has issued a statement, saying, ""We look forward to Ms. Meng returning home safely and reuniting with her family as soon as possible."" The company ""will continue to defend itself against the allegations in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York.""

233,Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine antibodies 'disappear in many by 7 months',"Six months after receiving the second dose of the two-shot vaccine from Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) and BioNTech SE, many recipients no longer have vaccine-induced antibodies that can immediately neutralize worrisome variants of the coronavirus, a new study suggests.

Researchers analyzed blood samples from 46 healthy, mostly young or middle-aged adults after receipt of the two doses and again six months after the second dose. ""Our study shows vaccination with the Pfizer-BioNtech vaccine induces high levels of neutralizing antibodies against the original vaccine strain, but these levels drop by nearly 10-fold by seven months"" after the initial dose, Bali Pulendran of Stanford University and Mehul Suthar of Emory University said by email.

In roughly half of all subjects, neutralizing antibodies that can block infection against coronavirus variants such as Delta, Beta, and Mu were undetectable at six months after the second dose, their team reported on Thursday on bioRxiv ahead of peer review.

Neutralizing antibodies are not the immune system's only defense against the virus. Still, they ""are critically important in protecting against SARS-CoV-2 infection,"" said Pulendran and Suthar. ""These findings suggest that administering a booster dose at around 6 to 7 months following the initial immunization will likely enhance protection against SARS-CoV-2 and its variants."""
234,Huawei bans are a clear national security double standard,"Editor's note: Dr ir Johannes Drooghaag is an analyst and strategist for cybersecurity in the Netherlands and author of ""The Human Element in Cyber Security."" He wrote an open letter to Mr Ren Zhengfei on July 21 to show his support. In this interview, he shares the reasons behind his letter and his views on why Huawei becomes the target of many Western countries. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

CGTN: Should other countries worry about Huawei's technology in terms of national security?

Johannes Drooghaag: On the one hand, we see a lot of claims that Huawei would be a risk. And there are claims that Huawei would allow the Chinese government to spy on everybody who was connected to that. There's no technical confirmation (of that). There's no factual confirmation.

The second component of this narrative that Huawei would be a security risk is based on the fact that China has legislation which could force Chinese companies to collaborate with the government. The United States (also) has legislation which could force companies to collaborate. But the reach of its legislation goes much further than any other country.

At the moment, there is a proposal for legislation that could force companies to create a backdoor into encryption. That's how far the United States goes with their legislative powers.

When that is the reason behind our security concerns, and especially when I look at the European perspective, every country with such legislation should then be a risk. And not just the one country with which the United States happens to be in a trade war. I do not agree with those double standards.

CGTN: Why has Huawei become the target of many Western countries?

Drooghaag: That starts with the economic and the political issues and the statement by Mr Trump himself that he was going to ""obviate"" the company. Huawei is in this enormous focus because it happens to be the crown of the technology development that China has seen.

Twenty years ago, China was known for cheap manufacturing. And there were a lot of stereotypes about quality etc. Huawei moved away from that and many other Chinese companies as well. So Huawei has become an equal competitor in many fields when it comes to mobile devices, when it comes to mobile technology, cloud technology, AI.

The focus that they now have (on them) is the result of this trade war, which Mr Trump initiated. He stated that this trade war was going to be easy to win. It turned out it was not that easy because he apparently didn't reflect on how important China is for many economies, for many supply chains and for many companies.

So, by targeting Huawei and putting the focus on Huawei for all their partners in the European Union and around the world, he's trying to downsize the economic strength of Huawei, and by that, harming China. And that's the reason countries around the world now suddenly look at Huawei as a threat. What happens at the moment has nothing to do with democracy. It has nothing to do with the free market.

CGTN: In an open letter to Huawei CEO Ren Zhengfei, you say the arrest of Meng Wanzhou, his daughter and the company's CFO, has crossed a red line and geopolitical developments should not drive people apart. Why do you say that?

Drooghaag: I was born early in the sixties. So, the first 30 years of my life I've been under the Cold War and all those embargoes. And then as a global community, we celebrated when that finally came to an end. We finally started to appreciate people as they are in countries as they are. It doesn't mean that we have to agree with each other. It doesn't mean that we have to have the same political systems or the same culture. It doesn't even mean that we have to have the same ethical standards.

Now we are back in that old (Cold War) stage. It's difficult to comprehend what is happening.

And in the middle of that (while) I was reviewing my own research, I suddenly realized this is not just (about) countries. This is not just even companies. This is putting the daughter of the founder of a company in custody.

The company which was announced to be obviated as part of the economic war. And that is a personal act that is no longer about freezing a bank account or travel restrictions. That is a personal attack. It goes too far.

What we now see is that Canada is pulled into this economic and political conflict. Canada is known the world over for its friendly people and its beautiful landscapes. And it should not be that the neutral parties get involved. And it should not be that you hold the daughter of a person in custody just to get leverage in a conflict. And that's the message I wanted to bring to Mr Zhengfei with my open letter. I don't know him. I just wanted to give him my mental support.

The cargo ship docked onto Tianhe's backward facing port using the automatic fast docking process.

With the Tianzhou-3 docked and Shenzhou-12 headed back to Earth, the space station still consists of three parts: the Tianhe core module, the Tianzhou-2 and the Tianzhou-3.

Tianzhou-3 is one of the most advanced cargo spacecrafts in the world. It can carry as much as 6.9 tonnes of supplies.

This mission is part of a series of launches to build China's space station. Soon, three Chinese astronauts, or taikonauts, will board the Shenzhou-13 spacecraft and get into the space station.

237,Technology helps reveal more about Tibetan antelopes,"A Chinese expedition team members have found four new breeding areas of Tibetan antelopes, each holding 2,000 to 4,000 antelopes, in northwest China's Tibet Autonomous Region with the help of an intelligent video surveillance system.

Tibetan antelopes is a species under first-class state protection in China and mostly found in Tibet Autonomous Region, Qinghai Province and Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.

The scientists, from the Shaanxi Institute of Zoology, have been monitoring the migration of the species by using the BeiDou Navigation Satellite System and the 4G wireless transmission technology in the Qiangtang National Nature Reserve in Tibet's Xainza County since May.

After field research, they installed monitor devices in the core calving area, which extended six to seven kilometers wide and 20 kilometers long to conduct regular observation.

According to their observation, the calving area hosted more than 4,000 pregnant antelopes in June and the lambing period lasted between 15 to 20 days, said Wu Xiaomin, a researcher from the Shaanxi Provincial Institute of Zoology.

""The area where we are right now is very flat. There are snow mountains around the breeding grounds, so they are rich in water resources. For Tibetan antelopes, the main natural enemy in this area is wolves. If a wolf comes to this area to attack the Tibetan antelopes, this flat area is relatively easy for them to escape. Even if they cannot escape, there will not be too many casualties,"" he said.

The antelope population was calculated using the system's data-processing software, said Wu. The software divided the ground into grids and counted the antelopes with the help of infrared camera recognition and then sent the data to the mobile and laptop terminals for further investigation.

""We will conduct a systematic monitoring to figure out how many antelopes give births here, how long they stay here, and in which direction they will go for return,"" he said.

The scientists have found that the Tibetan antelopes living in the area have kept close contacts with local herdsmen and their livestock. Therefore, they have developed some new characteristics that are rarely seen on other Tibetan antelope population. For example, some Tibetan antelopes gave birth to their babies in front of or even in the crowd of the livestock.

And after the baby antelopes were born, the mother would keep close to them, which is a very unusual behavior for Tibetan antelopes, Wu said.

""This phenomenon is somewhat different from the calving process of Tibetan antelopes we observed in the past. In the past, we saw in other breeding area that the mothers would leave the babies after they gave birth. Probably due to the impact of their natural enemies, the antelopes were very sensitive to the surrounding environment. They would leave their newborns on the ground, and the babies' fur is a natural camouflage. In addition, the newborns can stand up and run very fast within two hours,"" he said."

239,China launches Tianzhou-3 cargo spacecraft for space station mission,"China successfully launched Tianzhou-3, a cargo spacecraft carrying supplies to the China space station on Monday.

The Long March-7 Y4 rocket carrying the cargo spacecraft blasted off at 3:10 pm Beijing Time (BJT) from the Wenchang Spacecraft Launch Site in south China's Hainan Province. The spacecraft reached the targeted orbit in about 9 minutes and 57 seconds.

Solar power panels on the spacecraft fully expanded at 3:22 pm BJT, marking the success of the launching process. It will dock with the space station later.

Tianzhou-3 is carrying food, water and other supplies, including an additional space suit, for taikonauts that will visit the space station in future.

As one of the most advanced cargo spacecrafts in the world, Tianzhou-3 can carry about 6 tonnes of goods packed in more than 200 bags.

""Just like the last time, Tianzhou-3 is fully loaded,"" said Yang Sheng, lead designer of cargo spacecrafts at China Academy of Space Technology. ""And the engine, including its fuel, can work together with the space station engine to perform tasks.""

The launch is part of the space missions that aim to piece together the space station. Previously, the ship's predecessor, Tianzhou-2, and the Shenzhou-12 spacecraft staffed with three taikonauts, were successfully launched. The taikonauts safely returned to Earth on September 17.

Tianzhou cargo ships among world's best

Tianzhou cargo ships have been delivering all kinds of supplies to China's space station, ranging from food items to spacesuits.

These ships also beat all others in terms of load to total weight ratio, Jia Dongyong, chief designer of Tianzhou-3 cargo ship machinery at the China Academy of Space Technology (CAST), told CGTN.

""One of the best ways to evaluate a carrier spaceship is the ratio of load to total weight. The more the payload, the better. Now, Tianzhou weighs 13.5 tonnes in total and can carry 6.5 tonnes of payload. That's a ratio of almost 0.48, the highest among existing carrier spaceships,"" he said.

""If Chinese scientists want to do some large-scale experiments, they can deliver the equipment by cargo spacecraft,"" he said, explaining that it opened up more possibilities for space exploration.

Tianzhou-3's payload is similar to that of Tianzhou-2, but the contents vary, he said. ""Compared with Tianzhou-2, Tianzhou-3 is carrying different things, for example fewer propellant.""

He also said that as Tianzhou-3 is providing for a three-person crew for a six-month stay, more food has been brought up this time along with a new set of spacesuit for spacewalking.

Rendezvous and docking technology 'standardized and serialized'

The rendezvous and docking process is often described as ""right on target"" and ""smooth,"" while it's also often compared to ""finding a needle in the sea.""

""China's R&D technology is now one of the best in the world,"" said Chen Changqing, deputy director of designers of cargo spaceship system at CAST.

He noted the technology used in both Tianzhou-2 and -3's docking process is ""fast, reliable and safe.""

""The first-generation docking technology had a high probability of missing the target; later its success rate improved, but the process still took a long two to three days, which was demanding for both the crew in the capsule and the personnel on the ground. The rendezvous and docking technology we use now is fast, reliable and safe,"" Chen told CGTN.

This technology allows for full automation and can repeat without a glitch. Chen said it's designed to become a standardized process.

""In designing the system and the technology, we aim for standardization. It has to stand repetition. China's space station needs frequent launches and docking. That's why we aim for a serialized and standardized process,"" Chen said.

IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva speaks during a joint news conference at the end of the Summit on the Financing of African Economies in Paris, France, May 18, 2021. /Reuters

Renowned economists have backed the International Monetary Fund's (IFM) Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva as she faces an intensifying probe by the fund's board over allegations that she manipulated data when she served as the World Bank's CEO in 2017.

In an interview with the Guardian, Nobel Prize winner Joseph Stiglitz described the investigation as a ""coup plot"" designed by conservative forces to remove her from the chair, motivated after she stepped up efforts to financially support developing world countries and ""positioned the Fund to take a global leadership role in responding to climate change.""

The IMF board, of which the United States is the biggest shareholder, will soon interview Georgieva and World Bank-commissioned investigators who had suggested she was responsible for falsifying an annual business report, Reuters reported citing sources with knowledge of the meetings.

A report produced last month by lawyers from the WilmerHale firm concludes that the former World Bank CEO applied ""undue pressure"" on her staff, which contributed to China's elevation from No.85 to No.78 in the Doing Business 2018 ranking.

The fund's top financial backers, including the U.S., have so far restrained from issuing public statements on the matter.

Georgieva, who has strongly denied the allegations, will be questioned by the IMF board on Tuesday, according to Reuters.

How the interviews go will likely determine whether she will win the shareholders' support.

A Bulgarian economist, Georgieva has been at the center of a war of words that looks increasingly unfavorable to her. Having been subject to harsh censures by GOP members of the U.S. Congress, she has defended herself before IMF staff, but only to draw more criticism. In an editorial, British weekly the Economist magazine called on the IMF boss to resign, citing her ""undermined credibility"" due to the ""scandal.""

However, former World Bank employees and economists have come to Georgieva's defense and attested to her integrity.

""The heated attack against Georgieva is not really about the alleged sanctity of World Bank data or about the quality of her management,"" Jeffery Sachs, a world-leading economist, wrote in an op-ed carried by the Financial Times.

""It is about the role of China in a Washington-based multilateral institution. Many in the U.S. Congress want Georgieva out because she is not a sworn enemy of Beijing.""

Stiglitz said he had read the Wilmerhale report and talked directly to those involved but he believes the investigation is ""a hatchet job.""

The World Bank and the IMF have long been at odds with each other over their institutional roles, he said, adding that the rivalry has been heightened recently as the IMF plans to increase lending to developing economies.

""One can add to this mix the isolationist strand of American politics – embodied by (World Bank president David) Malpass, a Trump appointee – combined with a desire to undermine President Joe Biden by creating one more problem for an administration facing so many other challenges. And then there are the normal personality conflicts,"" he said."
241,Report: Hopson plans to take 51% stake in Evergrande Property Services,"Hong Kong-based property developer Hopson Development is planning to take over 51 percent in China Evergrande Group's property management unit Evergrande Property Services Group with over HK$40 billion ($5.14 billion), financial news agency cls.cn said in an exclusive report on Monday, citing sources.

Trading in shares of the involved parties was halted at 9 a.m. on Monday, according to notices by the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong (SEHK).

The sources said the deal won special approval from the SEHK for the transfer of the controlling rights, as Evergrande Property Services Group has been listed in Hong Kong for less than a year.

The listing rules of the SEHK require that the controlling shareholder shall not dispose of the company's shares in any way within six months from the trading day, and shall not lose controlling rights of the company within another six months.

A filing by Hopson said the trading halt was ""pending the release of announcement(s) in relation to a major transaction"" related to its agreement to acquire the shares of a ""target"" company."
242,U.S. private equity firm wins auction for UK's Morrisons,"A U.S. private equity firm has won an auction for British supermarket group Morrisons, the Takeover Panel that oversees merger and acquisition deals said on Saturday.

The panel said Clayton, Dubilier & Rice (CD&R) bid 287 pence per share, beating private equity giant Fortress, which bid 286 pence, the panel announced in a short statement.

The winning bid values the company at about 7.1 billion pounds (nearly $9.5 billion), Morrisons said.

Shareholders will have the final say on whether to accept the offer on October 19.

Morrisons, based in Bradford, northern England, began business as an egg and butter merchant in 1899, expanding to become Britain's fourth-biggest supermarket by market share, after Tesco, Sainsbury's and Asda.

The company, which employs more than 110,000 staff at nearly 500 stores across Britain, has been at the center of a bidding war for several months.

The auction was held because neither CD&R- or Softbank-owned Fortress lodged a final offer on their earlier bids.

Morrisons chairman Andrew Higginson said the company's board had approved CD&R's final offer and said it represented ""excellent value for shareholders while at the same time protecting the fundamental character of Morrisons for all stakeholders.""

""CD&R have good retail experience, a strong record of developing and growing the businesses in which they invest, and they share our vision and ambition for Morrisons,"" he said in a statement.

""We remain confident that CD&R will be a responsible, thoughtful and careful owner of an important British grocery business.""

CD&R was advised by former Tesco chief executive Terry Leahy, who welcomed the board's endorsement and described Morrisons as ""an excellent business, with a strong management team, a clear strategy and good prospects.""

Joshua A. Pack, managing partner of Fortress, said, ""Morrisons is an outstanding business, and we wish the company and all those involved with it the very best for the future.

""The UK remains a very attractive investment environment from many perspectives, and we will continue to explore opportunities to help strong management teams grow their businesses and create long-term value.""

In September, Morrisons posted a $54 million first-half loss after tax, blaming the knock-on effects of a global supply chain crisis and a lorry driver shortage sparked by COVID-19 and worsened by Brexit.

That contrasted with a net profit of 70 million pounds last year when the sector had been boosted by panic buying in the early stages of the pandemic."

An Israeli citizen receives a third shot of COVID-19 vaccine as the country launches booster shots for people aged over 30, in Rishon Lezion, Israel August 24, 2021. /Reuters

Israel on Sunday piled pressure on its vaccinated citizens to get a booster shot by making only those who received their third dose of the COVID-19 vaccine eligible for a ""green pass"" allowing entry to restaurants, gyms and many other venues.

Israel was an early adopter of Pfizer/BioNTech booster shots – administering them to members of risk groups in July and by the end of August to anyone above the age of 12. Its campaign is being watched closely by other countries.

The new green pass is being issued to those who received three shots or recently recovered from COVID-19, replacing a previous system that required just two shots. It raises the bar for what the government considers full immunization.

Starting on Tuesday, store owners or event organizers will have to scan a customer's digital barcode before allowing entry. There will be some exemptions, such as museums and libraries.

About 37 percent of Israel's 9.4 million population has received a booster shot. The number of COVID-19 patients hospitalized in serious condition has been dropping in recent days, as has the number of confirmed daily cases, which fell to below 4,000 after topping 10,000 last month."
244,Virus surge hits New England despite high vaccination rates,"Despite having the highest vaccination rates in the U.S., there are constant reminders for most New England states of just how vicious the Delta variant of COVID-19 is.

According to statistics from the Associated Press, the five U.S. states with the highest percentage of a fully vaccinated population are all in New England, with Vermont leading, followed by Connecticut, Maine, Rhode Island and Massachusetts. New Hampshire is the 10th. The full vaccination rates across the six states range from a high of 69.4 percent in Vermont to 61.5 percent in New Hampshire.

However, hospitals across the region are seeing full intensive care units and staff shortages are starting to affect care. Public officials are pleading with the unvaccinated to get the shots. Health care workers are coping with pent-up demand for other kinds of care that had been delayed by the pandemic.

""I think it's clearly frustrating for all of us,"" said Michael Pieciak, the commissioner of the Vermont Department of Financial Regulation who monitors COVID-19 statistics for the state. ""We want kids to be safe in school, we want parents not to have to worry about their child's education and health.""

Despite the relatively high vaccination rates – the U.S. as a whole is averaging 55.5 percent – there are still hundreds of thousands of people across the region who, for one reason or another, remain unvaccinated and vulnerable to infection.

Now, a Rhode Island official said he didn't think the 70 percent vaccination goal, once touted as the level that would help end the pandemic in the state, is enough.

""What we've learned with Delta and looking beyond Delta, is ... to give you that true population level protection, you need to be in excess of 90 percent,"" said Tom McCarthy, the executive director of the Rhode Island Department of Health COVID Response Unit.

Even though parts of New England are seeing record case counts, hospitalizations and deaths that rival pre-vaccine peaks, largely among the unvaccinated, the region hasn't seen the impact the Delta variant wave has wrought on other parts of the country."
245,The scientists trying to recycle the batteries in electric cars,"But the efficient recycling of the lithium-ion batteries they run on is still being sorted out, long after the cars have already hit the roads.

In the UK, transport accounts for a third of emissions. Electric vehicles are seen as key to solving that and by 2030, the European Union needs at least 30 million electric vehicles to reach climate targets.

""If we waited to get a recycling industry set up and ready to go, they wouldn't have anything to recycle anyway until cars come to an end of life,"" said Dan Reed, the head of the ReLiB team at the University of Birmingham

The ReLiB team is working to find a new method of separating and recovering materials in these batteries.

""The main issue within the battery is cobalt because it is mined in the Democratic Republic of Congo,"" Reed added.

""And there are some ethical issues about the mining and where it comes from and its processing… we've also got manganese and nickel, which are slightly more readily available but still need to be mined.""

Elsewhere, researchers are looking at a battery design that could eliminate the need for cobalt and nickel, but the ReLiB team is focused on working out the most efficient, green and cost-effective way of disassembling the variety of battery packs currently made.

One way that they are doing this is by shredding existing batteries and then separating the components, which allows them to use 90 percent of the material after the shredded components go through a chemical separation process.

Other people use a furnace to do the same, but that only recovers about 70 percent of the metals.

But according to Reed, the group will need support from governments to make these processes cost-effective."

Six-time Ballon d'Or winner Lionel Messi suffered his first defeat as a Paris Saint-Germain player on Sunday as his team's perfect start to the Ligue 1 season ended with a 2-0 loss at Rennes.

Messi smacked the crossbar with a free-kick in the first half at Roazhon Park before Gaetan Laborde volleyed Rennes ahead just before the break with his league-leading sixth goal.

Flavien Tait struck less than 20 seconds after half-time to double the lead, with Kylian Mbappe seeing a goal ruled out for offside as Rennes snapped PSG's eight-match winning run in the league this term.

""We didn't start the match well but then we played the best 25-30 minutes of the season. It's a shame we didn't score. We conceded two goals that were hard to take,"" said PSG coach Mauricio Pochettino.

PSG lost in the league for the first time since April, when they were beaten 1-0 at home by last season's eventual champions Lille.

""In general, I'm satisfied, we created a lot of chances. Rennes scored with their first and the goal had a big emotional impact,"" said Pochettino. ""I don't like to lose, there's a bit of anger. To go 2-0 down after a good period... We're disappointed not to have finished off what we had. It leaves us a bit bitter and disappointed."""

FIFA welcomed on Sunday a relaxing of quarantine regulations that will allow Premier League players to travel to represent their nations in countries on the UK's red-list for travel.

A number of South American and African stars were not released by their clubs for the September international break, as they would have had to spend 10 days quarantining in a government-mandated hotel on their return to England.

The exemption only applies for those fully vaccinated against the coronavirus, and other players will still be forced to stay in a hotel or private accommodation provided by the club on their own for 10 days. However, they will be allowed out once a day to play or train.

""FIFA welcomes the UK government's decision to allow fully vaccinated players the opportunity to represent their countries in the upcoming qualifying matches for the FIFA World Cup and return from a red-list country to bespoke quarantine conditions,"" world football's governing body said in a statement.

""We have worked closely with the UK government, Football Association and Premier League to find a reasonable solution in the interests of everyone, and we believe this is a much more desirable solution to the situation that players faced in September.""

The bespoke solution has still been criticized by clubs for the mental impact it can have on players, who face spending up to three weeks without their families.

""The players go for 10-12 days with their national teams. Then another 10 days away from their families into quarantine. That's 22 days, and two weeks later, there is another international break,"" said Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp on Friday. ""It is not okay; we just move responsibility to the players. If you are ready to do that, then ok, if not, then stay here.""

Players also risk not being able to travel if they have not been fully vaccinated.

""We acknowledge this decision does not help every player, and we remain committed to further improving the situation for upcoming windows and joining discussions to explain more about the many measures we are putting in place to reduce the risks of COVID transmission into the community as a result of player travel,"" FIFA's statement added."

Liverpool were denied a chance to go top of the English Premier League as defending campions Manchester City twice came from behind to earn a 2-2 draw at Anfield on Sunday.

The first half ended goalless despite City dominating and failing to convert their chances as they also sought to go to the summit of the table with a win.

Liverpool took the lead shortly before the hour mark after Mohamed Salah fed Sadio Mane and the Senegalese forward finished past City keeper Ederson.

City were level 10 minutes later when Phil Foden collected Gabriel Jesus' pass and sent a low, angled finish past Alisson.

Salah got his name on the scoresheet in the 76th minute with an excellent goal in which he beat four City defenders and fired home.

However, City refused to be beaten and equalized with nine minutes of normal time left with Kevin De Bruyne's shot coming off Joel Matip to beat Alisson.

A frantic end to the game saw desperate blocks from Rodri and Andy Robertson in the final minutes stop either side from grabbing a potential winner.

The draw means Liverpool also maintains their unbeaten start to the season after seven games.

Liverpool lies in second place on 15 points, one behind leaders Chelsea, while City are third a further point behind Liverpool.

257,India imposes retaliatory quarantine requirements on UK nationals,"All UK nationals arriving in India from Monday will have to take COVID-19 tests and undergo a 10-day mandatory quarantine upon arrival.

According to a foreign ministry official who spoke on condition of anonymity, all UK arrivals, regardless of their vaccination status, will have to undertake RT-PRC test within 72 hours before travel, another test on arrival in India and a third one eight days later.

The UK nationals will also have to quarantine at home or at their destination address for 10 days.

""India has decided to impose reciprocity on UK nationals arriving in India from the UK,"" the official is quoted as saying.

The move is seen as a reprisal for an advisory the UK issued which includes Indians even if they are fully vaccinated with the Indian-made AstraZeneca shots.

India mainly relies on the Covishield vaccine, developed by AstraZeneca and manufactured in India by Pune-based Serum Institute, which is not recognised by the UK under new rules, despite being identical to the doses given to millions of Britons.

Last month, sources within government had warned of retaliation after Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar said he had urged for an early resolution after a meeting with his British counterpart at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.

India, the world's largest vaccine producer, said earlier this week that it will resume exports and donations of excess COVID-19 vaccines this month after a monthlong freeze due to a massive surge in local infections.

As the saying goes, ""One can go without eating meat for three days, but can't live one day without naan."" Naan, a traditional staple food, shares a long history with people of all ethnicities in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. Xinjiang naan is made of fermented dough. It is baked in a clay oven. The golden crispy crust is naan's distinctive feature. The round-shaped naan has always been a symbol of happiness and fortune. When eating Tawa Kawap, people split the naan and share with each other as sharing blessings.

Roasted Stuffed Bun. / CGTN Roasted Stuffed Bun. / CGTN

Unlike most places in China, people living in Xinjiang prefer to roast and not steam stuffed buns. This type of bun looks like a small, golden, square-shaped pillow, and is infused with the rich scent of mutton. Roasted stuffed buns are a part of the traditional nomadic lifestyle. The herdsman of Xinjiang graze cattle and sheep all throughout the year, and they only take simple tools and ingredients with them, such as a knife and flour. During lunch time, herdsmen would chop up mutton and onion for making buns, and then cook them over a fire. After settling down in cities, they started using clay ovens in order to prevent their food from carbon.

Hand-Grasped Mutton. /CGTN Hand-Grasped Mutton. /CGTN

Boiled mutton, or hand-grasped mutton, is a traditional dish of ethnic groups living in northwestern China, such as Mongolian, Tibetan, Hui and Uygur. The Uygur cooking method is the most interesting of them all. According to an ancient recipe, an entire lamb is cut into 12 pieces and then boiled with simple spices. As a chunk of meat is too big to be held by chopsticks, hands are used when eating, and hence the name.

Tonur Kawap. /CGTN Tonur Kawap. /CGTN

As a paradise for meat lovers, Xinjiang is best known for lamb kebabs, but for locals, there is nothing like grabbing some appetizing, traditional Uygur grilled lamb, also known as Tonur Kawap. Tonur Kawap has a history of over 500 years. Chefs usually hang lamb chops with iron hooks, and position them close to the inner wall of a heated clay pit. Compared with kebabs, Tonur Kawap grilled by residual heat retains more moisture, and is thus more tender with a richer taste.

Sauté Spicy Chicken. /CGTN Sauté Spicy Chicken. /CGTN

You may know the sauté spicy chicken, also known as Xinjiang big plate chicken, as a famous dish that has spread all over the country. But this recipe was created less than 20 years ago by chef Li Shilin, whose specialty is the sauté spicy chicken. Back then, while his customers enjoyed the taste of the dish, they thought the portion was too small. This is why Li decided to fry a whole chicken one day, and presented it on a gigantic plate for his guests. After finishing the tantalizing dish, the customers heartily commended that the dish was very satisfying. Since then, orders of ""a big plate of chicken"" have been pouring in.

Uygur Lamb Pilaf. /CGTN Uygur Lamb Pilaf. /CGTN

Mindful eating is one of the most popular topics of today. But a thousand years ago, Xinjiang forefathers already had their own recipe for healthy eating – the pilaf. According to local legend, a doctor named Abu was in poor health, and medication did not help. Later on, Abu came up with a nutritional way to stew rice, which tasted and smelled good. He had a small bowl once in the morning and once in the evening, and his body gradually regained nourishment. He later passed on the ""healing recipe"" to villagers, and that eventually became the Lamb Pilaf, one of the most common dishes in Xinjiang.

Xinjiang Hand-pulled Noodles. /CGTN Xinjiang Hand-pulled Noodles. /CGTN

When the art of hand-pulled noodles was introduced from other parts of northwest China into Xinjiang, the locals combined it with their meat-based diet. Later the hybrid Xinjiang hand-pulled noodles dish was created. Homemade noodles have been a common staple food in northwest China for generations. As the residents of the Hexi Corridor gradually migrated up north, noodles were then introduced to Xinjiang. Local residents stir fry mutton with vegetables, and then mix it with boiled noodles. Nowadays, Xinjiang hand-pulled noodles, also known as Latiaozi, have become a part of local daily cuisine.

Xinjiang Fried Rice Noodles. /CGTN Xinjiang Fried Rice Noodles. /CGTN

For the young generation of Xinjiang, the answer to ""What should I eat today?"" and ""Let's grab something to eat"" is always that popular dish, Xinjiang Fried Rice Noodles. Xinjiang Fried Rice Noodles came from southern China, and then introduced to Xinjiang in 1982. After the recipe was modified by locals, half noodles and half spicy sauce became a unique feature of this dish. Therefore, anyone who has eaten it should not forget the fiery taste. There is a familiar story. A chief from Xinjiang traveled to southwestern Chengdu, a city known for its spicy food, to sell fried rice noodles. However, his business soon fell apart because of the local overly spicy noodles.

Rose Willow Grilled Fish. /CGTN Rose Willow Grilled Fish. /CGTN

Tarim River is the mother river of southern Xinjiang. As the river flows through the desert, it not only waters millions of wild poplar forests, but also provides resources for people living by the sides of the river. For example, fish from the river is deeply loved by the local people. Rose Willow Grilled Fish is the most primitive food along the river. Villagers wash the fish they catch, break off branches of rose willow by the riverside, and then use them to open up the fish.

Xinjiang Nut Cake, also known as Qiegao, is a ubiquitous snack in the wide streets and narrow lanes of Xinjiang. The Nut Cake has a long history. When trade along the Silk Road reached its height, Xinjiang was an important transportation center with food supplies. Nuts were rich in nutrients and easy to preserve. Therefore, Xinjiang Nut Cake became a basic necessity for travelling salesmen."

In the previous episode of the “Ambassador’s China Story” launched by CGTN Global Stringer, 81-year-old South Korean former ambassador Kwon Byong-hyon took us back to his remarkable experiences in China. In the second episode, the legendary account of a 76-year-old former Spanish ambassador awaits us...

CGTN Photo CGTN Photo

“My diplomatic career began when I was 38. That’s quite an exception as most start when they are around 50. I have been the ambassador to China three times, which is extremely rare in Spain’s or even the world’s diplomatic history. My friend always jokingly says that this was history in the making. ” Eugenio Bregolat, Spain’s former ambassador

Drinking Longjing Tea (i.e. Dragon Well tea, a variety of green tea from Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, China), listening to The Butterfly Lovers (a Chinese legend of the tragic love between Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai), reading the collection of poems by Li Bai (a Chinese Tang-Dynasty poet) and studying Deng Xiaoping Theory… Obviously, this Spanish elder has perfectly integrated into Chinese society. But the beginning of his story dates back to the 1980s. Before he took up his first diplomatic tenure in China, Bregolat spent a month traveling this country. “I remember in that tour group, there were mostly Americans. And there were few foreigners in China,” he recalled. They crossed the Yangtze River and visited cities like Xi’an and Shanghai. The vast expanse of the landscape, the changing topography, as well as the colorful culture greatly impressed Bregolat. But it was the people that warmed his heart. “Once, I was on the Nanshan scenic spot of Chongqing, I saw a group of Chinese dancing. And one of them invited me to dance with them. Such a scene is still alive in my memory. From then on, I fell in love with China.” Before long, Eugenio took up the position as the ambassador to China in 1986. He later returned for two more tenures, which allowed him to witness the biggest change in this country. He wrote down everything he observed in his notebook.

Eugenio Bregolat (L) and Li Xiannian (R); Bregolat was the ambassador to China from 1986-1991, 1999-2003 and 2011-2013. Eugenio Bregolat (L) and Li Xiannian (R); Bregolat was the ambassador to China from 1986-1991, 1999-2003 and 2011-2013.

“I always said that when I was in China, I could even feel the biggest change from the place I lived.” “During my first tenure, cars were rarely seen. Instead, bicycles, carriages and donkeys were very common.”

“But ten years later, when I came back to China, I could see a 30-floor building when I walked out of the embassy and crossed Liangmaqiao. In the evening, neon lights, traveling cars, skyscrapers and cabs were everywhere (only the high-class hotels had cabs before). And restaurants were dotted on the street lines. Modernity was very much in the air. After another ten years, all the narrow streets turned to city malls. How fast that change was. Unbelievable!”

How does a visually impaired person take photography?

Visually impaired since birth, Brazilian Teco Barbero fell in love with photography when he was in journalism school. It was then that he developed a technique that allowed him to handle a camera and take photographs, even though he only has five percent of his vision. As a journalist and photographer, Barbero currently lives in the city of Sorocaba, in the interior of Brazil.

In this video, we will see how he actually takes photos with his 'eye'. He first walks to the character that he is going to photograph, to find his or her face, and then he places his thumb on the camera. By doing this, he assures the person's face will be properly framed, after that he takes two steps back and presses the shutter.

Barbero says he doesn't care if he can properly see those pictures, he cares more about what others see. The photos are his expressions of what he sees. For him, his camera is his new horizon and it can extend around the world."

302,COVID-19: Getting children vaccinated,"These are busy times in hospital pediatric wards across the U.S., at places like Children's Hospital Colorado where the Delta variant of COVID-19 has made its presence felt.

""The last couple months the rate of hospitalizations in kids has increased about four to five fold.""

Pediatrician Dr. Juri Boguniewicz says while most children don't experience severe cases, doctors are treating acute respiratory symptoms and the multisystem inflammatory syndrome MIS-C. Nationally, more than 226,000 cases of COVID-19 involving children were reported last week, a number that's been on the rise since early summer.

""Anyone could walk in a children's hospital today and see the dramatic impact that COVID and the Delta variant have made on children and adolescents.""

""No age group has been spared.""

""This surge in cases comes as students head back to school. Delta's ability to spread relatively easily makes it a risk to kids of all ages, particularly older ones who've opted not to get protection.

""Almost exclusively, teenagers who are hospitalized today are those who are unvaccinated, who have not taken advantage of the vaccine.""



""A lot of the infections, particularly in the adolescents, are preventable.""

Boguniewicz says when it comes to bringing case numbers down, it's all pretty straightforward.

""The more that we can vaccinate the entire community the better chances are that we’ll end transmission and prevent transmission to those vulnerable patients including young children.""

Kids ages 5-11 may soon be able to receive those shots. Pfizer has announced that results from its pediatric trial indicate its vaccine is safe and effective in that age group.

A Colorado nine-year-old took part in the study hoping to help conquer the disease.

""So when I heard that I could help that come along quicker I really wanted to be a part of it.""

""Coronavirus can affect us and in some cases it can kill kids.""

Children’s hospitals like this one are also contending with RSV, a seasonal respiratory virus that can be dangerous in kids. Some elective surgeries may have to be postponed. Several hundred facilities, worried about shortfalls in beds and expert staff, have asked the federal government for help as they try to get their arms around this latest, troubling trend."
303,Southern Mexicans get vaccinated,"Getting vaccines to remote populations has been a challenge for governments around the world.

In Mexico, authorities' answer has been to choose a one-shot regimen that's easy to store, namely China's CanSino jab."
304,Ivermectin overdoses,"The Rocky Mountain Poison Center gets 100,000 calls a year from people reporting that they, their family members or pets have ingested something or been exposed to or bitten by something potentially harmful.

""The concern would be like I said would be plastic, if he ingested any of the plastic.""

This year, they’ve received 19 calls from people experiencing reactions to the drug ivermectin.

""They say I read about it online and I think this will prevent COVID or I have COVID and I’m trying to treat myself so I don’t have to go to the hospital.""

Ivermectin is traditionally used to treat worms in horses and some parasitic infections in humans. But many have turned to it as an alternative to COVID-19 vaccines. Poison Center director Shireen Banerji says 11 of the 19 Colorado cases came from intentional ingestion and that symptoms can be quite serious.

""It can affect your CNS, your central nervous system, and your brain, it can cause tremors, hallucinations, even seizures.""

""I'm very concerned people are self-treating without any kind of medical guidance and that could lead to trouble.""

""It's an amazing drug for river blindness.""

David Kroll at the C.U. Anschutz School of Pharmacy says while ivermectin has done wonders for people in Africa and is being studied in relation to COVID-19, there's no science showing it could be helpful during this pandemic.

""I'm not surprised at all. It’s very easy for misinformation to spread amongst a population that already has a mistrust of experts.""

""Kroll endorses empowering patients to be partners in their own health care. He says patients have helped drive advances in areas like HIV care in the past.""

But as with the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine, he says organizations like this one, powered by social media, have led the vaccine skeptical astray.

""People are tapping into the sort of anti-pharmaceutical company mentality where of course they want you to get the vaccine because they're making billions of dollars.""

The Front Line COVID-19 Critical Care Alliance did not respond to a request for comment.

""I think the misinformation should be corrected and I think providers who are being asked by their patients for prescriptions need to really think hard, is this safe, is this effective, is this going to help my patient?""

Livestock suppliers have also seen ivermectin fly off the shelves. Large doses fit for horses have led to some human overdoses.

""It makes me worry that the resolution of the pandemic is going to be prolonged by people pursuing incompletely tested hypotheses.""

He says vaccines remain the best COVID-fighters out there. But the calls keep coming."
305,France withdraws from UK defense talks over Australia submarines row,"France's defense minister has cancelled a high-level meeting with her UK counterpart this week amid a growing diplomatic row after London signed a new security deal with the U.S. and Australia.

The so-called AUKUS deal will build nuclear-powered submarines for Australia. The move means Canberra has pulled out of an existing contract with France, which has angered officials in Paris.

Meanwhile, European Union foreign ministers will discuss the dispute on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly (UNGA) in New York on Monday.

Florence Parly, who is minister for the French armed forces, was due to meet UK Defense Secretary Ben Wallace in London for two days of talks aimed at strengthening post-Brexit military ties.

UK official Peter Ricketts, who was set to chair the meeting, told the BBC the talks were ""postponed to a later date.""

The announcement of the AUKUS deal last week has led to a strong rebuke from Paris, with President Emmanuel Macron taking the unprecedented step of recalling the country's ambassadors to Washington and Canberra.

France began doubting Australia's commitment to a $40 billion submarine order in June and Macron was only informed by Canberra of the deal's collapse in writing hours before it was announced, a French presidency official said.

The official said there had been no hint of the contract cancellation when Macron met Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison in Paris in mid-June, shortly after a meeting of G7 leaders in the UK.

James Cleverly, a minister at the UK foreign office, said the fallout was part of the ""ups and downs"" in ties between the nations.

""All bilateral relationships go through periods of tension. Ultimately, our relationship with France will endure,"" he told the BBC."

While the U.S. battles a surge in COVID-19 cases across the nation, infections are worse in some states compared to others. Wyoming, Kentucky, Tennessee, South Carolina, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, and Florida have reported the most daily infections per 100,000 people over the past seven days.

As hospitals across the U.S. struggle to treat COVID-19 patients, some states are running out of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) beds. Alabama, Georgia, Texas, Florida and Arkansas have less than 10% of beds available, according to Department of Health and Human Services data. Data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also shows hospitalization from the virus is 16 times more likely among people who are unvaccinated.

Florida Governor Ron DeSantis’s administration followed through on their threat to withhold funding from local school districts that are requiring students to wear masks, despite the ruling of a state judge. DeSantis previously issued an executive order banning mask mandates in schools but after parents sued education officials, a judge ruled in favor of the parents, saying the administration doesn’t have the authority to punish schools for the mandate. The Florida Department of Education is withholding monthly salaries from school board members in Alachua and Broward counties. The U.S. Education Department’s Office for Civil Rights is investigating five other states for having similar mask mandates, that might be restricting students who have federal protections from discrimination based on their disabilities.

Hospitals in Louisiana are doing their best to prepare for the aftermath of Hurricane Ida, amid damage from the storm and the COVID-19 pandemic. With power outages city wide, hospitals are running on generators for at least several days. Some hospitals had to evacuate patients because of storm damage and others are running low on oxygen. Officials say while cleanup and repairs could take weeks or months, they are thankful the storm wasn’t worse."

The UK has denied reports it pushed for a gate to be left open at Kabul Airport last week hours before a deadly suicide attack at the facility.

A report by Politico claims U.S. forces left the Abbey Gate open longer than they wanted to, to allow British personnel to speed up their evacuation efforts.

The gate was where a suicide bomber killed at least 170 civilians and 13 American troops last Thursday.

Special report: How conflict drives poverty

Speaking to Sky News, UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, who has faced strong criticism over his handling of the Afghanistan crisis, said it was ""just not true ... that we were pushing to leave the gate open.""

Prime Minister Boris Johnson's office put out a similar statement on Tuesday denying the reports as British officials seek to distance themselves from the claims.

UK nationals left behind

Like many Western nations involved in the 20-year Afghan war, the UK has been scrambling to evacuate thousands of its citizens and Afghan staff since mid-August.

Raab said more than 17,000 people had been taken out of Afghanistan but that some British nationals were left behind. He put the figure in the ""low hundreds,"" according to the BBC.

Many of those are understood to be larger families, or those without the correct documentation.

But there are fears about the fate of those still in the country as the U.S. withdrew its final soldiers late on Monday.

Taliban spokesman Suhail Shaheen tweeted to say Afghanistan had ""gained full independence"" following the departures.

But millions of people in the country and outside remain worried about what the future holds for a nation that has suffered more than four decades of conflict.

Many global powers are still weighing up how to deal with the Taliban, which after 20 years of war seems in a stronger position than it was before the U.S. invasion.

Johnson's spokesman said it was ""too early to dictate if and how we would work with the Taliban going forward.""

""A lot will depend on their actions from now,"" he added.

Aside from the political uncertainty, the United Nations has warned that Afghanistan is facing a humanitarian crisis and possible famine.

Although the report blames China for the uncertainty surrounding the virus, it admits Chinese officials ""did not have foreknowledge of the virus before the initial outbreak.""

China has repeatedly urged the U.S. to respect science and stop politicizing COVID-19 origins tracing and twice invited WHO experts in for the origins tracing.

While the investigation of COVID-19's origins is inconclusive, the report did state the virus was not developed as a biological weapon or was genetically engineered.

During the administration of former U.S. President Donald Trump, then Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and some other State Department officials had peddled a conspiracy theory that the virus was a potential biological weapon created in China.

Why the White House has backed down from the 'Wuhan Lab Theory'

The intelligence agencies involved in the report are divided on their theories of the virus's origins.

Some believe with low confidence that COVID-19 was likely caused by natural exposure to an animal.

Another agency assessed with moderate confidence the first human infection most likely came from a lab accident.

And other agencies wanted more information before agreeing with either theory, saying the study ""lacks clinical samples or a complete understanding of epidemiological data from the earliest COVID-19 cases.""

According to the WHO report on the global tracing of COVID-19 origins released in March, COVID-19 introduction through an intermediate host is ""likely to very likely,"" introduction through cold/food chain products is ""possible,"" and introduction through a laboratory incident is ""extremely unlikely."""

About 10 million children in Afghanistan need humanitarian assistance to survive, according to the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF).

UNICEF warns that 4.2 million of children are out of school. Some 435,000 kids are internally displaced. The UN has recorded more than 2,000 violations of children's rights since January.

A severe drought, water shortages, COVID-19, the oncoming winter and now the Taliban are all factors impacting the humanitarian needs of people in Afghanistan.

UNICEF expects the humanitarian crisis to get worse.

The organization says it will stay in Afghanistan in the days to come.

According to the World Food Programme (WFP), one-third of the country's population is facing food insecurity.

They're asking for $200 million by the end of the year, so they can keep working in Afghanistan after the Taliban's takeover.

Without this funding, WFP Executive Director David Beasley says the program will start to run out of food in September, reports Al Jazeera.

Beasley adds, the Taliban has assured the WFP can continue to provide aid to Afghanistan.

""So far they [the Taliban] have calibrated, cooperated and given us the access we need,"" he told Al Jazeera."

In recent weeks, events in Afghanistan have put the country in the spotlight once again after years of it drifting off the world's news radar. But for those of us with a personal link to the embattled nation, political instability and devastating war have sadly become all too familiar. The next time you meet an Afghan, ask them if they recall their parents talking about politics and the country's countless conflicts at family gatherings. I'll bet almost all of them do.

The story of war and migration is one that has touched all Afghans. I was born in London five years after my parents left Afghanistan. It was the Soviet invasion in 1979 that caused the first major exodus from the country in the 1980s. Few could have predicted that 42 years later, people would still be forcibly displaced as a result of violence, which the overwhelming majority has nothing to do with.

It has been almost 20 years since the U.S.-led invasion toppled the Taliban government, which ruled Afghanistan from 1996 to 2001. What transpired in the following two decades was a failed attempt at state-building, if the ease with which the government and its armed forces collapsed are anything to go by. Western officials – including U.S. President Joe Biden – have said they were surprised by how quickly the Taliban took over the country. Barely 10 days after taking its first provincial capital, it captured Kabul. But for those of us who've been closely observing events, the structural weaknesses of the Afghan government were plain to see. There are many factors that have contributed to the collapse of the state but some key dates and issues stand out.

Endemic corruption Given the nature of its tribal society and its notoriously difficult landscape, the U.S. and its international allies used a collection of warlords in the fight against the Taliban in 2001. These were men who made a name for themselves – not always positively – during the resistance against the Soviets and the ensuing civil war in the early 1990s. As the western focus shifted to setting up a political structure, many of the leaders were given senior government roles as billions of dollars of aid and military support began trickling in. The result was a culture of cronyism and endemic corruption that permeated Afghan society and was very often linked to the top. The United Nations' former deputy special envoy for Afghanistan, Peter Galbraith, told the BBC that coalition partners ""never seriously tried to address the corruption that was prevalent from the top."" He added: ""The local partner was corrupt, ineffective, illegitimate."" Under the leadership of Hamid Karzai and his successor Ashraf Ghani, Afghanistan constantly ranked among the most corrupt countries in the world. According to Transparency International's Corruption Index, it ranked 165 out of 180 nations in 2020. To put it into perspective, analysis by Brown University in April estimated the war cost the U.S. alone $2.26 trillion. Many other countries were involved in funding the conflict, aid and reconstruction efforts and pouring billions into the nation.

Crisis of governance The widespread prevalence of corruption did little to endear the government to Afghans. The country's political structure didn't help either. From the off, the system imposed was a highly centralized state, with the president inheriting significant powers with few checks and balances. On paper, they existed – such as the largely ceremonial parliament – but in practice, the president's signature was sacrosanct. Hamid Karzai was appointed interim leader in 2002 and won his first election in 2004. Five years later, he was re-elected as president amid reports of widespread electoral fraud. In 2014, former finance minister Ashraf Ghani was sworn in as his successor, in another disputed election, which was mired in allegations of vote-rigging and ballot boxes being fiddled with. In both instances, the apparent loser was Abdullah Abdullah, a sharply dressed politician who was a figure of the Northern Alliance resistance to the Soviets and the Taliban.

Both he and Ghani traded accusations of fraud, which led to months of paralysis and a failure to form a new government. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry had to fly in to mediate and the result was a so-called ""National Unity Government."" Ghani would remain president, while a new role of chief executive of Afghanistan was created for Abdullah. The result was a further fracturing of governance and a true turning point for attempts to nation-build. Regardless of its intentions, the move eroded the government's – and particularly Ghani's – legitimacy in the eyes of many Afghans. The 2019 presidential election involved the same two front-runners. The result was predictably the same – allegations of fraud, months of political crisis, two parallel governments being set up and finally, another power-sharing deal reached almost eight months later in May 2020. According to the country's Independent Election Commission, voter turnout was less than 20 percent – far lower than the approximately 60 percent recorded in 2004. Throughout the past two decades, the U.S.-backed government in Kabul has been beset by political problems. Despite the scenes in bustling cities, many Afghans had little day-to-day involvement with state institutions and few viewed the political establishment as working in their favor. That has been a constant theme in the years I have been speaking to people there.

Security weaknesses ""We spent over a trillion dollars. We trained and equipped an Afghan military force of some 300,000 strong,"" that was what Biden said about the Afghan security forces days after the Taliban's rapid offensive. In reality, the true number was much smaller. So-called ""ghost"" soldiers and police officers have been a defining characteristic of the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF). It's an example of how intertwined the fundamental problems above were. Corruption meant salaries were collected for soldiers who didn't exist and poor governance allowed it to go on. Despite the eye-watering amounts of money spent on training the ANSF, they have long suffered from structural deficiencies. Aside from being poorly equipped in places, high rates of absenteeism and drug abuse were common, as were concerns of low morale and ethnic divisions being reinforced in the army and police. The issues have been well-documented but rarely made international headlines. Throughout the conflict, there has been a fascination with the numbers trained – i.e. quantitative targets at the direct expense of qualitative progress.

338,Afghans in UK worry about nation's future after Taliban takeover,"As the world scrambles to react to the Taliban's takeover of Afghanistan, millions of Afghans outside the country are watching events closely.

One of the largest diaspora communities is in the UK, where many are worried about what comes next for a nation that has seen more than four decades of conflict.

Many Afghans still have family in their home country, including Qari Abdul Wakil.

Along with his family, he fled the Afghan Civil War in 1991 and went to Pakistan before making it to London in 1996. Today, he heads a mosque and community center in the suburb of Hounslow, one of a few areas in the UK capital with a large Afghan community.

""We don't want this war to continue any longer,"" he told me, inside the prayer room at the Islamic Integration Community Centre (IICC), which he founded in 2008.

Today, it's a hub for Afghans across the capital, where it hosts events that many still hold dear, like weekly Friday prayers and Islamic marriages and funerals.

""In my lifetime, I've witnessed 45 years of fighting in Afghanistan. Nobody is happy to leave their country. All this fighting has forced us to escape. But the love we feel for our country is in everyone's hearts. It's not like we've forgotten our nation,"" he adds.

It's not just older Afghans who are concerned about the latest developments.

24-year-old Yusuf Ibrahimi works at the IICC and has been receiving calls from worried residents seeking help in Afghanistan: ""I think all the Afghan community, especially the youth, are in a state of shock. Things have happened very quickly, very dramatically. We couldn't expect how quickly the Taliban could take over. But the first hope is that people are safe."""

Lawmakers in the UK have been debating the situation in Afghanistan, with many venting their anger at Prime Minister Boris Johnson over the speed at which the Afghan government collapsed.

Parliament was recalled early from its summer break to debate the emergency session, which went on for more than seven hours.

Former Prime Minister Theresa May said it was ""incomprehensible"" the UK did not help sustain the government in Afghanistan, given its military involvement in the country.

""Was our intelligence really so poor? Was our understanding of the Afghan government so weak? Was our knowledge of the position on the ground so inadequate or did we really believe this? Or did we just feel that we had to follow the United States and hope that, on a wing and a prayer, it would be alright on the night?"" she said.

Despite the criticism, Johnson defended the UK's role in the 20-year conflict, saying it had achieved its goals.

""The United Kingdom, among others, joined America in going into Afghanistan on a mission to extirpate al-Qaeda in that country and to do whatever we could to stabilize Afghanistan, in spite of all the difficulties and challenges we knew we would face. And we succeeded in that core mission,"" he said.

The UK, like most Western nations involved in Afghanistan, has been scrambling to get its citizens and staff out of the country.

Many lawmakers also called for more help for Afghan refugees, especially those who have helped serve with British forces and diplomatic missions.

On Tuesday, the government in Westminster announced it would be accepting 20,000 more refugees from Afghanistan over the coming years, with 5,000 in the first year of the scheme.

Afghans watch and worry

As politicians debated the withdrawal and future situation, thousands of Afghans living in the UK are watching events closely, many of them worried about family and loved ones back home.

Zemar Sakha fled Afghanistan during the Soviet invasion in the 1980s and is saddened the country is still suffering conflict several decades later.

""I was an army officer, I left Afghanistan 36 years ago. We never, ever guessed one day it will be like this. We can imagine any kind of situation but not a worse situation like now. This is something unimaginable for our people.""

Another Afghan living in London, Hussein Amiri, said he had made contact with relatives in Kabul and that ""they were currently staying indoors and that the streets of the city felt much quieter.""

For much of Afghanistan's diaspora, war has been a constant theme of their lives. The United Nations and the international community – including the UK – have raised concerns about a possible humanitarian crisis arising from the latest violence.

Once a refugee himself, Sakha hopes Western nations do not turn their backs on the Afghan people.

""They have to support us any way they can because they are part of the problem, all the West is involved in this problem, all of the West,"" he said."

368,'Pingdemic': What is it and why is it threatening the UK food supply?,"Across the UK, businesses face a staff shortage as hundreds of thousands of people are self-isolating after being contacted by an official health app telling them to do so.

That is because they have come into contact with someone testing positive for COVID-19. In the second week of July, almost 619,000 people were ""pinged"" (alerted) by the app – a record number.

The result has been the closure of some supermarkets, hospitality venues struggling to get workers and, according to the Road and Haulage Association, a shortfall of around 100,000 lorry drivers to transport critical goods.

The impact on supply chains and staff is focused in ""specific places where case numbers are particularly high,"" according to Helen Dickinson, CEO of the British Retail Consortium.

The fact that self-isolation is not required by law has added to the confusion for many businesses and individuals. Earlier this week, one government minister said people could make an ""informed decision"" on whether or not to quarantine. Later that same day, Downing Street announced it was ""crucial"" people did to avoid the spread of the virus.

George Eustice, the UK's environment secretary, reiterated that message on Friday. He told Sky News that most businesses would have to follow the rules to ""dampen the pace and velocity"" of new infections.

Exemptions for critical workers

Following mounting pressure this week, the government has now brought some exemptions for key parts of the economy.

Around 10,000 workers involved in producing and supplying food will no longer need to quarantine if pinged and, with a negative test, can go back to work.

Eustice said it was ""very obvious"" why food was a priority. Adding: ""We will never take risks with our food supply.""

It follows a partial relaxation of rules across 16 other sectors, including essential transport, medical and emergency services and the energy industry.

But, those rules will be tighter. Only those who are explicitly named in letters from the government and who are double-vaccinated will be exempt.

Other sectors will miss out though – such as hospitality, which is already facing a staff shortage due to the impact of the pandemic."

In England and Wales, a record 618,903 people were pinged by the National Health Service's COVID-19 app in the week to July 14. That's up from 520,000 the previous week, and those contacted are expected to quarantine for 10 days.

The result of the so-called ""pingdemic"" has seen staff shortages hit the hospitality, food and supermarket and haulage industries in particular.

One supermarket chain, Iceland, has closed some stores due to staff shortages, Reuters reported, while the country's second-largest chain, Sainsbury's, said supplies had been affected but it was ""working hard to ensure customers can find what they need.""

Businesses in the UK are calling for urgent clarity over the rules around self-isolating when staff come into contact with someone who has tested positive with COVID-19.

The British Retail Consortium said workers and suppliers who are double-jabbed should be exempt from the requirements, given that they have worked throughout the pandemic.

On Monday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson – who is himself self-isolating – said ""critical workers"" wouldn't need to quarantine, but has since apologized for growing confusion about the guidance.

There was set to be a list of those who would be exempt from any rules but that plan was subsequently shelved, with the government saying exemptions would be considered on a ""case-by-case basis"" instead. However, pressure has mounted on officials to do more to resolve the issue.

In another apparent U-turn, Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng, said new guidance on exemptions for ""specific sectors"" was now being worked on and will be released on Wednesday. But he said there was ""no need for panic.""

""I don't think there's any cause at all for the kind of alarmist, in some instances, panic but I am very mindful of the fact that businesses and other people are very concerned,"" he said. ""I understand that, but I think we shouldn't try and create a false sense of alarm.""

Cases rising

The pingdemic issue risks overshadowing Johnson's decision to end almost all legal coronavirus restrictions on Monday. Many health experts had warned the move could be premature, with cases rising sharply in the UK.

On Wednesday, more than 44,000 people tested positive for COVID-19. In the last seven days, the total was almost 335,000 – a rise of 36 percent on the previous week. With rules now relaxed, those figures are expected to rise further.

While the new guidance for key sectors could help minimize the disruption being reported, for others who are not exempt but have been double-jabbed, Kwarteng said current rules requiring self-isolation when pinged would remain in place until August 16."

375,UK wants new EU deal on Northern Ireland Protocol,"The UK says it urgently wants a new deal with the European Union to govern trade in Northern Ireland.

The current rules – which were agreed between the two sides last year – have led to tensions.

They include food shortages in Northern Ireland, increased checks on goods going into Northern Ireland, lengthy queues and backlogs at ports and even the re-emergence of sectarian violence on the streets.

""We cannot go on as we are,"" Brexit Minister David Frost told parliament as he announced the UK government's proposals.

""We see an opportunity to proceed differently, to find a new path to seek to agree with the EU through negotiations, a new balance in our arrangements covering Northern Ireland, to the benefit of all.""

What is the Northern Ireland Protocol?

The protocol is part of the international treaty signed between the UK and the EU last year outlining their relationship after Brexit. It is an insurance policy to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland (part of the UK) and the Republic of Ireland (part of the EU).

In order to avoid any checks on goods along the land border, the two sides agreed to initiate a trade border in the Irish Sea. That meant Northern Ireland would in effect remain in the EU's single market for goods, while England, Scotland and Wales would not.

The protocol was also designed to protect the peace process in Northern Ireland and the Good Friday Agreement, which brought an end to around three decades of sectarian conflict known as The Troubles.

The implementation of the protocol has proved onerous for businesses on both sides and has angered unionist politicians in Northern Ireland, who back closer ties with the UK.

Frost outlined key changes the UK wants to see to the protocol including keeping an open border on the island of Ireland, an extension of current grace periods to allow goods to keep moving freely across borders and, crucially, no longer having EU institutions and the European Court of Justice governing the protocol.

The latest move is unlikely to go down well with Brussels, which has insisted the deal in place must be respected.

Speaking to the BBC, Ireland's Minister for European Affairs Thomas Byrne said the protocol ""obviously has complications"" but that it cannot be redrawn.

""We're clear there can be no renegotiation of the Protocol. It's been agreed by the British government and the EU. We have to work within the confines of that agreement,"" he said.

Triggering Article 16?

Article 16 of the protocol allows either the UK or the EU to unilaterally break the terms of the deal in extreme circumstances. Frost said London would not trigger the clause even though it had the right to.

""It is clear that the circumstances exist to justify the use of Article 16. Nevertheless ... we have concluded it is not the right moment to do so,"" he said.

U.S. President Joe Biden has also previously weighed in on the issue. His administration has said the Good Friday Agreement – which one of his predecessors, Bill Clinton, helped broker – ""must be protected."""

Large parts of the travel industry have criticized the UK government's latest changes to its traffic-light system for travel. Only two destinations have been added to its green list, which requires no quarantine on arrival in the UK – Bulgaria and Hong Kong. UK travelers are currently banned from entering Hong Kong over fears they may bring in the Delta variant. In other changes, tourist hotspot the Balearic Islands – which include Ibiza, Majorca and Menorca – will move back onto the tougher amber list, which currently means 10 days of self-isolation at home on return to the UK. Four other nations – Cuba, Indonesia, Myanmar and Sierra Leone – will be classified as red.

All of the above changes come into effect from 3 a.m. GMT on Monday July 19. Virginia Messina, managing director of the World Travel and Tourism Council said the constant changes were putting people off booking trips. ""I think the challenge we have is all these changing rules, because that is what is really undermining consumer confidence. We are really at a peak season when it comes to travel, particularly in regions like Europe and the UK, so the next six weeks are really significant."" Many in the travel sector want to see more places added to the green list, particularly given that many locations have lower infection rates than the UK.

392,Testing children for the COVID-19 vaccine,"For more than six months now, people have rolled up their sleeves for the COVID-19 vaccine. More than 180 million Americans have received at least one dose, but one group has not been part of the effort: young children.



""I was really lucky to have this chance, so I really did not want to turn it down.""



Nine-year-old Daemo Gregorie-Cradick is part of the new Pfizer vaccine trial being conducted by Children’s Hospital Colorado and some 80 other medical facilities. More than two-thousand kids ages 5-11 are part of the study.



""We will get an idea of whether children who got the vaccine were protected and know their immune response.""



Dr. Eric Simoes is leading Colorado’s portion of the trial in which two-thirds of participants receive the vaccine and one-third a placebo. Based on his first shot, Daemo thinks he got the real thing.



""Kind of like in a way a shiver going down my arm, and that’s never happened before.""



Until now, children under 12, like Daemo, have not been a vaccine priority. Their rates of COVID-19 infection and risk of severe disease are lower than adults.



That's prompted some experts to urge caution, that too much remains unknown about possible vaccine risks. But the COVID-19 virus has proven fatal to a small number of kids. Simoes says it's no time to hold back.



""We can't predict which child is going to have signs and symptoms that bring the child to the hospital, therefore it behooves us to protect children.""



Especially, he says, when more virulent and contagious disease variants pose a serious threat.



""Why wait for it to happen before we try to prevent it. Don't wait for the hurricane to come before you put shutters on the windows.""



""If you become less ill from the virus then you have less chances of spreading the virus to other people, so if everybody becomes vaccinated, there's less spread going on.""



Daemo's father says kids' lack of social distancing make the vaccine even more of a priority.



""I look and see how groups of people work and play together, this group plays closer in proximity to one another than any other group. Like I don't see my colleagues and tackle them.""



This part-time fisherman says he’s always interested in learning. He was chosen by lottery for this trial and believes he hit the jackpot with this opportunity.



""Some of my friends didn’t really believe I was going to do this.""



If he got the placebo, he'll receive the actual vaccine in six months. Pfizer expects data from the study this fall and could ask regulators for emergency approval of the drug soon after.

UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson rejected concerns raised by German Chancellor Angela Merkel during a visit to Britain that big crowds at upcoming Euro 2020 football matches in London could accelerate COVID-19.

Johnson, speaking alongside Merkel at a joint news conference, said that he'd follow the ""scientific guidance"" and he did not plan to order a reduction in crowds attending matches at Wembley Stadium.

Crowd capacity at Wembley will increase to more than 60,000 fans for the semi-finals and final of Euro 2020 under a pilot scheme announced last week.

""The position is very clear in the UK, which is that we have certain events which we can put on in a very careful and controlled manner with testing of everybody who goes there,"" he added.

China is the UK's fifth-largest trading partner, with bilateral trade in goods and services worth $112 billion a year.

But a series of high-profile disagreements on key issues has raised political tensions between the governments in London and Beijing.

They include the future of Hong Kong and retaliatory sanctions over allegations of human rights abuses in Xinjiang – something China strongly denies.

""China creates opportunities for the UK rather than poses a threat,"" said Zheng.

""The sound development of China-UK relations will provide a stable and predictable macro-environment for the enterprises of our two countries.""

Over the past two decades, the economic relationship has improved significantly. Exports either way have risen almost 900 percent during that period, according to Sherard Cowper-Coles, chair of the China-Britain Business Council.

""There are now more than 800 Chinese-owned companies trading in the UK, employing some 75,000 people throughout the country. So, trade may sound like quite an abstract relationship but for me it's about real people making, buying and selling real things,"" he said.

Bilateral ties may have peaked under former Prime Minister David Cameron, who ushered in a so-called ""Golden Era"" of relations with the world's second largest economy. But several high-profile deals have since been reviewed, with the current political environment in the UK a lot more wary of Chinese investment, especially in key, sensitive areas of the economy.

Last year, telecoms firm Huawei was banned from taking part in the UK's 5G networks – a decision the company said would cost the country billions of dollars.

Zheng said the countries were now at a ""critical juncture"" and it was ""even more important that businesses keep working"" to improve ties.

Commenting on the political tensions, he added: ""It is not surprising that we have different views on certain issues, but the key is to respect core interests and major concerns."""

The quartet makes up a third of the tournament's 12 main partners this year – that's more than any other country.

Digital payments firm Alipay has signed an eight-year deal with the sport's governing body in Europe, UEFA, to become the official global payment partner for its tournaments. ""Football is a universal, global language and it can also help us bridge all kind of people around the world,"" said Aaron Wang, general manager of sports, culture and entertainment at Ant Group, which operates Alipay. ""We really think the Europe market is important but it's also about improving the spectator experience. For example, in these 11 stadiums across the continent [where games are being played] the fans in there can use Alipay."" Wang said the Hangzhou-based firm ""is open"" to similar deals in other sports, such as ""basketball, badminton and table-tennis,"" with a focus on making life easier for fans."

409,Treating COVID-19 long-haulers,"22-year-old Devin Kadis of Colorado contracted COVID-19 last August. She immediately went into quarantine and began thinking about recovery.

""I definitely was very sick. I was bedridden, I had all the symptoms pretty much besides a fever actually.""

She soon began to feel better but then…""Everything started to go downhill again.""

She started experiencing what she calls 'body crashes.'

""I couldn’t move. My friends had to pick me up physically off the ground and put me in bed, and I couldn’t even speak. I was slurring all my words.""

The loss of smell, occasional trouble breathing, and brain fog continued into the fall.

""I didn’t need the answer, I know there weren’t answers yet, but I just needed somebody to make sure that I was okay.""

Eventually she landed at UCHealth University of Colorado Hospital, one of at least 33 U.S. medical facilities that are meeting this so-called long-hauler syndrome head-on.

""I think it’s being recognized as a much bigger problem as people are starting to recover from COVID.""

Dr. Natasha Altman helps run this post-COVID clinic which employs a variety of specialists to try to get a handle on what ails patients like Kadis and help them, somehow, someway.

""Long-hauler syndrome is a bizarre, often debilitating by-product of COVID-19. It’s marked by strange, wildly different symptoms. Doctors don't know what causes it.""

""There's something that the virus is doing I think either to the autonomic nervous system or how it's impacting the heart itself or the other organs as well.""

On this day, Altman, a cardiologist, put Kadis through a treadmill stress test to determine whether heart issues were causing her exercise intolerance. Heart muscle inflammation and persistent high heart rates are two post-COVID symptoms. This syndrome affects a wide range of Americans.

The non-profit organization FAIR Health found nearly one-quarter of those who contracted COVID-19 experienced at least one new medical condition one month after infection, including a number of people who had mild or no symptoms initially.

""We have not seen this burden of persistent illness in people who are not hospitalized with this type of respiratory infection previously.""

UC Health doctors have found that recumbent exercise, lots of fluids and time are three things that tend to help their patients.

""I would definitely say one size doesn't fit all.""

""I would never want this to happen to anyone else, because it's been tough.""

Kadis, who despite the reluctance of some in the medical community to take long-hauler syndrome seriously, has been reassured it's not in her head, it's a real thing.

""The fact that I can work out again, the fact that I can smell again, means that I will be back to normal soon.""

A month after this interview, she says she’s now nearly recovered. She's one of the lucky ones. With this clinic's help, it appears she's finally shown COVID-19 the door."

A new study by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is showing evidence of possible COVID-19 infections in the U.S. as early as December 2019.

That's weeks before the first documented infection in the country.

Published in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases, this new report supports previous studies that have shown COVID-19 was circulating in the U.S. in the first two months of 2020.

Scientists at NIH say a volunteer from Illinois who gave blood on January 7, 2020 for a different study tested positive for COVID-19 antibodies.

Antibodies take about 14 days to develop, indicating the virus might have been present in Illinois as early as December.

The first reported U.S. infection was confirmed on January 20 in Washington state. The patient had traveled from Wuhan, China.

The UK government is willing to delay the fourth and final step out of England's lockdown set for June 21, according to health secretary Matt Hancock. The date is when all social restrictions are due to be eased in the country as part of a roadmap that has seen rules gradually lifted since March.

But speaking to the BBC on Sunday, Hancock said officials were ready to push back the process ""if that's what needs to happen"". With more than 40 million people receiving at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine in the UK, the risk of hospitalization and death as a result of COVID-19 has reduced significantly. But, in recent weeks, infections have risen sharply. According to government data, in the last 7 days, there were more than 31,000 new cases - a 46 percent rise on the previous week. That has led to concerns that opening up further will spread the virus, in particular, the Delta variant first discovered in India.

Finance ministers from the Group of Seven rich nations are meeting in person for the first time since the start of the COVID pandemic, after U.S. President Joe Biden's administration gave fresh impetus to stalled global tax talks this year.

Eco death: What can we do with our bodies?

Rich nations have struggled for years to agree a way to raise more tax from large multinationals such as Google, Amazon and Facebook, which often book profits in jurisdictions where they pay little or no tax.

""We are just one millimetre away from a historic agreement,"" French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire told the BBC, sentiments echoed by German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz.

Opening the summit, which is tackling a broad range of issues from climate to recovery from the pandemic, UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the nations ""need to meet our ambitions on tackling climate change and ensuring that the way we tax large, global, especially digital, companies is fair and fit for the modern age.""

In a letter on Friday, the finance ministers of France, Italy and Germany said they would work together to define ""a common position on a new international tax system"" at the meetings.

U.S. Treasury Secretary, Janet Yellen, has proposed a minimum global tax rate of 15 percent. That is significantly lower than most G7 states currently have in place, but the plans were expected to face opposition from other economies that benefit from multinationals setting up bases there. Ireland - a member of the European Union - has a corporate tax rate of 12.5 percent, for example.

And there is likely to be plenty of opposition from the companies affected, especially global tech firms whose services are digital and naturally unconstrained by borders.

In recent years, some governments have called for the likes of Facebook and Google to pay more taxes in the countries they operate in and when they benefit from people using their services. The UK and France are two nations that have planned a digital services tax on technology giants.

Such moves were strongly opposed by president Trump but his successor in the White House, Joe Biden, has shown more willingness to tax large corporations.

Sunak said the fact that tech firms were so dominant in our daily lives meant new rules needed to be established.

""It is increasingly clear that in a complex, global, digital economy, we cannot continue to rely on a tax system that was largely designed in the 1920s. And I will just say this: the world has noticed. And I believe they have high expectations for what we all can agree over the coming days.""

Any concrete progress out of the London meetings will require broader support though. A gathering of the wider G20 economies in Italy in June is one possible date when more international consensus can be tested.

The stakes are high but any changing of the rules will face strong resistance from governments and businesses alike.

421,UK hospitals turn to e-cigarettes in fight against tobacco,"The UK government is handing out electronic cigarettes (e-cigs) at hospitals to try to help people stop smoking.

The trial scheme provides vaping starter kits to patients after they have visited emergency wards. It is initially being tested at four hospitals in England and Edinburgh's Royal Infirmary in Scotland.

Research has shown that e-cigs can help people quit tobacco, according to Caitlin Notley, professor of addiction sciences at the University of East Anglia, which is helping with the trials.

""We know from the latest evidence that e-cigarettes are now the most popular consumer choice for those who are deciding to switch from tobacco smoking. Perhaps a really attractive option because they're not necessarily a medical device so people can go and buy them, they can try different strengths, different types and find something that suits their needs,"" she told CGTN Europe.

The plan is hoping to reach 1,000 participants in total, with some being monitored for progress at one-, three- and six-month intervals.

The government's backing of e-cigarettes could be significant for the UK's fight against tobacco-related illnesses. Data reviewed by Public Health England estimates that vaping is 95 percent less harmful than tobacco smoking.

May 31 marks World No Tobacco Day. Every year, 78,000 people die from smoking in the UK, with many more living with serious illnesses.

""If we can show that the intervention is effective at helping people to switch from smoking, then clearly there are important cost implications as well,” said Notley.

""A vape starter kit might cost around 20 pounds ($28) but the long-term savings for the health service in terms of not having to treat tobacco-related illness are potentially billions of pounds.""

If successful, the trial could see the UK's National Health Service regularly provide e-cigarettes.

That would be welcome news for the businesses selling the products. John Garcia, manager of a vaping shop in south London, said most customers are existing smokers looking to kick the habit – a trend that's accelerated recently due to COVID-19.

""You get the nicotine content without inhaling all the toxins that are in a cigarette and it's better because it doesn't ruin the teeth, they don't get stains on their fingers, it doesn't ruin your clothes or make them smell.""

But as a relatively nascent industry, the long-term health implications of vaping are still unclear, according to Notley: ""Most of the evidence we have at the moment comes from people who've switched from tobacco smoking, so any damage we might see may have already been caused by earlier tobacco smoking.""

There are also concerns around the addictiveness of vaping. But as things stand, UK policymakers see value in e-gigs as a harm-reduction option that is preferable to traditional forms of tobacco."

With customers forced to stay away, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a major impact on the sector. At the NHM, 50 percent of revenue is derived from visitor-related income.

Government grants and funding have helped keep many theaters and museums going for the past year but there are concerns some smaller venues may have to shut for good because of financial pressures.

China's service trade deficit narrows in the first eight months. /CFP

China's service trade went up 9.4 percent year-on-year to top 3.27 trillion yuan ($504.21 billion) in the first eight months of the year, among which the trade in knowledge-intensive services jumped while travel still mired in decline, official data showed on Sunday.

Trade in knowledge-intensive services rose 12 percent year on year in the January-August period, accounts for 45.1 percent of the total service trade, data from the Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) showed.

Cross-border restrictions resulted from the COVID-19 containment measures continued to weigh on international travel. As a result, trade in travel services dropped 30.1 percent year on year to 506.48 billion yuan in the first eight months of the year.

China has logged a marked drop in service trade deficit during the period as the growth of service trade exports outpaced that of imports by 27.1 percentage points.

Of the total, service exports reached approximately 1.55 trillion yuan, and service imports stood at 1.72 trillion yuan, MOFCOM data showed.

Compared with the same period in 2019, however, service trade dropped 8.4 percent, with service exports up 22.6 percent and service imports down 25.4 percent.

In August alone, the country's service trade reached 462.47 billion yuan, up 24.8 percent year on year.

China has taken a slew of measures to widen the opening-up of the service industry, including issuing the first negative list for cross-border services trade in July.

Situated in northwest China, Xinjiang covers an area of 1.66 million square kilometers. After years of development, Xinjiang has grown from a backland in the northwest into a transportation hub of the Silk Road Economic Belt.

Xinjiang's transport sector has seen robust growth with state support in the form of funds, technology and policies. By the end of 2020, its roads in rural areas totaled 174,400 kilometers in length.

Expressways can greatly slash travel time and accelerate the flow of people, capital and information. The network also serves as a strong catalyst to support economic development and urbanization.

Currently, China's expressway network connects nearly 98.6 percent of cities and regions where the urban population exceeds 200,000, according to China's Ministry of Transport.

444,"Tesla vehicle deliveries hit record in Q3, beat analysts' estimates","Tesla Inc. said on Saturday it had delivered a record electric cars in the third quarter, beating Wall Street estimates after Chief Executive Elon Musk asked staff to ""go super hardcore"" to make a quarter-end delivery push.

Tesla has weathered the chip crisis better than rivals, with its overall deliveries surging 20 percent in the July to September period from its previous record in the second quarter, marking the sixth consecutive quarter-on-quarter gains.

In China, rising exports to Europe and the introduction of a cheaper Model Y helped boost Tesla's production, analysts said.

Musk said Tesla suffered an extremely severe parts shortage earlier in the third quarter and had urged employees to make quarter-end delivery push, Reuters reported last month, citing an internal company email.

""The end-of-quarter delivery wave is unusually high this time,"" he said in the email.

Tesla delivered 241,300 vehicles globally in the July to September quarter, up 73 percent from a year earlier. Analysts had expected the electric-car maker to deliver 229,242 vehicles, according to Refinitiv data.

General Motors, Honda and some of its bigger rivals posted declines in U.S. sales in the third quarter, hit by a prolonged chip shortage. GM's third-quarter U.S. sales fell nearly 33 percent to its lowest level in more than a decade.

Tesla said it delivered 232,025 of its Model 3 compact cars and Model Y sport-utility vehicles and 9,275 of its flagship Model S and Model X cars to customers in the quarter.

Total production in the third quarter rose over 15 percent to 237,823 vehicles from the prior quarter.

China

Gary Black, portfolio manager at the Future Fund and a Tesla bull, said that Tesla's deliveries were driven by record deliveries in China, which was ""putting to rest any notion China demand is slowing.""

Tesla faces scrutiny from both regulators and the public and growing competition from local rivals.

Tesla has not released its September China sales yet, and in August, its Shanghai factory exported more than two-thirds of its vehicles to Europe and Asian countries."
445,China falls off H&M's top ten sales markets in Q3 2021,"In the same period last year, China ranked fifth on the sales list, with net sales of SEK 2.46 billion (about $281 million). This year, Spain became the tenth largest sales market with net sales of SEK 1.55 billion.

China fell off the list of Swedish retailer H&M's top ten markets in the Q3 (June-August) 2021, according to the company's financial results released Thursday.

Chief Executive Officer Helena Helmersson described their China operations as a ""complex situation"" and declined to comment on the annual sales drop in the country in Q3, according to a transcript of the conference call.

In the second quarter, the company saw a plunge of 23 percent in its China sales, failing to ""regain the trust of customers and partners in China"" after widespread backlash against the brand for boycotting sourcing cotton from northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.

The company was blocked by several Chinese online platforms and apps as anger on social media rose to a fever pitch in March, with H&M stores in the country seeing few customers since then.

The company's net sales increased by 9 percent in the third quarter this year to SEK 55.6 billion, compared with the corresponding period last year.

Sales in the quarter continued to be affected by the ongoing pandemic, with considerable variation between markets. Lockdowns and restrictions have continued to hamper development, particularly in Asia, according to the results.

""The pandemic and its consequences are not yet over and we are humbled by the many challenges in the world around us that affect our business, which call for a high level of flexibility and drive,"" said Helmersson in a statement on the company's website.

As for the current quarter, the company said sales were affected by supply delays.

""Sales in September 2021 were slightly higher than in the corresponding month the previous year in local currencies, even though demand was not able to be fully met because of disruption and delays in product flow. Currently around 50 stores are temporarily closed,"" said H&M's nine-month report also published Thursday."
446,"U.S. consumer spending increases, inflation eroding buying power","U.S. consumer spending surged in August, but outlays adjusted for inflation were weaker than initially thought in the prior month, reinforcing expectations that economic growth slowed in the third quarter as COVID-19 infections flared up.

The report from the Commerce Department on Friday, which showed inflation remaining hot in August, raised the risk of consumer spending stalling in the third quarter, even if spending accelerates further in September. Inflation-adjusted, or the so-called real consumer spending is what goes into the calculation of gross domestic product.

Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, rebounded 0.8 percent in August. Data for July was revised down to show spending dipping 0.1 percent instead of gaining 0.3 percent as previously reported.

Economists polled by Reuters had forecast consumer spending increasing 0.6 percent in August.

""Third quarter consumer spending is on track for only a scant gain,"" said Tim Quinlan, a senior economist at Wells Fargo in Charlotte, North Carolina. ""If COVID cases keep falling and sentiment turns positive, there is scope for a more solid finish to this tumultuous year.""

Consumption was boosted by a 1.2-percent rise in purchases of goods, reflecting increases in spending on food and household supplies as well as recreational items, which offset a drop in motor vehicle outlays. A global shortage of semiconductors is undercutting the production of automobiles.

Goods spending fell 2.1 percent in July. Spending on services rose 0.6 percent in August, supported by housing, utilities and health care. Services, which account for the bulk of consumer spending, increased 1.1 percent in July. Spending is shifting back to services from goods, but the resurgence in coronavirus cases, driven by the Delta variant, crimped demand for air travel, hotel accommodation and sales at restaurants and bars.

Inflation maintained its upward trend in August, though price pressures have probably peaked. The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, excluding the volatile food and energy components, climbed 0.3 percent after increasing by the same margin in July. In the 12 months through August, the so-called core PCE price index increased 3.6 percent, matching July's gain.

The core PCE price index is the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure for its flexible 2 percent target. The U.S. central bank last week upgraded its core PCE inflation projection for this year to 3.7 percent from 3.0 percent back in June.

The Fed said it would likely begin reducing its monthly bond purchases as soon as November and signaled interest rate increases may follow more quickly than expected. Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who has maintained that high inflation is transitory, told lawmakers on Thursday that he anticipated some relief in the months ahead.

Still, inflation could remain high for a while. A survey from the Institute for Supply Management on Friday showed manufacturers experienced longer delays getting raw materials delivered to factories and paid higher prices for inputs in September."

449,The Biden administration will unveil China trade strategy on Monday,"United States Trade Representative, Katherine Tai is poised to announce the Biden administration's long-awaited trade strategy with China on Monday.

Tai will unveil the U.S. trade approaches towards China in a speech at the Center for Strategic and International Studies before joining a question-and-answer session.

The announcement comes nine months after Biden's election as the U.S. president. Major U.S. business groups have expressed that the slow roll-out of a new U.S.-China trade policy has harmed business and urged the Biden administration to cut tariffs on China.

China and the U.S. signed the phase-one trade agreement in 2020, covering the two years for purchase commitments between January 1, 2020, and December 31, 2021.

China's Ministry of Commerce spokesperson Shu Yuting, reiterated on Thursday that China-U.S. trade cooperation is not only beneficial for both countries, but also for the world at large. Increased tariffs are detrimental to the recovery of the world economy and have caused heavy pressure and losses on companies and consumers in the two countries, she added."
450,Oil settles near 3-year high ahead of OPEC+ meeting,"Oil settled above $78 a barrel on Friday, just shy of a three-year high reached earlier this week, on expectations that OPEC ministers will maintain a steady pace in raising supply.

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies, known as OPEC+, meets on Monday. The group is slowly unwinding record output cuts made last year, although sources say it is considering doing more to boost production.

Brent crude rose 97 cents, or 1.2 percent, to settle at $79.28 in its fourth weekly rise. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) rose 85 cents to settle at $75.88 in a sixth week of gains.

Brent has risen over 50 percent this year and reached a three-year high of $80.75 on Tuesday.

OPEC+ is facing pressure from consumers such as the United States and India to produce more to help reduce prices as demand has recovered faster than anticipated in some parts of the world.

""If OPEC+ sticks to the script and only delivers the planned 400,000 bpd increase in November, energy markets will shortly be seeing $90 oil prices,"" said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA, adding that any increase smaller than 600,000 barrels should boost prices.

Oil is also finding support as a surge in natural gas prices globally prompts power producers to move away from gas. Generators in Pakistan, Bangladesh and the Middle East have started switching fuels.

""The most likely reason for stable oil prices is that investors believe the supply-demand gap will widen as the power crisis worsens,"" said Naeem Aslam, an analyst at Avatrade.

U.S. energy firms this week added oil and natural gas rigs for a fourth week in a row as more storm-hit offshore units resumed service in the Gulf of Mexico.

Rigs rose by 7 to 528 in the week to October 1, the highest since April 2020, energy services firm Baker Hughes Co. said in its closely followed report on Friday."

General Motors reported a sharp drop in third-quarter U.S. sales on Friday as the global semiconductor crunch depletes dealerships of auto supply amid still-strong consumer demand.

The U.S. automaker giant described auto inventories as ""historically low"" after months of limited semiconductor supply, which has led to manufacturing outages and cuts throughout its plant network.

GM reported third-quarter sales of 446,997 in the United States, down almost a third from the year-ago period.

In the most recent quarter, the chip shortage was exacerbated by a surge in COVID-19 cases in Malaysia, which is home to key semiconductor capacity.

But Steve Carlisle, executive vice president of GM North America, said the issues with chips ""are improving"" and that it looks forward to a ""more stable operating environment through the fall.""

One upside of the supply crunch for automakers has been rising vehicle prices, which can help offset some of the pain from lower sales.

In the third quarter, GM's average vehicle price was $47,467, up almost 32 percent from the equivalent period in 2018.

""While supply has been constraining sales in recent months, underlying demand conditions remain strong, thanks to ample job openings, growing pent-up vehicle demand and excess savings accumulated by many households during the pandemic,"" said GM Chief Economist Elaine Buckberg.

""We expect to continue selling every vehicle we can produce with rapid turnover."""
452,Facebook research shows it knew of Instagram harm to teens: senators,"U.S. senators on Thursday grilled Facebook Inc. on its plans to better protect young users on its apps, drawing on leaked internal research that showed the social media giant was aware of how its Instagram app harmed the mental health of teens.

The hearing in front of the Senate Consumer Protection Subcommittee was called after the Wall Street Journal published several stories earlier this month about how Facebook knew Instagram caused some teen girls in particular to feel badly about their self-image. After growing opposition to the project, Facebook put plans for Instagram Kids, aimed at pre-teens, on hold this week.

Antigone Davis, Facebook's global head of safety, disputed the committee and WSJ's conclusions of the research documents throughout the hearing, and said the company was working to release additional internal studies in an effort to be more transparent about its findings.

""This research is a bombshell,"" said Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat, during the hearing. ""It is powerful, gripping, riveting evidence that Facebook knows of the harmful effects of its site on children, and that it has concealed those facts and findings.""

""IG stands for Instagram, but it also stands for Insta-greed,"" said Senator Edward Markey, a Democrat from Massachusetts.

The senators pressed Davis on several major themes, including what identifiable data Facebook collects on users under the age of 13, to what extent the company views young users as a growth area and to confirm whether it knew that Instagram led some children to consider suicide.

Davis reiterated that kids under 13 were not allowed on Facebook, adding 0.5 percent of teens in the company's research connected their ""suicidal ideation"" to Instagram, lower than the figures the Journal had reported.

""You've cherry-picked part of the research that you think helps your spin right now,"" said Senator Ted Cruz, a Republican from Texas, demanding Facebook commit to releasing its full research on the links between Instagram and youth suicide.

A second hearing is planned for Tuesday and will feature a Facebook whistleblower. The whistleblower is expected to reveal their identity on Sunday in a recorded interview for TV news program ""60 Minutes,"" which in a preview described the woman as a former Facebook employee who left with tens of thousands of pages of research.

Davis said Thursday that Facebook would not retaliate against the whistleblower for sharing confidential documents with the senators."

PwC employees who choose to work virtually would have to come into the office a maximum of three days a month for in-person appointments such as critical team meetings, client visits and learning sessions, Seals-Coffield said.

PwC's deputy people leader, Yolanda Seals-Coffield, said in an interview that the firm was the first in its industry to make full-time virtual work available to client services employees. PwC's support staff and employees in areas such as human resources and legal operations that do not face clients already had the option to work virtually full-time.

The policy is a departure from the accounting industry's rigid attitudes, known for encouraging people to put in late nights at the office. Other major accounting firms, such as Deloitte and KPMG, have also been giving employees more choice to work remotely in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Accounting and consulting firm PwC told Reuters on Thursday it will allow all its 40,000 U.S. client services employees to work virtually and live anywhere they want in perpetuity, making it one of the biggest employers to embrace permanent remote work.

""We have learned a ton through the pandemic, and working virtually, as we think about the evolution of flexibility, is a natural next step,"" Seals-Coffield said. ""If you are an employee in good standing, are in client services, and want to work virtually, you can, full stop.""

Location does factor, however, into PwC employees' pay, Seals-Coffield said. Employees who opt to work virtually full-time from a lower-cost location would see their pay decrease, she added.

Alphabet's Google also bases employees' pay on their location, with those who work from home permanently potentially earning less.

Most U.S. white-collar workers have been working from home since the pandemic took hold in March 2020. Chief executives have grappled with bringing employees back, weighing their management style and preferences against risks such as more contagious COVID-19 variants and workers rejecting vaccines.

PwC said in a memo to employees this week that it is offering the new policy to attract and retain talent and become more diverse. Partners at PwC whose team members choose to be in the office regularly will not be allowed to work completely remotely.

""We're confident we can manage hybrid teams,"" Seals-Coffield said. She added that PwC's research suggests that 30 percent to 35 percent of its eligible workers will take the firm up on the offer. PwC has 55,000 U.S. employees in total, and with its new policy, the majority will be able to work virtually if they want.

Seals-Coffield said PwC is not planning to make any significant changes to its real estate footprint due to the new policy. The firm plans to use its office space differently and in more collaborative ways, she said, without elaborating. PwC is globally headquartered in London, with its U.S. head office in New York.

In addition to providing auditing and accounting services, PwC consults with companies on issues such as return to the office. Asked about how PwC's new policy would inform its advice to clients on the topic, Seals-Coffield said that other organizations are deciding how to approach it ""in ways that work for their workforce.""

In June, PwC said it would hire 100,000 people over the next five years in jobs that would help clients report on diversity and climate. The firm currently employs 284,000 globally.

A spokesman for Deloitte said on Thursday the ""range of time spent at client sites, at Deloitte offices, and remotely will vary.""

The firm said in June all of its 20,000 employees in Britain would be allowed to choose in the future whether they work from home or not."

Chinese cryptocurrency exchange Huobi Global stopped taking new customers from the Chinese mainland on Friday and would end contracts with clients in the region by the end of 2021 to comply with local regulations, the exchange said in a statement on Saturday.

Shares of crypto asset management and trading firm Huobi Tech, an affiliate of Huobi Global, one of the world's largest exchanges, fell more than 30 percent after the opening bell.

China's central bank said on Friday that all virtual currency-related activities are illegal, according to a notice jointly issued by 11 agencies, including People's Bank of China, the Cyberspace Administration of China and China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission, in a further crackdown on virtual money trading and speculation.

Virtual currency should not and cannot be used as currency in the Chinese market, and overseas virtual currency exchanges that provide services for domestic residents via the internet are also considered illegal financial activities, the notice said.

OKG Technology Holdings, a fintech and construction company majority-owned by Xu Mingxing, the founder of crypto exchange OK Coin, fell more than 20 percent.

However, cryptocurrencies traded firmly on Monday, having rebounded from selling driven by the Chinese crackdown as buy-the-dip speculators swooped in.

Bitcoin was up about 2.4 percent in Asia trade at $44,250, having fallen to just below $41,000 in the wake of Friday's announcement.

Rival token ether rose 3 percent to $3,163 and has recouped its Friday losses.

Global oil demand is expected to reach pre-pandemic levels by early next year as the economy recovers, although spare refining capacity could weigh on the outlook, producers and traders said at an industry conference on Monday.

The outlook is in line with a forecast from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), but ahead of estimates from the International Energy Agency (IEA).

Global demand is seen rising to 100 million barrels per day (bpd) by end-2021 or in the first quarter of 2022, energy company Hess Corp President Greg Hill said.

The world consumed 99.7 million bpd of oil in 2019, according to the IEA, before the COVID-19 pandemic hammered economic activities and fuel demand.

While a persistent rise in COVID-19 cases across markets has hurt recovery in demand for some refined products such as jet fuel, consumption trends of petrol and diesel indicate growth, industry leaders noted at the Asia Pacific Petroleum Conference (APPEC 2021) conference.

""We witnessed a lot of demand destruction as a consequence of reduced economic activity, disruption to transportation, disruption to free flow of goods ... But that's past us,"" said Alan Heng, interim CEO of Singapore's Pavilion Energy.

""We are dealing with the post-pandemic period and we are learning to live with the virus ... Energy demand has started to pick up and that's good news for us.""

Recovering demand is expected to boost profits for refiners and create room for returning or new production, but experts warn that spare refining capacity would be a drag.

""There's still a lot of unutilised capacity and a lot of capacity has been taken off stream,"" said Eugene Leong, president of BP Singapore and CEO of BP's trading and shipping arm of Asia Pacific and the Middle East.

""The spare (refining) capacity is probably going to act as a little bit of a cap on margins,"" he said.

""This year alone we've seen some mega refining (and) petrochemical complexes start up, so I think that's going to be challenging for refining."""

China launched its long-awaited Southbound Bond Connect on Friday in the latest step to deepen financial cooperation between the Chinese mainland and Hong Kong.

The program enables institutional investors in the Chinese mainland to invest in the Hong Kong bond market. The annual quota of the program is currently set at 500 billion yuan ($77.38 billion), with a daily quota of 20 billion yuan.

Bank of China (Hong Kong), HSBC Holdings and Standard Chartered are among the banks conducting trades on the first trading day. More than 40 mainland institutional investors and 11 Hong Kong market makers conducted more than 150 bond transactions worth approximately 4 billion yuan on Friday, the Bank of China data showed.

Established in July 2017, the Northbound Bond Connect, which allows overseas investors to trade bonds on the Chinese mainland, has hit 12.3 trillion yuan in accumulated turnover over the past four years.

The bond connection is also seen as an effort to further interlink the country's Greater Bay Area, including southern China's Guangdong Province and the Hong Kong and Macao Special Administrative Regions."

Editor's note: James Rae is a professor at California State University Sacramento. He was also a Fulbright Scholar at Beijing Foreign Studies University from 2017 to 2018. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN. The United States is the world's largest debtor nation, with an accumulated federal debt now topping $28 trillion. While the debt to GDP ratio has been growing once again, and is near a peak, it may be sustainable for now, but growing questions about its future impact are looming.

The ability of the U.S. to maintain its dominant position in global affairs, in both the security and economic realm, depend heavily on the health and management of its domestic affairs. The long-term future competitiveness of the American economy is hard to predict, but runaway debts do not bode well regardless. This issue gins more clarity by the immediacy of America's debt ceiling limit legislation. In 2011, the two major American political parties faced off over the regular extension of the debt ceiling and caused insecurity in financial markets when the small risk of default appeared as a possible reality, as Standard and Poor's ultimately downgraded American sovereign debt. A decade later, we may be headed for a similar reckoning. An agreement reached between both parties to suspend the debt ceiling for two years allowed relatively smooth sailing for the crisis spending agreed upon by both parties during both the Donald Trump and Joe Biden administrations. However, that agreement is due to expire July 31. No deal is prepared in this immediate period, though the U.S. government is estimated to have the budgetary ability to persist in its functions until October or November. Therein is the background, which will then be played out like almost all political issues, in a divisive Congress keen to seek partisan advantage regarding any national debate. Senate Minority Leader, Republican Mitch McConnell pledges not to vote for raising the debt limit and hopes to force the Democratic rivals to raise the limit unilaterally using the procedure known as reconciliation where legislation can be adopted by 50 percent plus one rather than the filibuster-proof majority of 60. This would seek to make Democrats ""own"" the enlarged debt and pressure their caucus on the looming trillion-dollar spending bills.

458,Graphics: A glance at the world's busiest cargo port in east China,"The Port of Ningbo-Zhoushan in east China's Zhejiang Province stands as the world's busiest port in terms of cargo tonnage since 2009. It handled nearly 1.2 billion tonnes of cargo in 2020, while also serving as China's largest transit hub for iron ore and crude oil.

The port's cargo throughput exceeded one billion tonnes in 2017, the first in the world to cross such a benchmark.

China leads the world in cross-border trade recovery thanks to effective COVID-19 containment efforts. The country's foreign trade rose 1.5 percent to $4.65 trillion in 2020, of which exports came in at $2.59 trillion with a 3.6-percent yearly rise. The throughput of the country's major ports has recovered to the pre-pandemic level. In comparison, global leading ports in Singapore, Rotterdam and Busan recorded decline in trade volume due to drop in demand."
459,Yuan's gain may slow as fundamentals call for some calms,"Gains in China's yuan may be limited in the near term as more investors may start to be relieved that the currency's rally was a bit too fast in the past few months from the fundamental perspective. Also, the U.S. jobs report may offer some supports for the greenback.

Since the end of the first quarter, the yuan has rallied around 3 percent as China's economy has been showing persistent recovery after the pandemic, plus a weaker dollar profile. The fundamentals will continue to support the yuan with no visible depreciation pressure appearing at this moment. But certain clues indicate the pace of gains may slow down in the coming months.

The country's lenders will need to hold 7 percent of their foreign exchange in reserve from June 15, the People's Bank of China (PBOC) said in a statement on Monday. The size of the increase is 2 percentage points, and it is the first hike since 2007. The moves aim to curb the dollar liquidity as it reduces the supply of the dollar. The tighter dollar liquidity is considered to be possible to put some negative impact on the yuan.

The tweak in reserve requirement itself may have a limited direct impact on the Chinese yuan since the yuan interest rate is much higher than dollar rates. However, the message here is clear: the monetary authority may not be comfortable with recent quick gains. Some market participants who have been betting the excessive gains in yuan may start abandoning their earlier forecasts, as they could be worried that any further massive gains in yuan may cause more measures from the central bank.

And there are valid reasons for the Chinese monetary authorities to curb the excessive gains in yuan. Data released on Monday showed that China's new export orders index for the month of May fell below 50, the first time since February, suggesting the recent rising currency may have badly hurt the exporters' revenues. The CFETS RMB Index, a gauge to reflect the yuan's value against a basket of currencies, is now rising to the highest level since 2016. It may trigger the PBOC to set the yuan fixing rates weaker than expected in the near future.

On the other hand, the recent China-U.S. bond yield spread also shows that some gains in yuan could be excessive. Over a long period of time, moves in yuan versus the dollar have been in tandem with the two countries' bond yield gap. The 10-year bond yield spread between the two countries narrowed by about 50 bps in the past six months to 145 bps now, close to the level in February 2020, when the USD/CNY exchange rate stood around 6.95. Thus, the yuan upside could be limited at this stage if the yield spread between the two continues to shrink.

Based on the experience in the past five years after the PBOC reformed the yuan fixing regime, the yuan's direction has been influencing the cross-board capital flows. The rising yuan will definitely help to attract more capital inflows, boosting prices for the onshore yuan-denominated assets and further pushing forward the yuan internationalization progress.

However, if the pace of inflows is too quick, it would pose potential risks for the financial system stabilization once the Fed decides to tighten the monetary policies because some of those international ""hot cash"" with speculative nature would fight back into the dollar assets. Hence, it's necessary for the central bank to monitor the current onshore dollar liquidity in order to avoid keep the liquidity balanced.

On the dollar side, the dollar index seems to be gaining some support near the 90 levels, further downside room is seen as limited as long as the U.S. economic data shows no signs of deterioration. The labor market report to be released this Friday would be extremely crucial for all kinds of traders, as this would be the last top-tier economic data released before the next Federal Open Market Committee meeting in the middle of the month.

We expect the Fed to ""openly"" discuss the details or schedule of a tapering of the quantitative easing if the upcoming non-farm payrolls data stays above 600,000. If this happened, the 10-year Treasury yield may quickly rise to above the 1.8 percent level and push the dollar higher."

Previously, he also worked at the Federal Reserve for 18 years, most recently as director of the Division of International Finance and FOMC Economist. The article reflects the author's opinion, and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

One of the first things that new U.S. Presidential Administrations tend to learn is the difference between campaigning and governing. Candidates spin out proposals and position papers but, once in power, implementing even a fraction of them becomes a near-herculean task.

Of course, given Joe Biden's long career in Washington, including eight years as Vice President, this hardly comes as a surprise to him. Moreover, his first major legislative initiative in the form of a large fiscal package sailed through Congress in record time.

But where the new Administration seems to be getting a reality check is in the sphere of foreign policy. Secretary of State Antony Blinken's rocky summit in Alaska with his Chinese counterparts grabbed the headlines, but the emerging challenges seem more deeply rooted.

Through the election campaign, Biden and other Democrats thumped Donald Trump for the unilateral tendencies of his foreign policy. Trump had little patience with the thrust and parry of international negotiations. He preferred to use tools directly under his control, such as tariffs and sanctions.

A key plank of Biden's platform was that Trump's unilateral moves were destabilizing the globe. And the United States could achieve better outcomes working with allies, such as Europe, Japan and Australia. This was particularly true for efforts with China.

While it's still early days for the new administration, this effort to find common cause on China is facing some headwinds. The most critical of these is gaining the full participation of the European Union – the early soundings from Europe's capitals have been cautious.

In late December, as the Biden Administration was preparing to take office, the EU inked a comprehensive agreement on investment with China. While the pact arguably only brought Europe to parity with the U.S. Phase 1 deal, some observers saw it as a signal that Europe's appetite to challenge China has limits.

A joint effort to pressure China could put Europe's commercial interests at risk. Germany, in particular, is geared to the Chinese export market. Moreover, the domestic engines of European growth are lackluster and, as a result, Europe is reliant on external demand.

Confronting China is thus a difficult proposition for the Europeans. Some of this reluctance may yield to cajoling from the Biden Administration, but the differences in perspective are likely to remain consequential.

Europe's reluctance may also reflect a more fundamental issue. Renewed global engagement from the Biden Administration has been welcomed by countries around the world. Indeed, as Antony Blinken recently said – the United States is back and aims to be a constructive partner. But the reception to date has been less jubilant than might have been expected.

Perhaps this reflects that national leaders are busy fighting the coronavirus, so their energies are more domestically directed than usual. But the response may also reflect concerns about how durable this renewed U.S. partnership will be.

As countries consider joining the Biden Administration's efforts on China, they must ask themselves which of the last two election outcomes – 2016 or 2020 – is a better measure of the American electorate over the longer term? While the political winds are now blowing strongly in Biden's direction, the uncertainties are clearly significant. In contrast, the trajectory of China's policies is clear.

For the Biden Administration, these observations highlight the challenges of framing new approaches to U.S. foreign policy that are fresh, intuitive, and consistent with their values. What's clear is that they reject much of Trump's strategy and tactics. But by the same token, the world has changed appreciably since 2016, so rolling back the clock and running plays from the Obama Administration is also inadequate.

Biden's team will need to continue its efforts to hammer out a ""third way"" on an array of issues. Certainly, this includes China. But it also includes Russia, Turkey, DPRK, Iran, and much more. It is no small undertaking. And it will require time. The problem, of course, is that the ongoing flow of global events is unlikely to allow much breathing space.

461,CGTN Explains: Understanding China's carbon market,"After running pilot projects at the local level for over a decade, China officially launched its long-awaited national carbon emissions trading market on Friday.

According to China's Ministry of Ecology and Environment (MEE), China's Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) has replaced the EU's as the world's largest emissions trading system.

Here's everything you need to know about China's carbon market.

What is a carbon market?

A carbon market is where greenhouse gas emitters can buy and sell greenhouse gas emissions permits or allowances.

The government sets the cap on the total amount of carbon emissions for the year, then companies receive or buy emissions quotas within the cap. A company must provide enough allowances to cover all its emissions yearly or face a fine. They can trade carbon emission allowances with one another on the trading platform.

In China's ETS, the majority of the allowances are given to emitters for free; however, in most of the other carbon markets, they are purchased.

Also, China's version targets intensity rather than capping emissions.

In the EU and U.S. versions, an overall cap is set on the number of carbon credits. This is the amount of carbon the signatories of the agreement are happy to emit over a given period. China's scheme will set benchmarks for each separate power plant, which will vary between facilities. As before, those that do not exceed their quota can sell it to those that do.

Who's involved?

In the first phase, the system only covers the power sector. Over 2,000 power companies, emitting more than 4 billion tonnes of greenhouse gases per year or 40 percent of the country's yearly total, have participated.

According to MEE, seven more high energy-intensive industries, including iron and steel and construction materials, will be covered by the carbon market in the future.

Why build a carbon market?

The country is trying to use the trading scheme to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, as part of its effort to peak its emissions by 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060.

""For the first time, the responsibility for controlling greenhouse gas emissions at the national level is left to the enterprises,"" said an earlier statement released by the MEE.

What's the price?

Carbon pricing is a crucial component in deciding how effectively the carbon market can help reduce carbon emissions.

The first deal in China's ETS was sealed at 52.78 yuan ($8.16) per tonne, with a total of 160,000 tonnes of emissions worth 7.9 million yuan traded while the average carbon price on the European Union ETS between 2021-2025 is 47.25 euros ($55.67) a tonne, according to a survey by the International Emissions Trading Association.

462,Explainer: Why are there so many spectacular highways in China?,"Normally, it looks like a straight wide two-way road with many cars run on.

What do you think an expressway looks like?

So, why does China have so many mega highways?

The country has the world's highest expressway Beipanjiang Bridge, and the world's longest desert highway, spanning from its capital city Beijing to the far western region of Xinjiang. The country is also home to the longest sea-crossing bridge, the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge.

The first reason is geographical complexity. The third largest country owns a territory of 9.6 million square kilometers, with different geographical conditions, meaning that expressways can be above ground, through mountains or even under water.

In south China's Guizhou Province, where the Beipanjiang Bridge is located, over 90 percent of its land is mountainous and its average altitude is more than 1,000 meters. More than 20,000 bridges connect traffic in the mountains and there are barely any plains in the region.

To build roads there, you must tackle bridges and tunnels instead.

Besides mountains, deserts, rivers, jungles and coastlines have all made China's highways very diversified.

The second decisive factor for China to build these roads comes from its economic and technological power.

China has been building highways at an amazing high speed. Since 1988, when the country's first expressway – the Shanghai-Jiading Expressway was completed, China has built over 160,000 kilometers in expressways, which is the most of any country in the world.

The reason behind this efficiency is China's economic model. Nearly all of the highways were built by state-owned enterprises (SOEs), meaning that should the country need this, they can be built at once.

State-owned giants do not have to consider the financial returns of these projects, because the SOEs backed by the government, shoulder the responsibilities of promoting development in poor areas.

So, no matter how isolated and rural a place is, infrastructure building is aligned with the needs of the people.

And that's essentially why so many mega projects have come true in China.

463,Carbon emissions trading explained: How will the UK system work?,"The UK is about to launch its own carbon trading system, with a first auction of permits on May 19. It replaces the European Union Emissions Trading System (ETS), the world's first and biggest carbon trading market, of which the country had been part until leaving the bloc. The scheme is part of the UK efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and become a net-zero economy by 2050.

Carbon trading puts a price on a country or company's carbon emissions to encourage a reduction in greenhouse gases. /Reuters/Shamil Zhumatov/File Carbon trading puts a price on a country or company's carbon emissions to encourage a reduction in greenhouse gases. /Reuters/Shamil Zhumatov/File

What is carbon trading? Carbon trading is a market-based system that allows companies and governments to buy and sell permits and credits to emit carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. It emerged as a direct result of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol calling for a united front to reduce pollutant emissions, carbon trading is technically a market practice that punishes big polluters and rewards those who cut back on emissions. The most commonly used and considered most efficient carbon trading model is the so-called ""cap and trade"" scheme. It sets an overall limit or ""cap"" on the amount of greenhouse gas emissions, which industries and companies have to respect. Though issues of corruption and a set of different issues have emerged in connection with the system, carbon trading is a measure increasingly being adopted to slow down the rates of emission.

How does it work? Almost all carbon trading schemes use the ""cap and trade"" principle mentioned above. In such as scheme, governments usually set a legal limit on emissions over a specific period of time and give away a number of emissions allowances to those companies responsible for CO2 emissions, either free or auctioned. One permit equals about one ton of CO2 equivalent released into the atmosphere. At the moment in the EU, prices are around 56 euros ($68) a ton. The UK, unlike the EU, has set a legal minimum price of 22 pounds ($31) a ton. Technically, if a company ""spends"" all its available credits but still emits more CO2 than its permits can cover, the company will be forced to buy carbon credits from a less-polluting company to cover its exceeding emissions, or pay a heavy fine. Companies that save up their allowances can keep them to cover future needs or sell them to companies that are running short of them. This system puts a price on emissions – something that should encourage companies to become greener and represents an incentive for those companies that, by reducing their emissions, are able to sell their credits to big polluters and make a profit out of it.

Despite controversies around carbon trading, there's no sizable alternative to this system currently available. /Reuters/Lisi Niesner Despite controversies around carbon trading, there's no sizable alternative to this system currently available. /Reuters/Lisi Niesner

How big is it and who's involved? In a 2020 report the World Bank said there were 31 Emissions Trading Schemes and 30 carbon taxes operating globally, covering 22 percent of the world's greenhouse gas emissions. That's up from just two in 1990, when Finland and Poland introduced carbon taxes. The world's first international carbon trading system was the EU ETS, set up in 2005. It involves more than 10,000 companies from all EU member states plus Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland and covers around 40 percent of the EU's greenhouse gas emissions. On a national level, carbon trading systems are also operating in countries including China, Japan, the U.S., Canada, New Zealand, South Korea and Switzerland. Collaboration between countries for bilateral agreement on international carbon trading schemes are also under way, as between the EU and China.

What are the benefits? Carbon trading systems bring positive results. According to data from the European Commission, companies under the EU ETS reduced emissions by about 35 percent between 2005 and 2019. For governments, cap and trade schemes are now the go-to policy to decrease carbon dioxide emissions, whereas the idea of imposing a carbon tax proves much less popular among businesses.

What's the criticism? Despite its successful results, carbon trading remains somewhat controversial. According to critics of the system, carbon trading is just a distraction and a delay from the real, drastic action needed to tackle the climate crisis: radically cutting emissions through structural changes that will move the world towards a low-carbon economy."
464,Explainer: Why has China built so many expressways?,"China's expressway network has a total length of 160,000 kilometers, longer than anywhere else in the world. Connecting hundreds of millions of people, it took the country some four decades to build.

But, does China need that many expressways?

The answer is yes, for sure.

In China, there's a saying: ""To get rich, you must build a road first."" Compared to normal roads, efficiency is via expressways.

In 1988, the country's first expressway – Shanghai-Jiading Expressway, was completed and opened to the public. The smooth roads have cut the travel time between the two places in half.

""The express highways can greatly shorten the time distance among regions and accelerate the flow of people, capital, information and knowledge,"" said Li Hongchang, associate professor at Beijing Jiaotong University, in an earlier interview with CGTN, adding ""In particularly for the businessman and cold chain logistics [which] are very sensitive to the time efficiency.""

Besides improving regional connectivity, the network also serves as a strong catalyst to support economic development and urbanization.

The most crowded expressway areas are near China's richest places. The three biggest metropolitan areas, centered Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou, have way more expressways than the rest of the country.

Currently, China's expressway network connects nearly 98.6 percent of cities and regions where the urban population exceeds 200,000, according to China's Ministry of Transport.

And the effort doesn't stop there as officials are vowing to cover all cities and counties with a population exceeding 100,000 by 2035.

But it will not be just about coverage, officials are working to present a ""smart"" road network, or digital infrastructure. It will make use of the big data system – Beidou satellite navigation, through which autonomous driving may not be far away.

Coastal regions in China have emphasized advancing the blue economy over the past years, valuing the significant contribution that the ocean economy makes to the GDP. China's marine economy has maintained stable growth over the past two decades, increasing from 930.2 billion yuan ($144 billion) in 2001 to 8.94 trillion yuan in 2019, with an average annual growth rate of about 13 percent. However, affected by the COVID-19 outbreak and the complex international environment, the gross ocean product of China shrunk by 10.5 percent year on year to 8 trillion yuan in 2020, according to the Ministry of Natural Resources (MNR). China's marine economy consists of three marine economic zones in the north, east and south of the country. The east marine zone, or the East China Sea, encompassing Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Fujian provinces and the Shanghai Municipality, contributed about a half of China's gross ocean product from 2018 to 2020.

Amid the COVID-19 blow, the blue economy in the east zone also experienced a drop along with the entire country, decreasing by 4.1 percent to 3.62 trillion yuan in 2020. During last year, the growth of three industries – coastal and marine tourism, oil and gas and construction – in the east zone were dragged down by COVID-19, while other industries achieved positive growth, the East China Sea Bureau of the MNR said.

COVID-19 stopped the fastest-growing coastal and marine tourism industry, causing it to fall from an 800.9 billion yuan industry in 2019 to 658.2 billion yuan in 2020. The coastal and marine tourism industry, the marine transportation industry and the fishery industry are the pillars of the ocean economy in the east zone, accounting for 50.11 percent, 20.08 percent, and 13.81 percent, respectively, in 2020."
471,Graphics: What makes China's Changsha a creative city?,"Changsha City, capital of central China's Hunan Province, was ranked among the top 10 most popular tourist destinations in the country during the five-day Labor Day holiday from May 1 to 5 and was rated one of the cities with the best nightlife. Hundreds of thousands of tourists flocked to the city by high-speed railway or air – many just for a cup of milk tea or a plate of crayfish, even if it meant queuing up for hours.



So, what's behind Changsha's popularity?

Economic prowess Since 2017, Changsha has secured a place among cities having a GDP of over 1 trillion yuan (about $145 billion per 2020 average exchange rate). In 2020, there were 23 cities in the 1-trillion-yuan club.

'Capital of construction machinery' What many may not know is that Changsha, apart from being an ""online celebrity,"" is also the ""capital of construction machinery."" In 2020, Changsha's construction machinery industry posted a total output value of 250 billion yuan (about $36 billion), ranking first in China in terms of scale for 10 consecutive years and accounting for about 27.5 percent of the national total and 7.2 percent of the global total.

With an increasing contribution from the tertiary sector, Changsha's industrial structure is continuing to be optimized.

A lucrative cultural sector Moreover, Changsha's cultural sector is a pillar of its economy. The sector's share in the local economy is greater than the ones in most capital cities, with the added value accounting for 9 percent of the local GDP and a gross output of 300 billion yuan (about $43.5 billion), Mayor Zheng Jianxin said in November 2020. The fireworks industry accounted for over 30 percent of Changsha's cultural sector. Tourists on Orange Island, a popular destination in Changsha, enjoy a visual feast of fireworks during major public holidays.

Nighttime economy – consumption in cities between 6 p.m. and 6 a.m. – features eating, sightseeing, shopping, sports, exhibitions and performances, providing more possibilities for people to enjoy their night hours outside their home.

In the central part of China, the city of Changsha, the capital of Hunan Province, is one of many cities that never sleeps."
473,Graphics: Changsha - an average inland city's catch-up path,"On China's Instagram-like social media platform Xiaohongshu, a landlocked city Changsha, outcompeting metropolises like Shanghai and Beijing, catapulted into the most-searched domestic destination during this year's labor-day holiday. The number of tourists experienced a whopping 130.3-percent year-on-year ascent, according to data released by the local authorities in May. To some extent, online search trends and a jump in the number of tourists validate the city's now-found celebrity. But what's driving the craze is not merely an internet fad but a rising city with rapid economic progress. In 2017, Changsha, the capital of central China's Hunan Province also known for the birthplace of the country's founding father Mao Zedong, has become the 13th member to join China's ""trillion-yuan club,"" a group now consisting of 23 cities with each of its annual GDP exceeding 1 trillion yuan (about $154 billion). Its GDP growth rate jumped to the top spot just two years after being admitted to the club.

For people to better understand what a thriving metropolitan economy looks like, the population size and urbanization rate are non-negligible indicators. The city's population has more than doubled in the past seven decades. The urbanization rate also increased sharply along with the expansion of the non-agriculture population as well as the transformation of economic structure.

During the early days of the new China, from 1950s to 1970s, Changsha's economy was dominated by agricultural and low value-added services. Agriculture output was at the mercy of weather conditions. But with the ""reform and opening-up"" campaign rolling out across the country since 1978, Changsha has gradually transformed into an industrialized city with the manufacturing sector at its core.

At the turn of the millennium, a series of national policies and initiatives aiming to boost the development in central China also contributed to the city's economic structure transformation. The removal of investment restrictions, more favorable tax treatment, and enhanced infrastructure and connectivity to coastal commercial gateways all promoted the flourish of local business, a World Bank working report analyzing Changsha's development shows. At the end of 2018, the number of industrial enterprises whose annual revenue exceeding 20 million yuan (about $3 million) reached almost 3,000. Most of them were in the manufacturing industry, accounting for 97.5 percent of the total companies in the secondary sector.

Besides, Changsha is home to four of the world's top 50 construction machinery manufacturers. Sany, one of China's biggest machinery makers, has even been branded as a model demonstration facility for Beijing's plan to upgrade the national manufacturing industry. According to Hu Henghua, former Secretary of Changsha Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, the city's development lies on the manufacturing industry, their advantage comes from it, and the future growth cannot keep without it. Notably, the city's shining development report card is driven by not only the high-speed but the high-quality. Over the years, the fourth industrial revolution marked by the artificial intelligence and some other cutting-edge technologies has ushered Changsha into a new stage. Those traditional manufacturing tycoons repositioned themselves into intelligence-based companies, transitioning from original equipment manufacturers to service providers. ""The future of the heavy-equipment industry will rely as much on software and data as it does on hardware,"" Sany's Chief Information Officer Pan Ruigang said."

UEFA Euro 2020 is approaching the final, which will take place on Sunday between Italy and England. The tournament this year is a unique one, not only for being the first sporting event held after a one-year delay due to the COVID-19 hit, but also a milestone for Chinese sponsorship in UEFA. Commercial rights are the second-largest revenue source for the UEFA Euro Championship after broadcast rights, with an increased share of the total revenue this year compared to past championships.

Four Chinese companies – Hisense, Alipay, Vivo, and TikTok – are among the 12 sponsors of Euro 2020, making China the largest source of sponsorship for the tournament for the first time. Analysts say it was a smart move for Chinese companies to use this exposure for marketing to China, where there are plenty of Euro 2020 fans, and potential new customers abroad. The increase of Chinese sponsors also presented an interesting relation with the world economic landscape shifts. Top Asian sponsor: China replaces Japan Japanese companies sponsored every Euro Championship from 1992 to 2012, thanks to the country's leading consumer electronics development. During this period, China's economy saw increasing momentum from 1998, with the gross domestic product (GDP) topping $1 trillion for the first time. It surpassed Japan in 2010 to become the second largest economy in the world.

Japanese sponsors have been completely absent in the latest two tournaments in 2016 and 2020, replaced by those from China. In the tournament, three more Chinese companies expanded the sponsor team after Hisense put the first Chinese advertisement in front of football fans worldwide in 2016, which was also the first time in UEFA's 56-year history having a sponsor from the Chinese mainland.

In fact, Euro 2020 is not the first global tournament to see a dramatic shift in the origin of its sponsors. At the 2018 FIFA World Cup Russia, a third of the top sponsors came from China. Besides for China's economy surging over the two decades, with the share of global GDP growing from 3.61 percent in 2000 to 17.38 percent in 2020, other Asian major economies – excluding Japan – also experienced an expansion in the share of global GDP. However, the share of global GDP for European and North American economies shrank during the same time. ""Asia is rapidly overtaking Europe and North America in relative economic power, a trend that will continue for the next decades. A prestigious World Cup sponsorship is a sign of Asia's rising economic power,"" Kalin Anev Janse, CFO and member of the management board of the European Stability Mechanism, observed from the 2018 event.

China to fuel global sponsorship market post COVID-19 Global economies are recovering from COVID-19 at different paces, which will affect where sports sponsorships come from as well as their values, according to Nielsen Sports. China to take an increasingly prominent role in the sponsorship landscape globally, Nielsen Sports expected in a report.

The World Bank said in the latest projection that China's economic growth in 2021 would be 8.5 percent year on year, following 2 percent growth in 2020 as the only major economy seeing positive growth globally."

China's corporates have made further progress in business normalization despite lingering uncertainties, continuously recovering from the COVID shock, according to the latest China CFO survey by UBS China. Among the 531 respondents who are senior corporate executives, fewer of them reported a negative impact from the COVID-19. While there was still 11 percent who said their business has yet back to normal, the number was much lower than 48 percent in a September 2020 survey.

Fewer respondents than before delayed or lowered capital expenditure, or capex, shut down business, laid off workers or cut wages, while more chose to increase hiring and wages, adopt more automation and robotics, and push forward online business, the survey showed. The survey also showed an improved business outlook, with 66 percent of the respondents expected higher year-on-year sales in the second half of 2021. Such a positive estimation was made by only 35 percent for the second half of 2020.

Meanwhile, one-third of the executives forecast a higher profit margin. Estimations on both export and domestic orders also increased, reflecting a continued recovery in global trade and domestics consumption.

For other uncertainties cast, over such as by China-U.S. relations, respondents presented an optimistic outlook. With over a half expecting some existing additional tariffs to be rolled off and 24 percent expecting the status quo, slightly higher than the previous 21 percent. Meanwhile, the proportion reporting a negative impact from the China-U.S. trade friction dropped from 66 percent in the September survey and about 80 percent in earlier surveys to 51 percent."
476,Explainer: Why China has so many state-owned enterprises,"04:10

China, the world's second largest economy, has the largest number of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in the world – over 150,000. In many other countries, especially in the West, the number of SOEs is much smaller, normally in single digits. According to the Fortune Global 500 list 2020, 117 of the global top 500 companies are based on the Chinese mainland and 91 of those are SOEs. There are 121 companies from the United States in the top 500, but none of them are government-owned.

So, why are there so many SOEs in China? First, history. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, SOEs have played a pivotal role in the economy. The country was under a planned economy for a period of time, which meant that almost all enterprises were entirely owned and controlled by the government. Nothing changed until 1978, when China decided to reform and open up. At the time, China instituted market characteristics to its economic system, calling it a socialist market economy. Since then, more and more Chinese people have created their own businesses. Some scholars, both from China and foreign countries, have suggested privatizing all the SOEs, arguing that guaranteed government support can lead to sloppy money usage and low efficiency.

A man talking on a mobile telephone in Shenzhen, China, 1993. /CFP A man talking on a mobile telephone in Shenzhen, China, 1993. /CFP

In the late '90s, China moved to downsize SOEs with a policy called ""Grasping the large and letting the small go,"" which indicates the central government would maintain control over the larger SOEs, and the local government could restructure, privatize or just shut down the smaller ones. With SOEs also facing bankruptcy risks, China's market seemed to become more and more competitive. Some scholars, both from China and foreign countries, have suggested privatizing the SOEs, arguing that guaranteed government support can lead to low efficiency. ""The SOEs themselves are incompatible with the market economy,"" Zhang Weiying, a professor at Peking University, once told Phoenix TV. ""I still think there's only one way out for Chinese SOEs, which is to gradually privatize them.""

478,What makes China a world cryptocurrency mining hub?,"05:22

China's Inner Mongolia's recent proposal to ""clean up and shut down"" all cryptocurrency mining operations by the end of April 2021 gave the already high-flying bitcoin's prices another boost. With comparatively better investment returns than most traditional assets during the COVID-19 pandemic, Bitcoin has been under the spotlight in the financial market. A year ago, one bitcoin would cost about $6,000. However, today, its price hovers around $55,000, nine times what it was year on year, even reaching over $61,000 at one point. China is the world's largest producer of bitcoin, according to data from Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance (CCAF). Inner Mongolia accounted for 7.71 percent of the world's computing power for bitcoin between September 2019 and April 2020, even higher than the United States, which accounted for only 5.29 percent over the same period.

Greater accessibility to hardware Increasing computational difficulties for mining cryptocurrency necessitates the utilization of specialized hardware for strong computing power. For bitcoins, the hardware includes a graphics processing unit (GPU) or an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) miner designed for the sole purpose of mining. A cost structure from a CCAF report comparing Chinese and U.S. miners seems to confirm China's competitive edge in mining-machine acquisition. The report attributed China's competitive edge to the concentration of hardware manufacturers, shorter supply chains and the absence of additional overseas shipping fees.

The CCAF data showed that 52 percent of ASIC manufacturers' total sales went to Chinese miners in 2019, dwarfing other regions, while 12 percent went to the U.S. and 9 percent Canada.

Energy-hungry mining Besides capital expenditures, electricity costs comprise the lion's share of miners' operational expenditure. According to the CCAF's estimation, bitcoin mining's annualized electricity consumption is near 140 terawatt-hours, more than that of entire countries, such as Argentina and the Netherlands. Hydropower is the number one source of energy for miners worldwide, followed by coal and natural gas. Asia-Pacific miners equally rely on coal and hydropower. Renewable energy is still much less adopted as a power source."
479,What attracts companies in expanding business in B&R countries?,"China's economic transactions with countries in the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) remained robust despite the COVID-19 pandemic, with the trade volume jumping 27.5 percent year-on-year in the first half of 2021.

Country-led mega investments in building highways and power plants, as well as private investments, have both contributed in advancing cross-regional cooperation. Apart from trade in goods, companies are investing in the services sector in Belt and Road (B&R) countries.

Countries along the B&R have a strong appetite for services exports from China as they share many economic and trade ties, Zhang Jianming, chairman of Minyoun Hospitality and a member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) told CGTN on the sidelines of the China International Fair for Trade in Services (CIFTIS).

Zhang added that tourist attractions in B&R countries cater to a growing number of Chinese tourists looking for exotic beauty, and demand for business travel in these countries is also expanding.

Minyoun Hospitality, which primarily engages in the hotel business, has assets under management of 45 billion yuan ($7 billion). The group inked a deal with the Silk Road Samarkand Touristic Center at CIFTIS, providing construction technology and management services to two in-building hotels in the Silk Road Samarkand tourist complex.

Famous for its mosques and mausoleums, Samarkand is the second-largest city in Uzbekistan and serves as an important cultural site on the ancient Silk Road.

However, conducting business across borders comes with many uncertainties, Zhang noted, cautioning about the political and legal risks in expanding business overseas.

The following are excerpts from the interview, edited for brevity and clarity.

CGTN: What is the just-signed deal with Uzbekistan about?

Zhang: The deal concerns the Samarkand Hotel Cluster. We'll send personnel, and use the Minyoun brand to manage local hotels. It belongs to the category of services exports.

CGTN: Is there a great demand for services trading in BRI countries?

Zhang: Countries along the Belt and Road are very keen to import this kind of services from China because they share many economic and trade networks with China. So the BRI is also a main development focus of Minyoun.

CGTN: Is the deal denominated in RMB?

Zhang: Yes, there were options for USD-denominated transactions and RMB-denominated transactions in the signing process. We decided to trade in RMB as the currency is increasingly being used in international clearing and settlement. It's convenient, and also demonstrates our support and confidence in using RMB in settlements.

CGTN: How long will it take the sector to recover to pre-pandemic levels?

Zhang: In the three months of May, June and July this year, hotels in our operation area returned to the level of 2019. But it soon fell again because of the resurgence of cases, so we can't make a specific prediction on when we'll fully recover. But we're confident that with China's stringent pandemic control effort, it will take a relatively short time to recover. Also, the ""retaliatory consumption"" after the pandemic will positively influence the industry.

480,Interview: How Lenovo handles global supply crunch amid the pandemic,"The COVID-19 pandemic has wreaked havoc on world trade and led to a shortage of components, creating trouble for manufactures across the globe. Personal computer makers have been scrambling to secure supplies to meet the surge in demand as remote work and education got a massive boost during the pandemic.

The world's top PC maker, Lenovo managed to produce more than 20 million computers for the past three quarters in a row. While major competitors Dell and HP recently reported quarterly net income growth of 42 percent and 51 percent, respectively, Lenovo's net income surged 119 percent for its latest quarter.

Guan Wei, senior vice president of Lenovo and head of its global supply chain, told CGTN that its hybrid supply chain model and arrangement before the pandemic has helped it through the storm. This model differs from its main competitors, which rely on contract manufactures.

""Other PC makers often hire other parties to design and produce computers for them and sell the products under their own brands,"" Guan Wei told CGTN on the sidelines of the 2021 China International Fair for Trade in Services. He said that Lenovo does this as well as in-house manufacturing.

HP is approaching component suppliers instead of counting on contract manufacturers, the company's Chief Executive Officer Enrique Lores noted as the company released a quarterly earnings report in August.

Lores added that HP is altering chip designs so that they can be applied to multiple hardware models.

Guan admitted that a severe chip shortage is going on for the computer manufacturing industries, which also affects Lenovo. But the company has been effectively minimizing the impact.

""We had more than 38 million laptops made in LCFC last year, which makes up for about 65 percent of Lenovo's global sales,"" said Guan.

He added Lenovo directly deals with many of the components' supplier to the plant which gives it a priority in securing supplies when encounters disruptions.

LCFC (Hefei) Electronic Technology, set up in east China's Anhui Province a decade ago, serves as Lenovo's largest personal computer manufacturing base.

Guan said that Lenovo's arrangements before the pandemic also helped. It has in 2019 designated a committee to assess supply chain risks and launched the digital transformation in 2017.

'Dual circulation'

""We make use of our global resources, such as research and development, design, procurement, but when it comes down to manufacturing, we still focus on China,"" said Guan.

Lenovo makes 90 percent of its products in China and exports some of those to overseas markets. Take the Brazilian market for an example, the company would ship the made-in-China components to its Brazilian factory for assembly and localization in avoidance of paying much higher tariffs on end products.

Commenting on China's manufacturing industry, Guan cautioned that the sector is huge but still not very strong.

He added that China's intelligent manufacturing, rather than pure mass production, will develop gradually, accompanied by the country's 'dual circulation' strategy.

The strategy refers to an economic development pattern that takes domestic development as the mainstay, with domestic and international development reinforcing each other.

Guan said that Lenovo has actually been implementing this strategy in a few aspects for some time and will continue to follow this path.

Going forward, Guan said the company aims to ""excel"" the practice of intelligent manufacturing in China before extending it to overseas factories."
481,Xpeng: China's EV industry bracing for a knockout round,"Thousands of electric vehicle makers have sprung up in the past few years in China, the world's largest market for this new energy trend.

Competition is tough.

Most of these start-ups will die eventually, and only a few will survive, according to He Xiaopeng, the chairman and CEO of one of China's top EV makers, Xpeng. To survive, the company is betting on smart technologies such as autopilot, which He believes will provide it with an edge to eventually conquer the domestic and international markets.

It's a crucial period for the 7-year-old EV maker. With fast-growing deliveries, the company's gross margins reached 11.2 percent for the first quarter, compared with negative 4.8 percent for the same period in 2020 and 7.4 percent in Q4 last year. The company delivered 13,340 cars in the first quarter, representing an increase of 487.4 percent from the same period the previous year.

However, compared to other homegrown EV start-ups, like NIO and Li Auto, Xpeng's deliveries and gross margins are lagging behind.

NIO delivered 20,060 cars in the first quarter, with gross margin standing at 19.5 percent. Li Auto delivered 12,579 cars in the same period, slightly lower than Xpeng, but its gross margin was higher, standing at 17.3 percent, due to a higher product price.

The three companies, all listed in the U.S., are dubbed China's home-grown challengers to Tesla. But currently, Tesla still dominates in China in terms of market share and deliveries. Tesla delivered 184,800 cars in China in the same period.

But Xpeng's chairman and CEO says he is not sweating over profit margin. He says he is content with the current performance and believes that the long-term goal is more important.

""Some of our peer companies have really good gross margins, it's mainly because they target high-end customers, and their scale will run into a bottleneck in a few years,"" said He.

He also told CGTN the company's autopilot software earned over 80 million yuan ($12.38 million) last year, which is an exciting trend for the Xpeng. If the software has better gross margins, as the trend catches up the company will create new products and business systems.

The company launched the Navigation Guided Pilot (NGP) in January. The feature allows drivers to automatically change lanes and overtake cars as well as enter and exit highways. The NGP is a challenge to Tesla's autopilot feature and Nio's system NIO Pilot.

The global semiconductor shortage has been wreaking havoc on the global car industry since last year, cutting down the manufacturing capabilities of the automobile sector across the world. However, He believes in the long term, it's good for China as it will prompt the country to ramp up chip manufacturing.

He also clarified rumors that Xpeng is developing in-house chips. ""We are looking at many chip-related systems, but right now, we are still cooperating with our chip suppliers,"" he said.

China is currently the largest EV market and manufacturer in the world. Full-year EV sales could reach 2.4 million this year in China, according to a forecast by the China Passenger Car Association. Meanwhile, nearly half of the world’s plug-in electric car production and 90 percent of heavy-duty electric vehicle production was in China in 2020, according to The International Council on Clean Transportation. Some industry insiders are concerned about whether an EV bubble is building. ""As long as there is demand, it's not a bubble,"" said He.

But He also warned the competition would become fierce in the next three to five years. The number of EV companies will be whittled down, with just a few left standing.

He Xiaopeng is the co-founder of Xpeng. He made his initial fortune by founding the browser UCWeb, which was sold to Alibaba in 2014. In the same year, the technocrat co-founded Xpeng's start-up team. A year later, the company was launched in southern China's Guangzhou.

Xpeng listed its shares on the New York Stock Exchange in August 2020. Seeking more capital to ramp up production and to hedge against the risks posed by the geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and China, Xpeng returned home and finished the dual primary listing on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in July and raised $1.8 billion in the IPO. Company executives also revealed the firm will consider listing on the A-share market on the Chinese mainland in the future.

The following excerpts from an interview with He have been edited for clarity and brevity.

CGTN: How has the global chip shortage affected Xpeng?

He: The chip shortage is influencing car manufacturers around the world, and Xpeng is no exception. We are doing a lot of work and communication every week to minimize the influence. I think the chip shortage will go on for months, but I think it won't have that obvious impact in the long term.

The chip shortage will cause a big blow to China's automobile industry. It means we need to have a backup in addition to the chips we have. It will also prompt China to establish its chip system. So in the long term, the recent chip shortage will benefit China's development.

CGTN: Does Xpeng have plans to develop chips in-house?

He: We are looking at many chip-related systems, but right now, we are still cooperating with all of our chip suppliers and reach a win-win.

CGTN: Xpeng achieved positive gross margins for the first time in 2020, but still lower than peer companies, why?

He: You can see that Xpeng's goal is to make mid-to-high-end cars. Our cars' prices are between 150,000 to 400,000 yuan. Our sales numbers allowed us to reach a gross margin of more than 10 percent with this price range; it's already pretty good.

We can see that most car-related companies in China have a gross margin of 10 to 20 percent. Still, their scale is a lot bigger than Xpeng, so we are confident that our scale will grow tremendously after the market improves, and our gross margin rate will also improve.

Some of our peer car companies have really good gross margins, it's mainly because they target high-end customers, but their scale will run into a bottleneck in a few years; we are observing it. So it doesn't matter who has a better gross margin first. What's important is the long-term goal.

We don't pursue the whole company's good profit. Still, we care about our products' gross margin, including both hardware and software gross margin.

Last season's financial report showed that our autopilot software earned over 80 million yuan for the first time. This product's gross margin is rather good. So I think this trend is just beginning. The software gradually has better gross margins. As the trend progresses, I think it will create brand new products and business systems.

CGTN: Is 2021 a crucial year for Xpeng to break even?

He: I don't think so. The most important things are long-term development as well as technological and product innovation.

Next is expanding the scale. Exactly how big of the scale will bring profit? Most of the time it's determined by the companies themselves. For example, if the R&D investment is low, then the company will profit early. But for us, if we want to compete globally, R&D is indispensable. This year we will more than double what we invested in R&D last year, and I think we will also invest a lot next year. The R&D investment is for 2025, when the fight turns from qualification to the knockout round. That's what we are focusing on.

CGTN: Recently, electric car companies such as Tesla were involved in many incidents, such as violating users' data privacy and alleged brake malfunction. How does that influence the electric car industry?

He: It will create some concerns for potential customers over electric cars. They will have some confusion. But I think as time goes by, the customers will soon regain their confidence.

CGTN: Some analysts think China's electric car industry is developing too fast, which might generate a big bubble. What's your take on that?

He: I think as long as there is demand in the market, it's not a bubble.

In the following five to 10 years, we will enter an active mobile internet era, which means that the mobile devices will move by themselves. Cars are among them.

It's a combination between hardware, software, internet operation and offline service scenarios. It's a massive market. But in the next three to five years, things might look like what happened to the first generation of Chinese smart car start-ups. The number of electric car companies goes from hundreds to just a few. I think it's a painful, yet also a happy process.

CGTN: Many internet giants are tossing their hats into the electric car industry. How will that influence Xpeng?

He: Competing with strong competitors around the world will make you stronger. Eventually, in the global market, there will only be several innovative car companies left. Like in this year's smartphone market, each player has a sizeable portion, and they take the major part of the market.

In terms of the supply chain and R&D system, with more talents joining the industry, they will become the foundation of the bigger talent pool in the future. To customers, this means that completely innovative smart electric cars will arrive sooner. I think it's the process of multi-party operation.

CGTN: Xpeng is a newcomer to the car industry. The brand's history and recognition are lacking. Will that present challenges to Xpeng's domestic and overseas development?

He: You see, there are many new consumer brands in China. Xpeng now has tied its brands with smartness. I think it's great.

Most Chinese carmakers are not putting their brands in the overseas market, especially to the consumer's market, the ultimate customer's market. To us, it's a zero to one process. During this process, it's who has the best technology and the best innovation has the biggest value. We are not worried. We are delighted to be able to compete in this completely new lane.

CGTN: Xpeng's sales numbers have been climbing since the end of last year. Will that drive up Xpeng's stock price?

He: I think to run a company is to look at the long-term development, and the stock market and secondary market fluctuations are short-term.

I basically don't look at the secondary market. As the founder of a company, I need to think about long-term development, do things well step by step. That's the most important thing. So we wouldn't make certain moves just for short-term gains.

482,How will China Unicom cope with heated competition in 5G application?,"Editor's note: The 2021 Boao Forum for Asia is held from April 18 to 21 in Boao, Hainan Province. Over 150 elite entrepreneurs from various business circles around the world will join government officials and scholars to discuss Asian economic cooperation and other issues. CGTN's Boss Talk series brings you special reports of industry representatives' views on technology, healthcare, manufacturing and recycling business outlook in a post-COVID-19 era.

China is undoubtedly leading the world in 5G development. More than 600,000 5G base stations were built and put into operation by the end of 2020, and the country is planning to build another 600,000 5G base stations this year, expanding coverage in more major cities. Among the top three 5G equipment providers, two of them are from China.

What does this mean? To ordinary users, it may just mean faster speed bands, but to industry insiders, the significant influence of 5G lies in its ability of reimagining and upgrading traditional industries, being able to process and make use of the huge amount of data we are generating every day, building a new pattern of development and eventually change our society.

But China's 5G efforts are not unhindered. The cost of 5G terminals and the electricity bill of running those terminals are much higher than that of 4G. On top of that, the sporadic bans issued against China's 5G manufacturers, such as Huawei and ZTE, by countries buying into the U.S.' conspiracy theory that China's 5G equipment could be used for espionage also chipped the country's share in the global 5G market.

Zhang Yunyong, general manager of the product department at China Unicom, one of China's big three telecom operators, told CGTN's Zhou Yiqiu that it's important for China's 5G development not to be discouraged by the turbulent global environment and the chip ban from the U.S. He believes that China's increased support for basic science education and research and development industries will eventually enable the industry to get through the tough time.

The following excerpts from the interview have been edited for clarity and brevity.

CGTN: What difficulties did you face and what experience have you gained in the construction of 5G infrastructure?

Zhang: We can see 5G as a high-speed road: it must be wider, more three-dimensional, more intelligent, more convenient and open to strengthening our real economy, sharing economy and digital economy. However, the construction of 5G is not that smooth. The cost is high, and the coverage of 5G is not as wide as 4G. The electricity charge is also very high.

Joint construction and sharing is our main experience. China Unicom and China Telecom have taken the lead in jointly building and sharing 5G, cutting nearly half of construction cost and saving about 100 billion yuan every year. It might save 500 billion yuan if we continue in the future. This is an important experience.

Secondly, we combined China Unicom's 100 MHz 5G frequency with China Telecom's 100 MHz frequency into 200 MHz frequency to lower the cost. In other words, the high-speed road is wider, which enabled us to go faster.

CGTN: How do you see the relationship between 5G and satellite internet and 6G proposed by the U.S.?

Zhang: Firstly, it's possible to embrace these new technologies in the future, such as some good features of 6G, and the addition of satellite internet for 5G construction. But it is too early to say that. At present, we need to concentrate on the construction and development of 5G.

There are four main 5G manufacturers in the world, China's Huawei and ZTE account for two of them. Moreover, Huawei and ZTE's patents account for one-third of the world's 5G industry.

So don't be disturbed by outside voices, they may even be voices from the U.S. looking to disrupt China's 5G.

CGTN: How can 5G go global for cooperation and exchanges?

Zhang: At present, there are two major situations. Firstly, the United States and the Five Eyes Alliance are trying to curb some Chinese enterprises like Huawei and ZTE.

Secondly, we have also developed a double-circulation pattern in which inner circulation predominates. Relying on the Belt and Road Initiative, we are building the Digital Silk Road. We are promoting 5G, high-speed railway and intelligent devices along the Belt and Road countries.

We will help China's 5G, high-speed railway and intelligent devices go abroad together to build a community with a shared future for mankind. For example, we are using these methods to shorten the digital gap between us and Africa, so they can enjoy the benefits of 5G.

I am also a member of the China-Africa Friendship Group of the CPPCC National Committee, and I have conducted standard cooperation and talent cooperation with them many times.

In addition to serving these countries, Chinese companies also have a strategy when going abroad. They will bring their communication services, 5G services, and 5G operation wherever they go.

Therefore, on the one hand, 5G enables high-quality development for these countries; on the other hand, 5G also expands production capacity and monetizes through digital autonomy.

CGTN: What do you think 5G will bring to human society？

Zhang: It's a good question. It is also a vision we had at the early stage of 5G development: 4G changed life, and 5G will change society.

Everyone in society can experience intelligence. For example, many people who can't drive can still use autonomous vehicles. Smart homes provide comfort in our everyday life. For instance, intelligent devices are installed in the doorbell and the kitchen, which makes people yearn for more. Medical care for the elderly and education for kids used to be a problem, it may be relieved now.

Governance is more important. Smart cities and digital governments built by 5G will enable more data operations and help the public to avoid detours. Also, 5G is applied to environment monitoring and air pollution prevention. 5G and the digital economy have increased government efficiency.

And the key is data, which is the most important factor for the flow of the digital economy and a 5G-enabled society. The future will be a data society."

The European Commission postponed its free trade negotiations with Australia for a month, according to an EU official. /Getty Images

The European Commission has postponed its free trade negotiations with Australia for a month, a spokesperson of the European Union (EU) executive said on Friday.

The decision came on the heels of a dispute between the two sides over the Australian government's decision to cancel a multibillion-euro submarine deal with France and sign an agreement instead with the United States (U.S.) and the United Kingdom (UK).

""The next round of negotiations has been postponed for a month. Substance prevails over speed when it comes to negotiations and this extra month will allow us to prepare better for the next round,"" the European Commission's spokesperson in charge of trade, Miriam Garcia Ferrer, said at a news conference, adding that the decision was taken ""a few days ago"".

Asked whether it was the EU's retaliation against Australia, the Commission's chief spokesperson Eric Mamer replied: ""The EU is not in the business of punishing anybody. Australia is a partner of the European Union. We have ongoing trade negotiations, which are very specific beasts. The substance of the negotiation is one that involves a lot more effort, so it is not unusual that such decisions are taken.""

Garcia Ferrer insisted that the postponement did not mean the end of negotiations, adding that there were several pending issues, such as market access, rules of origin, intellectual property, public procurement and sustainable development.

""There is quite a lot of work that needs to be done in those areas so that's why we need some more time to reflect on the next stage,"" she said.

In 2016, Australia signed the 90-billion-Australian-dollar (65.4 billion U.S. dollars) deal with the French majority state-owned Naval Group on the purchase of 12 conventional diesel-electric submarines. But Australia canceled the deal last month as part of an alliance with the U.S. and the UK that will give Australia at least eight nuclear-powered submarines."
484,Energy prices send eurozone inflation to 13-year high,"Eurozone consumer prices rose at their fastest pace since 2008 in September as energy costs skyrocketed, official data showed on Friday.

Eurostat, the EU's official statistics agency, said eurozone inflation reached 3.4 percent on an annualized basis, with energy prices increasing by 17.4 percent.

The rise in costs was far above the 2.0 percent target at the European Central Bank and will raise pressure on EU governments to take measures to ease the energy cost burden.

ECB President Christine Lagarde insists that high inflation remains a temporary phenomenon linked to the coronavirus pandemic that has upset supply chains and disrupted the energy market.

But Eurostat said core inflation, which strips out energy and other items, stood at 1.9 percent, up from 1.6 percent a month earlier.

Energy prices are becoming a political flashpoint in Europe, with countries considering a wide range of emergency plans to lower the prices for consumers.

Brussels is preparing a series of short-term measures such as cutting value-added tax and excises on energy, in hopes of preserving commitments for more renewable energy sources."
485,From eradicating extreme poverty to aiming for common prosperity,"Tourists admiring the flower arrangement in Tiananmen Square, September 30, Beijing. /CFP Tourists admiring the flower arrangement in Tiananmen Square, September 30, Beijing. /CFP

Today marks the 72nd anniversary since the People's Republic of China was founded. China has achieved a historic transformation since then. It has risen from a poor country with national GDP of 67.9 billion yuan ($10.5 billion) and per capita GDP of less than $100 in 1952 to an upper-middle-income status with national GDP of 101.6 trillion yuan ($15.77 trillion), and per capita GDP of over $10,000 last year. Now the world's second-largest economy accounts for over 17 percent of global GDP and contributes more than 30 percent of global economic growth, according to statistics from the National Bureau of Statistics. This economic power has brought significant changes to ordinary Chinese people's lives. Millions have been lifted out of poverty, the standard of living has improved in all respects, and the country has the largest middle class, not only fueling the growth of China but also the world. From the reform and opening-up that started in 1978 to 2020, some 770 million people have been lifted out of poverty, accounting for over 70 percent of the global poverty reduction in the same period. Meanwhile, the country has a middle-income group of over 400 million people, and this number keeps expanding, offering a supersized market that is growing faster than any other place in the world.

All of the above achievements come as the result of two of China's national goals over decades – eradicating extreme poverty and achieving a moderately prosperous society. Eradication of extreme poverty in China China has managed to eradicate extreme poverty, announced Chinese President Xi Jinping in February this year in Beijing. The Communist Party of China (CPC) has been working to improve people's livelihoods since its foundation, with more than 10 million impoverished people lifted out of poverty on average each year since the 18th National Congress of the CPC in 2012. The final 98.99 million impoverished rural residents living under the current poverty line were lifted out of poverty by the end of 2020. All the 832 impoverished counties and 128,000 impoverished villages have been removed from the poverty list. In total, 770 million rural residents have shaken off poverty since the beginning of reform and opening-up over 40 years ago, when calculated as per the current poverty line.

The country invested nearly 1.6 trillion yuan ($246 billion) in poverty alleviation and adopted a targeted poverty alleviation strategy through development. China met the poverty eradication target set in the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development 10 years ahead of schedule, and according to the World Bank's international poverty line, the number of Chinese people lifted out of poverty over the past 40 years accounts for more than 70 percent of the global total. China's road to all-round moderate prosperity President Xi Jinping said in his speech at the national commendation that shaking off poverty is not the finish line, but the starting point of a new life and new endeavor. While eradicating extreme poverty, China has been aiming for a higher goal – building a moderately prosperous society in all respects. A moderately prosperous society, or Xiaokang society in Chinese, refers to a state in the traditional Confucian sense in which everyone is adequately provided for, despite imperfections. The ""moderately prosperous"" concept was first proposed by the late leader Deng Xiaoping in 1979. The goal was then formalized at the 18th National Congress of the CPC in 2012, where it stated that by 2020, the GDP and the national income per capita, among other things, should be doubled compared to the 2010 level. To realize GDP growth is not the sole goal. All-round development in economic, political, cultural, education, social equity areas as well as in eco-environmental fields is essential to moderate prosperity. After decades of endeavor, China completed the goal of building a moderately prosperous society in all respects, announced President Xi Jinping in Beijing, while delivering an important speech in July this year at the grand gathering to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the founding of the CPC. China apparently has met the GDP growth goal according to the plans of achieving a moderately prosperous society. China's nominal GDP per capita increased from $4,550 in 2010 to $10,500 in 2020, an average annualized growth rate of 8.7 percent. In terms of all-round development, China has established the world's largest education system, spanning preschool, primary, secondary, and higher education. The number of medical and health institutions has risen from 170,000 in 1978 to 1,023,000, and life expectancy has increased to 77.3 years.

In addition, China has set up a system of eco-environmental protection zones, safeguarding its biodiversity with nature reserves at different levels and of various types now covering 18 percent of the country's landmass."

U.S. President Joe Biden on Thursday signed a stopgap bill passed earlier by Congress ahead of a midnight deadline to avoid forcing the U.S. government to shut down due to lack of funding.

The House of Representatives voted by 254 votes to 175 to keep the lights on for another two months with a resolution that had already advanced comfortably from the Senate with a vote of 65-35.

The short-term spending bill will fund the federal government through December 3.

""There's so much more to do. But the passage of this bill reminds us that bipartisan work is possible and it gives us time to pass longer-term funding to keep our government running and delivering for the American people,"" Biden said in a statement.

The rare example of bipartisan cooperation comes with Democratic leaders trying to hammer out a deal over Biden's faltering $3.5 trillion social spending package, which has no Republican support, and a bipartisan $1 trillion infrastructure bill.

In yet another high-stakes battle, congressional Democrats and Republicans continued brawling over giving the Treasury Department additional borrowing authority beyond the current statutory limit of $28.4 trillion.

A historic U.S. debt default could occur around October 18, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has estimated, if Congress fails to act.

Republicans want no part of the debt limit increase, saying it is Democrats' problem since they control Congress and the White House. Democrats note that about $5 trillion of the nation's debt is the result of tax cuts and spending passed during Republican Donald Trump's presidency.

The House approved a bill late on Wednesday suspending the debt limit through December 2022. The Senate could vote on it ""as early as next week,"" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said, but Republicans are expected to block it again.

Yellen said on Thursday it would be a ""catastrophe"" if Congress does not raise the debt ceiling. The uncertainty is starting to filter into financial markets, although few believe the nation will ultimately default.

487,UK fuel crisis cuts traffic to lowest since lockdown,"Britain's gas station crisis cut road traffic volumes to the lowest level since the COVID-19 lockdowns, data showed on Thursday, indicating that fuel pump chaos across the land may hinder the recovery of the world's fifth largest economy.

In a chaotic week where fights broke out at gas stations and people filled up old water bottles with petrol, British ministers have repeatedly said the crisis is easing, though they ordered soldiers on Wednesday to start driving fuel tankers.

""That crisis is now absolutely something which is back under control,"" Chief Secretary to the Treasury Simon Clarke said.

Reuters reporters visited 10 petrol stations in London and surrounding areas on Thursday. Three were open. A line of dozens of drivers snaked back from one of the open stations with staff attempting to direct the queue.

Transport ministry data indicated that motor traffic had decreased by 6 percentage points on Monday from the previous week to the lowest volume on a non-holiday Monday since July 12. England ended COVID restrictions on July 19.

Car and light commercial vehicle traffic fell the most, the data showed, with heavy goods vehicle traffic down by 3 percentage points.

The disruption, caused mainly by an acute shortage of truck drivers, and the spike in prices it is expected to fuel, threaten to undermine Britain's economic growth, projected at 7 percent this year.

Data released by the Office for National Statistics on Thursday showed the economy grew by more than previously thought in the April-June period before what looked like a sharp slowdown more recently as post-lockdown bottlenecks, including the shortage of truck drivers, mount.

The Petrol Retailers Association (PRA), which represents independent retailers who account for about two-thirds of all the 8,380 UK filling stations, said on Wednesday that 27 percent of members reported being out of fuel and it expected the situation to further improve in the next 24 hours.

Brexit

The gas station crisis has provoked scorn in some European capitals, with senior politicians suggesting Britain's trucker shortage was a clear consequence of its 2016 referendum decision to leave the European Union.

British ministers have repeatedly denied Brexit played a role, though tens of thousands of EU truckers left during the Brexit maelstrom. Another factor has been the COVID lockdowns, which prevented tens of thousands of trucker tests.

Asked if Britain would be in a better position had it not left the EU single market, Clarke said: ""I really don't accept that.""

""The idea that this is about Brexit is to try and take us back into what is really I'm afraid quite a negative conversation around opportunities foregone,"" he said.

""If you look at the situation in Germany, if you look at the situation in Poland, if you look at the situation in France, they share these problems too.""

To tackle the shortage of drivers, the government has been forced to bring in measures it had previously ruled out, such as issuing temporary visas to 5,000 foreign drivers."
488,Expert says China's carbon-emission goals can't be reached overnight,"More than a dozen Chinese provinces and municipalities announced some form of power cut this month, as strong demand, on top of a shortage of supply, and more restricted emission standards, have pushed the price of coal to record highs.

Energy providers aren't able to keep up as demand increases, and the price of coal isn't helping.

""The coal price as I know, per tonne, reached 1,600 yuan ($247.5), that is three times, a lot more,"" said Liu Zhiqin, senior researcher at Renmin University of China's Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies.

There's a gap between supply and demand, said Chai Qimin, director of strategy and planning at the National Center for Climate Change Strategy and International Cooperation. ""In the first half of 2021, we can see electricity [demand] increases by 14 percent, but the production of electricity only increases around 10 percent.""

Many businesses are struggling to cope with the situation. The outages come as companies are also having to incorporate energy-saving measures, and trying to reduce their carbon emissions. This has had a knock-on effect on production. One factory in east China's Zhejiang Province has seen its production levels halve, and it's not alone.

Wang Zehui, manager of Knitted Apparel Industrial Park in Yiwu City, Zhejiang Province, said, ""The Stocking Dyeing Factory, which we cooperate with, is also in shutdown. Its operations have been halted for four days, and may last till the end of this month.""

China's State Grid has promised to meet people's basic energy needs and the country's top economic planner, the National Development and Reform Commission, said it will guarantee home heating for the winter.

China has vowed to reach carbon emission peak by 2030 and be a carbon-neutral country by 2060, while pushing reforms by promoting green and low-carbon energy. The dual carbon goals are not going to be easy to meet.

""The carbon emission [control] is national strategy, all entrepreneurs and regions should pay great attention to support national strategy,"" Liu said, stressing that it is not ""a hurried step.""

He added it means the strategy needs to be done in a rational, reasonable and well-planned manner, ""not in a rush, not in one day, one night to overcome carbon emissions.""

As factories try to meet the emission standards, it will take time to renovate and innovate in order to improve their efficiency and system, Liu said.

Bumps along the road were always likely and expected, but experts said getting over problems such as this energy crunch in a sustainable way can only smooth the way ahead."
489,Bonds' move will anchor sentiment in Q4 as Fed nears taper,"Editor's note: Jimmy Zhu is chief strategist at Singapore-based Fullerton Research. The article reflects the author's opinion, and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

After the Fed said it would taper its quantitative easing within the year, bond markets are seen selling pressure again as yield moves higher. Moving into the final quarter of the year, global investors are expected to pay more attention to bonds' direction, which is one of the most sensitive markets to the Fed's policy outlook.

If history is a reliable guide, the global financial market may experience more volatility in the coming months, as the bond yield may have more scope to climb higher. In May 2013, the Fed's ex-chief Ben Bernanke mentioned tapering for the first time, and the U.S. 10-year government bond yield rallied over 100 basis points (bps) in the next three months. But so far, the reaction in bonds have been quite limited, suggesting further rising in yield can't be ruled out. As of September 30, the U.S. 10-year government bonds yield has gained around 20 bps to 1.50 percent since the FOMC September meeting.

The 10-year government bond yield also reflects the markets' expectations on the inflation outlook. In May 2013, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE), rose 1.4 percent from a year ago, while the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield traded around 1.7 percent. Data showed the average spread between the 10-year bond yield and core PCE over the last decade standing at 32 bps.

However, the current gap between the two indicators is much wider, with the latest reading for core PCE standing at 3.60 percent, way above the current 10-year bond yield at 1.50 percent. The overall commodity prices are still rising and approaching the highest levels in seven years, suggesting the signs of inflation to ease remain unseen. If the high inflation rate persists, it's reasonable for the traders to expect the gains in bond yield to be far from over.

Since COVID-19 has cast a shadow globally since March 2020, the correlation between the U.S. 10-year bond yield and Nasdaq Composite Index stands at 0.8 percent. Having that said, this correlation analysis shows that any sharp gains in bond yield will hit those technology stocks badly, and a sell-off in these stocks will easily spread the negative sentiment into the broader market.

The 10 biggest stocks on the S&P 500 make up around 30 percent of the index's market value, and eight of these 10 companies belong in the technology sector. Thus, the moves in technology stocks, especially for those big ones, are often regarded as synonymous with the market as a whole. Before the global stocks rebound in a more broad base, investors need to be comfortable with the upcoming Fed tightening cycle, and that really depends on the economic activities.

The previous Fed's tightening cycle, which was between 2015-2018, didn't bring much panic into the financial market. Strong economic activities in that period played a large role to counter the side effect from financial tightening. For example, the U.S. manufacturing PMI has been holding a firm uptrend in those years, and S&P 500 index rose around 22 percent, even with the Fed policy rate hiked by over 200 bps.

But the economic conditions are very different to the previous Fed's tightening cycle. The U.S. ISM manufacturing PMI showed signs of peaking in March this year. Since then, the PMI readings have been slowing down. Furthermore, the latest consumer confidence index slumped to the lowest level since 2011, reflecting the ongoing worries on coronavirus spreading and persistent rising inflation. If the Fed finally starts to taper later in the year, as is the current plan, some investors may question whether the current economic conditions are solid enough without the ultra-monetary policy, and this will bring increasing volatility into financial markets from time to time.

Dollar may further gain in Q4

Recent gains in the dollar are also partly contributed by the higher bonds yield. The dollar index climbed above 94 this week, the highest level since November last year. The value of dollar index has been largely suppressed since March 2020 after the Fed injected trillions of cash into the U.S. financial system. But now, less accommodating Fed policy may offer some support to the dollar.

The dollar index started rebounding in early September, after Fed chair Jerome Powell said the Fed may start to provide less monetary policy support within the year at the virtual Jackson Hole meeting. Meanwhile, the U.S. two-year government bond yield, which is always highly sensitive to the Fed's policy outlook, rapidly rose as well. Once the Fed officially starts the tapering program, we expect the two-year bond yield to move toward 0.5 percent, 20 bps higher than the current level.

Further appreciation in the dollar is highly likely amid the rising shorter tenor bond yield. For now, the Fed may be forced to withdraw some of the stimulus due to persistent high inflation, so slowing economic activities will have limited impact on the Fed's upcoming policy, at least for the coming quarter."
490,China's factory activity contracts in September due to higher prices,"The figure was below Reuters' forecast of 50.1, but better than Nomura's prediction of 47. Nomura said in a report Monday that measures to reduce energy intensity taken in some key economic powerhouses like Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Guangdong provinces would very likely dent September's PMI.

A reading above 50 indicates expansion in activities, while a reading below that mark reflects contraction.

China's official Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), a key gauge of manufacturing activities, slipped to 49.6 in September due to high raw material prices and demand slowdown, data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed Thursday.

Both the supply and demand sides slowed in September. The production index and the new order index were 49.5 percent and 49.3 percent, respectively, down 1.4 and 0.3 percentage points from the previous month. The new order index, especially, slipped to contraction for two consecutive months, reflecting the overall slowdown of manufacturing activities and market demand, said Zhao Qinghe, a senior statistician with the NBS.

Meanwhile, the purchase price index and factory gate price index of major raw materials were 63.5 percent and 56.4 percent, respectively, 2.2 and 3.0 percentage points higher than the previous month and a four-month high, Zhao said.

The price index for petroleum, coal and other fuel processing, chemical raw materials and products and non-metallic mineral products were all above 69.0 percent, Zhao added.

By firm size, the PMI for large enterprises surveyed was 50.4 percent, slightly higher than the 50.3 percent last month. Meanwhile, small and medium-sized enterprises edged down to 47.5 percent and 49.7 percent, 0.7 and 1.5 percentage points lower than last month, respectively.

Service activity expands

China's official non-manufacturing PMI, which includes services and construction activities, surged to 53.2 from 47.5 in August.

The business activity indexes of railway, air, accommodation, catering, ecological protection and environmental governance that were more severely affected by the epidemic last month all rebounded in September, Zhao said.

The PMI for construction activities came in at 57.5 percent, 3.0 percentage points lower than last month. The labor demand of construction enterprises continued to increase this month.

The September composite PMI, which includes both manufacturing and services activity, stood at 51.7 versus 48.9 in August.

Surging coal prices and coal shortages, coupled with power consumption control targets, have led to the recent power outages in parts of the country, which have affected residents and factories.

China has promised to peak its carbon dioxide emissions by 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060.

493,Start-ups compete for $155k prize in tech innovation competition,"Who will be the next unicorn? Hundreds of tech start-ups competed for a share of 1 million yuan ($155,000) in prize money for innovation at the Zhongguancun International Frontline Technology Innovation Competition held over the past week.

The start-ups came from a range of sectors, including biomedicine, artificial intelligence, big data and cloud service.

Beijing Intelligent Nanomedicine Biotechnology is commercializing intelligent nanorods for medical use. They won the first prize in the biomedical branch. They will compete in December for the final contest with prize winners from 11 other branches.

""We joined this competition hoping to get good quality funding and policy support. We also hope we can get guidelines from industry experts,"" said Shi Quanwei, general manager of Beijing Intelligent Nanomedicine Biotech.

Beijing's municipal government has hosted the competition since July, which will select winners from 12 branches to compete in the final contest in December. Two branch winners in biomedicine and integrated circuit were announced at the Zhongguancun Forum on September 28. The final top three winners will be announced in December and will share a cash prize of 1 million yuan. Besides, the top three start-ups in each of the 12 branches will be reviewed by the experts, and if they pass the review, they will also qualify for 5 million yuan (about $770,000) in funding over the next three years for development.

For most start-ups, the pain point is raising financing for their development. To solve this problem, the host also built a finance service platform to help participant companies to get funding. This will also help start-ups connect with investors and industry experts.

""We want to attract good start-ups to move into our frontline technology innovation center. We will provide the funding, property, personnel training and policy support. By doing this we want to build Beijing into an innovation center,"" said Liu Hang, secondary inspector of the Zhongguancun Administrative Committee.

The Zhongguancun International Frontline Technology Innovation Competition was established in 2017 and is open to global start-ups. Some 4,000 companies have taken part since its creation, 39 of which have developed into unicorns and seven have successfully had initial public offerings overseas."
494,China pledges to ensure power supply in the winter season,"China's top economic planner on Wednesday vowed to ensure a stable power supply for residential use during the winter season in a response to a recent power outage in parts of the country.

The recent power outage has affected residents and factories in northeastern China, triggering fears of a sustained power crunch that will hurt the heating supply as winter draws close to the country's coldest region.

The National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) noted that it will work closely with relevant departments to tilt resources to northeastern China and go all out to ensure stable energy operations in the region.

The NDRC said that residential power generation demand would be fully guaranteed, adding that residential use only takes up a fraction of the total power supply.

The residential electricity consumption accounts for less than 20 percent of the total usage, and residential gas consumption accounts for less than half of the total gas usage, the NDRC data showed.

The NDRC vowed to take measures in guaranteeing supply, including increase coal imports in an orderly manner, increase domestic natural gas production, and make use of medium- and long-term thermal coal contracts.

It also called on strictly curbing high energy consumption and heavy pollution by industries."

China's outward foreign direct investment (ODI) grew to $153.71 billion in 2020, ranking first globally for the first time, a report showed Wednesday.

The ODI growth rate went up by 12.3 percent year on year in 2020, a large reverse from a contraction of 4.3 percent in 2019.

China's ODI amounting to $2.58 trillion at the end of 2020 remained the third largest in the world, following the United States ($8.13 trillion) and the Netherlands ($3.8 trillion), said the Annual Statistical Communiqué of China's Outward Foreign Direct Investment 2020, jointly issued by the Ministry of Commerce, the National Bureau of Statistics and the State Administration of Foreign Exchange.

China's influence in global foreign direct investment continues to expand. The flow of China's ODI accounted for more than 10 percent of the world for five consecutive years, the report said.

As of the end of last year, 280,000 Chinese local investors invested 45,000 enterprises spread in 189 countries, with total assets mounting $7.9 trillion.

In 2020, China's ODI covered 18 industrial sectors. Four major industries, including leasing and commercial services, manufacturing, wholesale and retails, and finance, were the destinations for about 70 percent of the ODI flow.

Meanwhile, China's ODI also helped to drive the country's exports by $173.7 billion, accounting for 6.7 percent of the total exports of goods.

Last year, Chinese-invested enterprises achieved sales revenue of $2.4 trillion, contributed a total of $44.5 billion to the host countries' tax revenue, and hired 2.19 million foreign employees, who accounted for over 60 percent of the total number of employees of Chinese enterprises overseas, the report said."

Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell testifies during a Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee hearing on the CARES Act, at the Hart Senate Office Building in Washington, D.C., U.S., September 28, 2021. /Reuters

U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell faced an uncharacteristically hostile congressional hearing on Tuesday in which lawmakers demanded more action in response to perceived lapses over everything from ethics and diversity to inflation and financial regulation, and a prominent Democrat said she would not back him for another term.

The most pointed moment came when Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, a vocal critic of the Fed's oversight of Wall Street under Powell, called him a ""dangerous man"" to head the central bank.

""Renominating you means gambling that ... a Republican chair who has regularly voted to deregulate Wall Street won't drive this economy over a financial cliff again,"" Warren said during a hearing by the Senate Banking Committee. ""I just don't think that's a risk worth taking.""

For Powell, his appearance before the committee – notionally to discuss the Fed's response to the coronavirus pandemic – was the latest chapter in one of the choppier stretches he has endured as the central bank's chief, just as the White House weighs whether to retain him in the role.

On Monday, two of the Fed's 12 regional reserve bank presidents announced their departures, weeks after they were revealed to have been active investors. Powell has launched a sweeping review of the rules governing Fed officials' financial dealings as a result, but it has not stopped the drumbeat of critics who say he should have acted more forcefully.

Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, the committee's Democratic chairman, said he would introduce legislation barring Fed officials from owning individual stocks.

Another Democratic Senator, Raphael Warnock from Georgia, said: ""This is a blow to the image of the central bank."" He asked Powell about what steps he is taking to protect the ""impartiality"" of the Fed.

And Republican Senator Steve Daines of Montana asked if Powell would agree to subjecting the heads of the quasi-private regional reserve banks to the Freedom of Information Act to allow for greater public scrutiny of their activities, something Powell said he would like to ""reflect on.""

Powell said the central bank is also examining the trades done by regional Fed presidents to make sure they were legal and in compliance with current ethics guidelines.

""Even if it appears to be the case that these trades were in compliance with existing rules, that just tells you the problem is the rules and the practices and the disclosure needs to be improved,"" Powell said in response to Warnock's question. ""We will rise to this moment and address this.""

Cool reception

Tuesday's hearing was a decidedly chillier environment than Powell has typically faced on Capitol Hill since taking over as Fed chair in early 2018. Powell has gone to greater lengths than his predecessors to cultivate relationships with Congress, an effort that insulated him early on when he faced the wrath of the man who appointed him, former President Donald Trump.

In addition to the ordeal over trading by Fed officials, lawmakers questioned Powell's rationale that inflation – running at roughly twice its targeted 2% pace – was ""transitory"" and pressed him on the Fed's ""dismal failure"" to improve diversity in its ranks.

The number of minorities in management positions had ""barely budged"" during Powell's tenure, Democratic Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey said.

Powell said diversity was a ""high priority"" and, in response to a question from committee Chairman Brown, said he would welcome the appointment of a Black woman for the first time to the Fed's seven-member Board of Governors.

The next chapter of the leadership of the Fed remained in focus during the entire proceeding.

""You know Chair Powell, the elephant in the room is whether you are going to be renominated for a second term as Fed chair,"" Warren said before announcing she would vote against him if he were reappointed by President Joe Biden.

The Biden administration has not announced a decision on whether to reappoint Powell, whose term expires in February, nor on a slate of other vacancies and pending openings on the Fed board. One board seat is currently empty and both vice chair positions – for financial regulation and monetary policy – will come open between October and January.

The White House would not comment on Warren's remark that Powell was a ""dangerous man"" to run the Fed, but some outside observers lowered their expectations that Powell will be renominated.

""Confidence in the likelihood of reappointment ebbed a bit as time passed with no action from the White House, weakened some further when the controversy over trading by Dallas Fed President Kaplan and Boston Fed President Rosengren threatened to contaminate Powell, and took a dive today as Senator Warren went for the jugular, describing him as a 'dangerous man,' Evercore ISI Vice Chairman Krishna Guha wrote."

Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, takes part in a panel discussion about investing in Detroit at the Kennedy School of Government, Harvard University, in Cambridge, Massachusetts, U.S., April 11, 2018. /Reuters

JPMorgan Chase & Co has begun preparing for the possibility of the United States hitting its debt limit, Chief Executive Jamie Dimon told Reuters on Tuesday, adding he nevertheless expected policymakers to find a solution to avoid that ""potentially catastrophic"" event.

The country's largest lender has begun scenario-planning for how a potential U.S. credit default would affect the repo and money markets, client contracts, its capital ratios, and how rating agencies would react, Dimon said in an interview.

""This is like the third time we've had to do this, it is a potentially catastrophic event,"" he said.

""Every single time this comes up, it gets fixed, but we should never even get this close. I just think this whole thing is mistaken and one day we should just have a bipartisan bill and get rid of the debt ceiling. It's all politics,"" he added.

Congressional Democrats are scrambling to find a way to raise the government's $28.4-trillion borrowing cap before the Treasury Department runs out of means to service the nation's debt. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has said the Treasury will likely exhaust extraordinary measures by October 18.

Democrats have prepared votes to head off a government shutdown and a potentially economically crippling U.S. credit default on Tuesday, but a quick resolution appeared unlikely in the face of continued Republican resistance.

Fiscal brinkmanship has become a regular feature of U.S. politics over the past decade thanks to ongoing partisan polarization, with debt ceiling deals coming down to the wire in 2011 and 2017.

Bloomberg reported last week that Secretary Yellen had called the leaders of the biggest Wall Street financial firms to recruit them in her campaign to pressure Republicans to agree to a deal. The Treasury declined to comment on the report.

Dimon said as part of its preparation the bank was combing through its client contracts, a resource-intensive process.

""You've got to check the contracts to try to predict it out ... If I remember correctly, the last time we got prepared for this, it cost us $100 million,"" he said.

At the meeting, the company vowed to go all out to safeguard the bottom line of power supply to meet people's basic needs.

A recent power outage has affected residents and factories in northeastern China, triggering fears that a sustained power crunch will last until winter.

Power rationing began in northeast China's Jilin, Heilongjiang and Liaoning provinces last Thursday. Power supply to residential areas and traffic lights were also affected.

Factories in more regions across the country, including south China's Guangdong Province, have also experienced power outages or power rationing.

SGCC president Xin Baoan listed a couple of reasons for the power disruptions, including fast-growing electricity demand, a short supply of coal and frequent natural disasters since the start of the year. He added that the situation was exacerbated in September due to a combination of factors.

The State Grid also vowed to monitor high energy consumption and heavy pollution by industries strictly.

502,Data security a key to digital network reliability,"Like many places in China, a large amount of services have been digitalized in Wuzhen, an ancient water town in eastern Zhejiang Province. Using services like digital payments and check-ins using facial scans, technologies like big data and artificial intelligence seem omnipresent. But is the whole digital network reliable?

Sometimes yes, sometimes not.

""When the operation of the country, society and the governance of the government, including the operation of many factories and enterprises, and even the people's daily lives are all built on big data and the internet, the world becomes particularly fragile,"" Zhou Hongyi, chairman and CEO of Qihoo 360 told CGTN on Sunday at the sidelines of World Internet Conference (WIC).

Imagine if the virtual world and the physical world are more and more connected, some small bugs on the internet may cause power shut down and personal data leak. This issue was widely discussed at this WIC, which was held from Sunday to Tuesday in Wuzhen.

""Data security is key to the success of intelligent and connected vehicles. It is not only closely linked to individual's interests, but also matters to the whole society,"" said Tesla CEO Elon Musk in his online speech at WIC on Sunday.

Craig Allen, president of U.S.-China Business Council, said in a sub-forum of WIC that data is ""understood as an essential element to our daily lives as we move through the digital world.""

""We understand the increased complexity of data governance and the challenges that this regulatory environment poses to businesses and governments around the world,"" Allen said online.

That is why China has been continuously strengthening data regulation. The country's Data Security Law came into effect on September 1. Together with the upcoming Personal Information Protection Law, effective November 1, the two laws will require companies in China to make sure the data they hold is safe.

""To solve the threat of cybersecurity [problems] to digitalization requires systematic approaches, which requires new tactics, a new framework, and the establishment of new capabilities,"" said Zhou.

Musk said Tesla is glad to see these new laws and regulations that have released to strengthen data management. He added that data protection is not only an issue of one single company but should be a mutual effect for all industry players.

503,White paper hails Chinese economy's 'historic transformation',"China's economic strength has increased significantly over the past 70 years, with GDP soaring from 67.9 billion yuan ($10.5 billion) in 1952 to 101.6 trillion yuan in 2020, according to a white paper ""China's Epic Journey from Poverty to Prosperity"" released on Tuesday.

The world's second largest economy, China now accounts for over 17 percent of global GDP. And for the past 11 years, it has been the world's largest manufacturer, with an output of over 220 major industrial products, the white paper said.

China also ranks first in the world in terms of trade in goods and foreign exchange reserves, and second in terms of its trade in services and consumer market.

""China has achieved a historic transformation from a low-income country to an upper-middle-income country, with per capita GDP rising from less than $100 in 1952 to over $10,000 in 2020,"" the white paper noted.

""The country has a middle-income group of over 400 million people, and this number keeps expanding, offering a supersized market that is growing faster than any other place in the world,"" it said.

In 2020, China was the first country to reopen its economy after bringing COVID-19 under control. It was also the first economy to shift back from negative to positive growth, reflecting the resilience of the economy.

China's employed population has risen from 180 million in 1949 to 750 million in 2020, and the job market remains stable, according to the white paper.

Decades ago, farmers made up a large proportion of the population. But the employment structure has changed and 47.7 percent of the workforce is now employed in the tertiary sector, while 61.6 percent is working in cities.

New jobs, such as deliverymen and ride-hailing drivers have emerged, which has brought a profound change to the mindset of the workforce, broadened their choices and expanded the forms of employment available, the white paper also said."
504,China's industrial profits up 49.5% in first eight months,"Profits rose 10.1 percent from a year earlier to 680.3 billion yuan in August, compared with a 16.4-percent increase in July, slowing for a sixth consecutive month, data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed.

China's industrial enterprises above designated size achieved a total profit of 5.6 trillion yuan (about $870 billion) in the first eight months of 2021, with a year-on-year increase of 49.5 percent, slowing from a 57.3-percent gain in the January-July period, official data showed Tuesday.

""A sustained and stable recovery in corporate profits is facing more challenges,"" said Zhu Hong, senior statistician at the NBS, in a statement.

""The COVID-19 is still spreading in some areas, overall prices of bulk commodities are high, the cost of international logistics is elevated, and the shortage of chips is pushing up corporate costs,"" Zhu explained.

Earlier this month, China released crude oil from its national reserves for the first time to alleviate stress on businesses over rising raw material costs.

Partly due to surging coal prices and shortages, a handful of provinces across the country are facing a power crunch that has forced factories to cease operations, clouding the economic outlook.

Nomura has further cut its forecast for the country's GDP growth in the third quarter and the fourth quarter to 4.7 percent and 3 percent, respectively, from 5.1 percent and 4.4 percent.

The data covers companies with annual revenues of over 20 million yuan from their main operations."
505,China State Grid promises power after scattered outages,"China's national power company on Monday said it will ""fight a battle"" to ensure electricity across the nation and try its best to avoid power outages.

In a statement released on its website, the State Grid said it will make full use of cross-region power supplies to ensure electricity for people's daily life and ""hold up the bottom line for livelihood, development and security.""

The promise came after a power outage affected residents and factories in northeast China, triggering fears of a sustained power crunch that will hurt heating supply as winter draws close to the country's coldest region.

Factories in more regions across the country, including south China's Guangdong Province, recently experienced power outages or power rationing.

The authorities have blamed the short supply of coal and its rising prices as the primary reason for the power disruptions in northeast China and other provinces across the country. According to experts, the central government's recent warning of a few provinces' failure to meet power consumption control targets have prompted some local governments' radical measures.

Power rationing began in northeast China's Jilin, Heilongjiang and Liaoning last Thursday, and residential and urban traffic control use has also been affected.

Related topics have been hot search terms on Chinese social media platform Weibo, with about 240 million views and about 370 million discussions, while the Baidu Index showed that searches for ""power outage"" surged to a new high on Sunday.

Some social media users from northeast China said on Weibo that they hadn't received any notice in advance about the power cuts, while others appealed to the related government departments to rectify the residential power supply situation as winter is approaching.

The State Grid was cited by the Beijing News on Sunday as saying that the power limit was first exercised on non-residential usage, but there were still gaps that may cause the collapse of the regional power grid, adding to the residential power shortage. It said the recovery of residential power would be a priority.

Local government officials in northeast China on Monday promised to do everything possible to expand coal supplies and guarantee electricity during the winter season.The northeast provinces are among a handful in China facing a power crunch that has forced factories to cease operations.

In August, the National Development and Reform Commission, China's economic regulator, criticized nine provinces and regions for their rising power consumption, prompting action that lead to the current power crunch. Guangdong, Guangxi in the south, Jiangsu, Fujian in the east and Qinghai and Ningxia in the west are among the provincial level places that were criticized for excessive use.

Many other local governments have been taking harsher steps to control their power supplies to meet yearly targets.

China has promised to peak its carbon dioxide emissions by 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060.

The power outages were also partly due to surging coal prices and coal shortages, Lu Ting, chief China economist at Nomura, said in a statement sent to CGTN on Monday. ""The situation has been getting worse over the past weekend,"" he said.

Coal prices have risen worldwide due to resilient market demand boosted by the economic rebound. ""Some [coal-fired power plants] are even trying not to generate electricity in order to stop economic losses,"" said Han Xiaoping, chief analyst at energy industry website china5e.com.

Jiangsu Province, Zhejiang Province and Guangdong Province were among the worst hit by the power crunch. Textile factories in east China's Jiangsu Province faced power cuts last week, and they won't have power again until October 7 or even later, according to the Global Times.

Central China's Hunan Province was short of electricity demand by 3 million to 6 million kilowatt-hours at times, according to the State Grid.

Among the factories that halted production were several key Apple and Tesla suppliers that are facing risks in supply-chain continuity during a peak season for electronics goods, including the latest iPhones.

""The power-supply shock in the world's second-biggest economy and biggest manufacturer will ripple through and impact global markets. I believe the global markets will feel the pinch of a shortage of supply from textiles, toys to machine parts,"" said Lu.

Lu warned there might be implications for global inflation and monetary policies.

The power crunch has prompted the economist to further cut his forecast for the country's GDP growth in the third quarter and the fourth quarter to 4.7 percent and 3 percent, respectively, from 5.1 percent and 4.4 percent.

506,HK business environment has recovered since adoption of security law,"Hong Kong's economy and business environment that were largely impacted by violence in 2019 and 2020 have been effectively back on track since the adoption of the national security law, according to a report issued by the Hong Hong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) government on Monday.

Paul Chan, financial secretary of the HKSAR government, said violence and unreasonable U.S. economic suppression of Hong Kong had a serious impact on its economy and business environment, but with the implementation of the national security law for Hong Kong, the SAR has relied on the advantages of ""One Country, Two Systems"" to recover its social stability and the business environment, creating better conditions for Hong Kong's economic recovery.

The improvements to Hong Kong's electoral system have laid a foundation for the long-term stability and stable development of Hong Kong, enabling it to maintain a safe and vibrant business environment for a long time, the report said.

Economic performance

Hong Kong's economy has shown a ""U-shaped"" trend. It expanded 7.9 percent year on year in the first three months of 2021, of which the growth brought by trade was the highest in the past 10 years.

In the first half of this year, the economy rebounded by 7.8 percent, and the unemployment rate fell from 7.2 percent to 4.7 percent, according to the report.

The financial market situation is also improving. In the 12 months ending in June this year, the amount of IPO funds increased by more than 50 percent, and the turnover of Hong Kong stocks increased by nearly 70 percent, the report said.

In addition, overall crime in the first half of 2021 fell by nearly 10 percent compared with the peak of the violence in the second half of 2019.

Biggest advantage

""One Country, Two Systems"" is the biggest advantage for Hong Kong's business environment, said a spokesperson from the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the HKSAR on Monday.

A survey conducted by the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce showed that over 60 percent of the interviewed companies believe that the national security law will have a positive or neutral impact on their business. The latest Global Financial Center Index report released by research institutes showed that Hong Kong's overall ranking has returned to the top three in the world, the spokesperson said.

The report demonstrates Hong Kong's good business environment and its status as a powerful international financial center. It is a powerful counterattack of the U.S. maliciously slandering Hong Kong's business environment, said a spokesperson from the Office of the Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China in the HKSAR.

The recently implemented wealth management connect in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area and two new cooperation zones of Hengqin and Hetao will bring more opportunities to Hong Kong, said the spokesperson.

U.S. anti-China forces are the biggest destroyer of Hong Kong's business environment. But, at the same time, the central government has always been a staunch defender of Hong Kong's business environment, said a spokesperson from Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of China's State Council.

Under U.S. support and other external forces, anti-China disruptors in Hong Kong instigated the regulation amendment disturbance in 2019 and turned it into a riot, which severely trampled on the rule of law in Hong Kong, and harmed the business environment, said the spokesperson.

The implementation of the national security law for Hong Kong and the improvement of the region's election system are all aimed at restoring good order and returning to the right track of development in Hong Kong so that the ""One Country, Two Systems"" policy can be fully and accurately implemented, the spokesperson said."

509,Egypt: The aquaculture research lab boosting fish production,"At a massive Egyptian fish farm in an open field with dozens of ponds of different sizes, fishermen were spreading their nets to collect the Nile tilapia fish and sort them out for sale based on their size, returning those too little back to ponds for further growth.

The research ponds belong to the Central Laboratory for Aquaculture Research (CLAR), which is based in Sharqia province in northeastern Egypt and belongs to the Agricultural Research Center of the country's Ministry of Agriculture.

CLAR does not only help aquaculture and pisciculture in Egypt with researches and studies conducted on its research ponds, but it also boosts the fish production in Egypt through its production ponds, including 160 large ponds stretching on an area of nearly 1,200 feddans (over 5 square km).

""CLAR helps increase Egypt's fish production via applied research, through which our researchers conduct studies to boost production, such as finding cheaper but efficient types of fish feed, which represents a high cost in fish farming,"" said Amira el-Hanafy, director of the aquaculture research lab.

She continued that CLAR's researchers also help with finding new breeds of fish with fast growth and high reproduction rates, which also serves the overall fish production in Egypt.

""Egypt's annual fish production amounts to 2.2 million tonnes, 80 percent of which is produced through fish farming,"" CLAR chief told reporters near one of the large production ponds.

Around 40 small ponds, whose size is lower than 1 feddan (4,200 square meters) are mainly for research yet they are productive as well, but not as much as those 160 large production ponds whose size is about 7 feddans (29,400 square meters) each, according to Hamed Mohamed Hamed, manager of the production farm and head of the guidance and training department at CLAR.

""Now we have been fishing the little ones, whose weight have reached about 25 or 30 grams, then we move them to the production ponds to take their production period,"" the production farm manager explained.

For his part, Osama Abdel-Rahman Saleh, chief researcher at the department of fish health and care, noted that CLAR rents all the 160 large production ponds to investors to use the money for research and development while the ponds still belong to CLAR in the end."

Water is sprayed over piles of coal at the Port of Newcastle in Newcastle, New South Wales, Australia, October 12, 2020. /CFP

Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison refused to commit to phasing out fossil fuels as a major climate conference approaches, while his deputy doubled down on opposing targets for net zero emissions of greenhouse gases.

Australia, the world's top coal and a major gas exporter, is under growing pressure to come up with emissions reduction targets ahead of November's COP26 United Nations climate conference in Scotland.

The International Monetary Fund called on Australia to set a ""time bound"" target to reach net zero emissions on Friday, when the country's treasurer warned that Australia must brace for much higher borrowing costs if it fails to commit to a net zero target by 2050, as many peers have done.

In interviews with Australian media after a summit in Washington, Morrison said his government was still working on its emissions plans, declining to commit to curbing fossil fuels that account for a major part of Australia's export revenue.

He told broadcaster SBS in an interview that aired on Saturday night that he was not prepared to pull back any fossil fuel industries immediately.

""We don't have to, because that change will take place over time,"" he said. ""We are working on the transition technologies and fuels and the ultimate technologies that will be there over the next 20, 30 years that can get us to net zero ... This doesn't happen overnight.""

Morrison, who has a largely undefined slogan of ""technology not taxes"", was part of a government that torpedoed a carbon pricing scheme after winning the 2013 election while opposing the mechanism as a tax.

His deputy prime minister, climate change sceptic Barnaby Joyce, dug in on Sunday against a net zero target.

""We look at it through the eyes of making sure there is not an unreasonable, or any loss of ... regional jobs,"" Joyce, whose National party represents largely rural voters, told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.

Joyce said proceeds from mining and agriculture industries were vital for people in regional towns, from hairdressers to auto service providers.

""You've got to remember, fossil fuels are your nation's largest export and if you take away your nation's largest export, you've got to accept a lower standard of living,"" he said."

Among the obligations for auction winners, they must bring high-speed internet to thousands of schools to building 4G infrastructure along roadways.

Communications Minister Fabio Faria announced the date of the auction on Friday on Twitter. Full rules for the auction are expected to be published on Monday, according to telecoms regulator Anatel.

Anatel had put off a decision on the rules on September 13 with board members at the regulator requesting further time for analysis. Anatel's board approved the auction in an extraordinary meeting on Friday, the minister said.

Last week, Faria said Sao Paulo and other large Brazilian cities will have 5G networks working by the end of the year and all state capitals will have the technology by July 2022.

The 5G auction will be the largest spectrum auction ever managed by Anatel. The Brazilian government expects companies to pay up to 45 billion reais ($8.5 billion) for the operating licenses for four different frequencies to be auctioned."

Michael Makuei Lueth, Minister of Information and Broadcasting said that protests that broke out on September 17 in eastern Sudan leading to the closure of oil terminals at Port Sudan have disrupted transportation of crude, leaving Juba wary.

""With the closure of Port Sudan, we are not in a position to export our (crude) oil because if we don't export oil then we will be in crisis,"" Makuei told journalists in Juba after the weekly cabinet meeting.

Oil-producing South Sudan relies on neighboring Sudan's infrastructure to transport its crude for export.

The Sudanese protestors said to be aggrieved by being left out of the peace deal signed in October 2020 in the South Sudanese capital, Juba, have blocked the main road connecting Port Sudan affecting operations at the port.

""The government of Sudan declared the situation in Port Sudan as a force majeure and efforts are underway to have this issue resolved so that our oil can flow,"" said Makuei.

He disclosed that President Salva Kiir is in contact with authorities in Khartoum to help resolve the issue in order to allow the smooth flow of crude to the key port.

Sudanese authorities on Tuesday foiled an attempted coup allegedly by supporters of former long-time ruler Omar Al-Bashir in what it said was meant to derail the ongoing transition period following the latter's ouster in 2019."

522,Basic facts about the 2nd China-Africa Economic and Trade Expo,"The second China-Africa Economic and Trade Expo (CAETE) will take place in Changsha City, central China's Hunan Province, from September 26 to 29, 2021. About 176 projects in trade, investment, project contracting and strategic cooperation with a value of $15.93 billion are expected to be signed during the Expo. Among them, 115 have passed the preliminary review.

Hosts: It's a biennial event organized by the Ministry of Commerce of the People's Republic of China and the Hunan Provincial People's Government.

History: CAETE was proposed by Chinese President Xi Jinping at the 2018 Beijing Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation. It's a platform for both sides to deepen economic and trade cooperation. The first expo was held in June 2019 with 84 cooperation deals worth $20.8 billion signed. The deals covered trade, investment, infrastructure, agriculture, manufacturing, aviation, tourism and establishing friendship cities.

Theme: ""New Start, New Opportunities, New Accomplishment."" Six African countries, comprising Algeria, Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda, South Africa and Senegal, are this year's expo's guests of honor. Information on their investment environment, trade policies, key products and tourism will be highlighted.

523,Meng Wanzhou expresses gratitude to China in message on way home,"Meng Wanzhou, chief financial officer of Huawei, on Saturday expressed gratitude to China, the Communist Party of China (CPC) and the Chinese government for leading her home.

""Without a strong motherland, there would be no freedom as I am today,"" Meng said from the plane, which is expected to land in China soon. ""I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the Chinese embassy in Canada for their consistent support,"" she added.

Growing up in the period of reform and opening-up, Meng said she was grateful to have witnessed and personally experienced the achievements of China and the Chinese people under the leadership of the CPC.

""All my compatriots have worked hard for decades to make our motherland prosperous and strong, and the people march towards common prosperity, which also makes great contributions to world peace and development.""

""Fortunately, we were born in a peaceful era... The most valuable thing is that I was born in a great country,"" Meng said.

""My yearning and longing for my country ignited the fire of faith in my heart, illuminated the darkest moments of my life and led me on the long journey home,"" She said."

Creditors of HNA Group applied for bankruptcy and restructuring in court in January after the company failed to pay off due debts."
525,Challenges emerge as China bans blocking of web links,"Some industry practitioners cheered at China's move to end the practice of internet companies blocking access to web links to competitors' sites, while others cautioned about challenges regarding competition, data security and monopoly.

The regulatory move may end, for example, customers' unpleasant experience of not being able to use Tencent's WeChat Pay to buy things on Alibaba's e-commerce marketplaces Taobao and Tmall.

Last Friday, WeChat released a statement saying that users will be able to have access to web links from other platforms from the app's upgraded version.

Cross-platform link blocking has also added operational costs for the Multi-Channel Network (MCN) companies that support e-commerce livestreamers, as they have to cultivate their Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs) on more than one platform.

""At first Douyin allowed access to Tmall stores. But then, Douyin set up its private traffic operation, connected to its app. So we haven't been encouraging merchants to operate across platforms, because it increased the cost of customer acquisition,"" said Peng Qingqing, the CEO of MCN company ShareYa.

Now a more transparent internet environment is on the way. China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) last week issued instructions that all instant messaging platforms must remove their webpage address blocking functions as of September 17. The ministry will also take action against companies that have not come into compliance, to build a standardized and secure internet environment.

The move was welcomed by companies like ShareYa. But it also presents challenges to e-commerce platforms.

""For example, Tmall and JD.com are pure e-commerce platforms, so merchants on those platforms should focus more on products and prices. But social platforms like Douyin, Red and Kuaishou focus more on content. Now, merchants on shopping websites also need to know how to tell stories that have an emotional resonance with buyers, because they may have to operate across platforms. This requires companies to be more comprehensive,"" said Peng.

On the other hand, Roland Berger Project Manager Jiang Han warns of privacy issues as platforms transition from an advertisement-based business model into more of a transaction-based model.

""All the different platforms can collect user data from other different sources. That is good for the company. But it might be a concern for user privacy. So these platforms might need to enhance their capability in this area,"" Jiang said.

There is also debate about whether cross-platform connectivity will further strengthen the presence of leading players and encourage monopoly. Liu Chi, a professor from the Beijing Institute of Technology gives a firm ""no"" when talking to CGTN's Global Business. Liu said the platforms will build an ecosystem that boosts resource-sharing and collaboration among mobile payment apps, shopping apps, social networks and entertainment companies.

""It will lead to fair competition and bring benefits to the end-users. It will reduce transaction costs for sellers, and it means more choices for users as well,"" Liu said.

Liu also said it's more important now for the government to support smaller-sized companies as they try to break into an existing ecosystem built by the internet giants.

526,PBOC says virtual currency-related activities are illegal,"China's central bank said on Friday all virtual currency-related activities are illegal, according to a notice jointly issued by 11 agencies in a further crackdown on virtual money trading and speculation.

Virtual currency such as Bitcoin and Ether does not have the same legal status as legal currency. They should not and cannot be used as currency in the Chinese market, according to the notice.

Overseas virtual currency exchanges to provide services for domestic residents via the internet are also considered illegal financial activities, the notice said.

A slew of measures will be rolled out to strengthen regulation of the sector. Financial institutions and non-bank payment institutions are also banned from offering services for virtual currency-related business activities.

The notice said China will strengthen the management of internet content and access, as well as market entity registration and advertising related to virtual currencies.

It also warned that the country will also severely crack down on virtual currency-related illegal financial activities and criminal activities, including money laundering and gambling.

China has recently taken a tough line on virtual currencies. In May, the country banned financial, payment institutions from cryptocurrency business amid price volatility.

Cryptocurrency mining

In addition, the country launched new measures to prohibit and eliminate cryptocurrency mining, according to another notice issued by China's National Development and Reform Commission on Friday.

Fiscal, taxation, financial and electricity support for cryptocurrency mining is strictly forbidden. Boundaries between mining, blockchain, big data, cloud computing and other industries will be distinguished to prevent mining activities in the name of a data center, according to the notice.

Cryptocurrency mining projects are not allowed to participate in the electricity market. Those that have entered the market need to be withdrawn within a time limit, said the notice."
527,U.S. pledges $10 billion to boost UN food initiative,"The United States of America has pledged $10 billion to eradicate hunger, poverty, ensure gender equality and limit the climate crisis, boosting the UN initiative to improve the global food systems.

The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) announced the fund during the first United Nations Food Systems Summit (UNFSS) held in New York on Thursday.

Around $5 billion will be spent to support Feed the Future program, a global hunger and food security initiative. The remaining fund will be invested within the U.S, said a statement issued by the White House on Thursday.

""We must use the power of ingenuity to improve on food systems, so they provide safe, nutritious, affordable, and accessible food for all, while conserving natural resources, and combating the climate crisis,"" said Tom Vilsack, Secretary, United States Department of Agriculture.

The UNFSS, also termed 'people's summit,' aims to build a global collaboration to tackle the triple challenge of ensuring zero hunger, a sustainable food supply, and limiting the rising global temperature.

Why are food systems failing?

While agriculture contributes to nearly a quarter, livestock emits around 14 percent of the global emissions. But meat production releases twice the emission than that of plant-based food, said a study released last week.

Moreover, close to 90 percent of the $54 billion subsidies spent on the agricultural and meat sector globally every year is spent in areas that contribute massively to climate change, affect food price, and exacerbate pollution, said the UN report released ahead of the summit.

Despite lucrative subsidies, more than 800 million people worldwide faced chronic hunger last year, and 2.37 billion people could not get enough food throughout the year. The COVID-19 pandemic has worsened the situation further, with the prevalence of undernourishment increasing to around 9.9 percent in 2020.

""We, as the global community, are not delivering on our promises to eradicate hunger,"" said President Sauli Niinistö of Finland. ""In Finland, free-of-charge school meals have been provided since the 1940s... to address post-war poverty and malnutrition,"" he said while addressing the summit.

The summit held close on the heels of the Global Biodiversity Summit, COP15 in October and Global Climate Change Summit, COP26 in November, is also an effort to motivate countries to pledge towards creating sustainable food systems.

""Food being at the front and center of Climate, COP26, and Biodiversity, COP15, is the only way to address the triple challenge of climate change, nature loss and food insecurity,"" said João Campari, Global Food Lead at WWF International.

528,U.S. firms in China confident despite COVID-19 and bilateral tensions,"Most U.S. companies operating in China are confident about their business prospects in the country despite the COVID-19 pandemic and stagnant China-U.S. relations, according to a survey released by the American Chamber of Commerce (AmCham) in Shanghai on Thursday.

The survey found that 59.5 percent out of 338 surveyed U.S. companies operating in China actually increased their investments in the country in 2020, and 82.2 percent expected to achieve revenue growth in 2021.

Despite increasing tensions between China and the U.S. on issues like trade, investment and technology that began three years ago, ""the tenor is optimism,"" said Jeffrey Lehman, the chair of AmCham Shanghai's board of governors.

Ker Gibbs, the chamber's president, also expressed cautious optimism about the future of U.S. companies in China.

American luxury retail sales in China experienced a boom due to COVID-19 travel restrictions, as consumers were unable to travel internationally, according to Jeff Yuan, PwC Asia Pacific transfer pricing services leader.

Low COVID-19 infections allowed the Chinese economy to recover earlier than other economies and helped U.S. companies in China perform better than globally, he said.

AmCham Shanghai said there was no evidence that U.S. companies might shift their production facilities and supply chains out of China in the aftermath of COVID-19.

This was based on the survey's findings that 72 percent of 125 surveyed companies manufacturing in China had no plans to move out of the country in the next three years.

More firms were instead choosing to further localize their supply chains within China due to increased cross-border logistics costs amid the global pandemic, according to the survey.

The surveyed companies were from such industries as automotive, education, logistics, manufacturing, pharmaceuticals, non-consumer electronics and retailers."

China Minmetals Rare Earth and Chinalco Rare Earth & Metals are two of the ""Big Six"" state-owned enterprises (SOEs) that dominate the rare earths industry in China, the world's top producers of the 17 minerals used in consumer electronics and military equipment.

The rare earths arm of China Minmetals Corporation said on Thursday its parent company was planning a strategic restructuring of rare earth assets with another state-owned firm, Chinalco, and the government of Ganzhou City.

In a filing (link in Chinese) to the Shenzhen Stock Exchange, China Minmetals Rare Earth did not specify what sort of restructuring was under discussion, adding that the plan needs approval from authorities.

Ganzhou City in east China's Jiangxi Province is one of the country's two main rare earth production hubs. It is home to the headquarters of China Minmetals Rare Earth as well as another of the ""Big Six"" SOEs, China Southern Rare Earth Group.

It is reported that the restructuring is likely to involve China Southern Rare Earth Group in Ganzhou. The three-way combination would create China's second-largest rare earth producer by capacity, behind China Northern Rare Earth Group, said David Merriman, a manager at consultancy Roskill.

With capacity to produce around 45,000 tonnes per year of rare earth oxides, it would also control production in the Chinese regions of Guangxi, Hunan, Yunnan and Shandong and have operations in Fujian and Sichuan, Merriman said.

China is the primary source of rare earths for most countries. In 2020, China held about 37 percent of the world's rare earth reserves, and produced around 60 percent of global supply, according to the United States Geological Survey. It is also the only country that can provide all 17 rare earth elements.

The country has a global lead in rare earth production because of high efficiency and low costs, according to Mei Xinyu, a researcher from the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation.

Since 2011, the number of China's rare earth patents has surpassed the rest of the world put together. Although it began to apply for rare earth patents 33 years later than the U.S., it has already accumulated 23,000 more, according to consultancy ThREE.

Rare earths are a group of 17 chemical elements found in minerals. With magnetic and optical properties, they are used in small doses to produce powerful effects, giving them the nickname ""vitamins of chemistry.""

China Minmetals Rare Earth has seen its share price climb more than 230 percent year-to-date as rare earth prices jump on fears of tight supply.

Nike cut its sales forecast Thursday, pointing to myriad supply chain problems that are delaying deliveries of athletic gear and expected to crimp sales for the next few quarters.

The sports giant is dealing with a doubling of shipping times from its Asian manufacturing centers to North America, as well as closures of major factories in Vietnam and Indonesia due to local government restrictions because of COVID-19 pandemic, Chief Financial Officer Matt Friend said on a conference call with analysts.

Shipping conditions have been bad for much of 2021 and ""deteriorated even further"" in the most recent quarter, Friend said, noting port backlogs, rail congestion and labor shortages.

""Lost weeks of production combined with longer transit times will lead to short-term inventory shortages in the marketplace for the next few quarters,"" he said. ""We expect all geographies to be impacted by these problems.""

The company now expects fiscal 2022 sales growth in the ""mid single digits,"" compared with the earlier outlook for ""low double digit growth,"" Friend said.

The comments came as Nike reported profits of $1.9 billion in the quarter ending August 31, up 23 percent from the year-ago period.

Revenues climbed 16 percent to $12.2 billion, but still fell short of analyst expectations by more than $200 million during the quarter ending August 31.

The company faced longer shipping times in North America and its Europe, Middle East & Africa region, while China's sales were dented by government restrictions enacted in July due to the pandemic, Friend said.

The sports giant reported a 20-percent rise in selling and administrative expenses. Spending went for wages and boosted digital marketing, as well as higher shipping costs.

Friend said that manufacturing plants in Indonesia were back operating, but that most of the company's operations in Vietnam have been dormant since the summer. Nike expects to resume the Vietnam operations in October, meaning it will lose about 10 weeks of production, he said.

Moreover, Friend said resuming work can only be done gradually, adding, ""it will take time.""

For the remainder of fiscal 2022, ""we expect strong marketplace demand to exceed available supply,"" Friend said.

Nike's shares fell 3.5 percent to $154.00 in after-hours trading."

For China-U.S. relations, innovation is a ""golden key"" to some thorny issues, said the ambassador. He said the two countries can cooperate on climate change, COVID-19 response and economic recovery, which are innovation intensive and very promising areas for cooperation.

Qin stressed that the Cold War mentality and zero-sum game go against the trend of the times and the will of the people, and that the Chinese people never believe in the ""Thucydides trap.""

""China will continue to expand opening-up, continue to do business with the world, and promote technology and trade cooperation with the U.S. side. The U.S. side also needs to create conditions, instead of barriers, for our cooperation,"" said the ambassador."

German automaker Volkswagen AG is commencing construction of a new electric vehicle (EV) battery system factory in Hefei City, east China's Anhui Province, the company announced on Thursday.

The new plant, VW Anhui Components Company, is scheduled to start production in 2023 and will deliver over 150,000 battery systems a year for Volkswagen Anhui's all-electric models. The group in China will wholly own the first battery system plant, it added.

""Anhui is an important pillar of our global battery strategy,"" Volkswagen Group Board Member Technology, Thomas Schmall said. The company will invest more than 140 million euros ($164 million) in the new battery plant by 2025.

""With a significant increase of battery-electric vehicles in the years to come, we need to focus on keeping key components like battery systems in our own value chain. Our target is for our Volkswagen Group China fleet to reach over 40 percent new energy vehicle (NEV) by 2030,"" Volkswagen Group China CEO Stephan Wöllenstein said.

With an area of over 45,000 square meters, the plant will be located next to the production facilities of Volkswagen Anhui, Volkswagen's first majority-owned joint venture for all-electric vehicles in China, according to the group.

As the world's biggest car market, China has seen a steep growth in its NEV sector in recent years. From industry-leading players to start-ups, thousands of companies have been jumping into the NEV bandwagon, engaging in manufacturing cars, batteries, and other related components.

The number of new Chinese enterprises related to NEV surged by 77,000 in the first half of this year, an increase of 165.5 percent year on year, bringing the total to more than 321,000 in China, according to the Chinese business database Qichacha.

In August, the production and sales of NEVs in China were 309,000 and 321,000, respectively, a year-on-year increase of 1.8 times for both, despite vehicle sales fall on-chip shortages.

With the penetration rate of NEVs increased to 17.8 percent, the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers expected China to achieve the mid-and long-term planning target of 20 percent of NEVs in 2025 ahead of schedule."

Boeing Co. raised its forecast slightly on Thursday for China's aircraft demand for the next 20 years, betting on the country's quick rebound from COVID-19 and future growth in its budget airline sector and e-commerce.

Chinese airlines will need 8,700 new airplanes through 2040, 1.2 percent higher than its previous prediction of 8,600 planes made last year. Those would be worth $1.47 trillion based on list prices, the U.S. planemaker said in a statement.

The 1.2-percent increase contrasted with the 6.3-percent growth Boeing forecast last year, which made China a bright spot in the aviation market at the height of coronavirus lockdowns worldwide.

Earlier this month, Boeing revised up long-term forecasts for global airplane demand on the back of a strong recovery in commercial air travel in domestic markets like the United States.

""There are promising opportunities to significantly expand international long-haul routes and air freight capacity,"" said Richard Wynne, managing director of China marketing at Boeing's commercial arm.

""Longer-term, there is the potential for low-cost carrier growth to further build on single-aisle demand.""

China's domestic aviation market, although still vulnerable to sporadic local COVID-19 outbreaks, has more or less rebounded to pre-COVID levels, but the country's borders remain virtually closed, with the number of international flights only 2 percent of pre-COVID levels.

Boeing projected a need for nearly 6,500 new single-aisle airplanes over the next 20 years, while China's widebody fleet, including passenger and cargo models, will require 1,850 new planes, accounting for 20 percent of total deliveries.

Air freight market has become a bright spot for Boeing in China as e-commerce demand booms, even as the U.S. planemaker struggles with sales of passenger jets due to trade tensions and the grounding of its 737 MAX.

China's aviation authority, the first regulator to ground 737 MAX following two deadly crashes, has yet to approve the return of service for the aircraft in the country. China accounts for a quarter of Boeing's orders of all aircraft.

China will also need nearly $1.8 trillion worth of commercial services for its aircraft fleet over the 20-year period, company said."

The 13th China-Northeast Asia Expo launched online and offline in Changchun, capital of northeast China's Jilin Province, on Thursday.

Over 1,000 enterprises from countries and regions in Northeast Asia are expected to participate in this five-day event.

First launched in 2005, the expo has become a major platform for countries in Northeast Asia to build consensus and conduct economic and trade cooperation, with a total of 2,822 cooperation projects signed.

Northeast Asia is one of the world's most dynamic regions. In 2020, the trade volume between China and five countries in Northeast Asia – Japan, the Republic of Korea, Russia, Mongolia and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea – mounted to $717.7 billion, accounting for nearly one-sixth of China's total foreign trade, according to the Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM).

In the first half of 2021, the trade volume of China with five other countries in the region totaled about $417.9 billion, up 26 percent year on year.

Cumulative two-way investment between China and Northeast Asian countries exceeded $250 billion by the end of June this year, achieving fruitful results in investment cooperation in infrastructure, energy manufacturing and agriculture, the MOFCOM said.

On Wednesday, the second Northeast Asia Regional Cooperation Roundtable, a major sideline event of the expo, was held. Representatives from China and the other five countries in Northeast Asia attended the meeting.

The roundtable has issued an initiative, calling on local governments in the region to connect their market resources and jointly build a Northeast Asia maritime economic cooperation community.

536,AIIB welcomes China's pledge to stop building coal-fired plants abroad,"The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) welcomed China's announcement to increase support for green and low-carbon energy generation in developing countries and stop building new coal-fired projects overseas.

On Tuesday, in a video remark at the general debate of the 76th session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA), Chinese President Xi Jinping announced the country's decision to stop investment in coal-fired plants overseas.

China will step up support for other developing countries in promoting green and low-carbon energy, and will not build new coal-fired power projects abroad, Xi said.

""This is a bold and consequential step for China and for the rest of the world. It is also a clear signal of the country's concrete commitment to global efforts to address one of the most pressing issues of our time,"" said Jin Liqun, president of the AIIB.

Jin said that the international community must continue to work together to agree on a clear pathway to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement with a sense of urgency.

""AIIB is committed to working with China and all of our members in their efforts to implement their Paris commitments to put our world on a path to a sustainable future,"" he said.

AIIB has set a target to invest half of its annual direct financing into projects linked to climate change mitigation by 2025. In 2020, the bank said that 41 percent of the bank's total funding went to climate finance.

At the 75th session of the UNGA in September last year, Xi announced via video that China aims to peak carbon emissions before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060.

537,U.S. business optimism in China rebounds to three-year highs: survey,"U.S. companies' optimism about business conditions in China has recovered to hit three-year highs, an annual survey by the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai and consultancy PwC China showed on Thursday.

The report attributed the renewed optimism to rising revenues as well as ebbing concerns over the COVID-19 pandemic in China.

""Business in China recovered quickly from last year's lockdown,"" said Ker Gibbs, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai, which published the survey that was conducted between mid-June and mid-July.

Of the 338 respondent companies, 78 percent described themselves as ""optimistic or slightly optimistic"" about their five-year business outlook in 2021, nearly 20 percentage points more from 2020 and a return toward 2018 levels, the survey said.

By contrast, in 2021, 10 percent of respondent companies described themselves as ""pessimistic"" about their five-year outlook, compared to 18 percent and 21 percent of respondents in 2020 and 2019, respectively.

The survey showed 77.1 percent of the companies have achieved profitability in 2020, basically keep the same level in recent years. More than 80 percent expect their revenue will keep growing in 2021.

About two-thirds of respondents said they plan to increase their China headcount this year, a 31.4-percentage point increase from 2020, but 62.3 percent of respondents described workforce availability as posing some hindrance or a serious hindrance to operations.

China's borders remain closed to most visitors without proper work and residence permits, and all entrants must complete at least two-week quarantine upon arrival.

The results echo another paper published on the preprint platform SSRN showing that the trade war between the two sides has failed to prompt American businesses to leave China. The research also noted that American and Chinese businesses remained ""deeply integrated"" despite the trade war, and that the costs from tariffs have been passed along to consumers. Foreign investment into China hit a record $144.4 billion in 2020.

The paper's researchers Samantha Vortherms and Jiakun Jack Zhang argued that U.S. tariffs on billions of dollars' worth of Chinese products – launched in mid-2018 to bring U.S. companies home – hurt the U.S. economy and did not successfully pressure China to change its economic policies.

Jiakun Jack Zhang, assistant professor of political science and director of the Trade War Lab at the University of Kansas, points out that smaller companies and newcomers are leaving the Chinese market. But big companies with more experience will face a higher established cost if they plan to exit China. Instead of driving them back to the U.S. to avoid taxes, tariffs hurt American companies to a large extent.

German company, Volocopter, a specialist in the manufacture of autonomous air vehicles, has teamed up with a second-tier subsidiary of Geely Holding Group to establish a joint venture in Chengdu, capital of southwest China's Sichuan Province.

The joint venture, announced on Wednesday, will take charge of production and market operation of Volocopter products in the Chinese market. It plans to help promote urban air mobility (UAM) in China in the coming three to five years.

The new company, which was named Volocopter (Chengdu) Technology Co., Ltd., or Volocopter Chengdu for short, also signed orders with Volocopter for 150 aircraft, including logistics unmanned aerial vehicles and manned aircraft.

Air vehicles and their parts will be produced in Hubei Geely Terrafugia, a manufacturing base of Geely in China, according to the joint venture.

Volocopter Chengdu will also attend the 13th China International Aviation and Aerospace Exhibition (Airshow China) on September 28.

""Today marks another important milestone on our journey to bring affordable electric air mobility to China, the biggest single market opportunity for the UAM industry,"" said Florian Reuter, CEO of Volocopter via video link.

UAM refers to a new mode of urban transportation that uses electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft to move people or goods within lower urban and suburban airspaces. It helps relieve the strain on increasingly congested city roads and allows people and goods to reach their destinations faster and more safely.

Volocopter is currently the world's first and only eVTOL aircraft manufacturer that has obtained design and production approval from the European Union Aviation Safety Agency.

Booming market

Patrick Ky, executive director of the European Union Aviation Safety Agency, said commercial use of air taxis can start to take place in 2024 or 2025.

At present, around 110 cities and regions around the world are working on solutions in air taxis, and the number of new players in the market is constantly growing, according to a report by consulting company Roland Berger in 2020.

""$907 million flowed into the industry in the first six months of 2020 – despite the pandemic and the crisis in the aviation industry,"" said the report.

There will be up to 160,000 commercial air taxis in the air by 2050 and the UAM passenger industry will then generate revenues of almost $90 billion per year, according to the report.

541,Fed foresees a potential rate hike as soon as next year,"Jerome Powell, chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve, speaks during a Senate Banking Committee hearing in Washington, D.C., U.S. /Getty

Jerome Powell, chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve, speaks during a Senate Banking Committee hearing in Washington, D.C., U.S. /Getty

The Federal Reserve signaled Wednesday that it may start raising its benchmark interest rate sometime next year, earlier than it envisioned three months ago and a sign that it's concerned that high inflation pressures may persist.

In a statement, the Fed also said it will likely begin slowing the pace of its monthly bond purchases ""soon"" if the economy keeps improving. The bond purchases have been intended to lower longer-term loan rates to encourage borrowing and spending.

Taken together, the Fed's plans reflect its belief that the economy has recovered sufficiently from the pandemic recession for it to soon begin dialing back the extraordinary support it provided after the coronavirus paralyzed the economy 18 months ago. As the economy has steadily strengthened, inflation has also accelerated to a three-decade high, heightening the pressure on the Fed to pull back.

Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, at his post-meeting news conference, said the Fed is getting closer to achieving its goals on ""substantial further progress"" on inflation and employment.

""For inflation, we appear to have achieved more than significant progress, substantial further progress. That part of the test is achieved in my view and the view of many others,"" he said. ""My own view is the test for substantial further progress on employment is all but met.""

Stock and bond traders appeared pleased by the Fed's policy statement Wednesday, at least initially. Soon after it was issued, the Dow Jones Industrial Average's gain for the day surged from 1 to 1.5 percent. And the yield on the 10-year Treasury note dipped from 1.32 to 1.30 percent.

The committee now sees GDP rising just 5.9 percent this year, compared with a 7-percent forecast in June. However, 2023 growth is now set at 3.8 percent, compared with 3.3 percent previously, and 2.5 percent in 2023, up one-tenth of a percentage point.

Projections also signaled that FOMC members see inflation stronger than projections in June. Core inflation is projected to increase 3.7 percent this year, compared with the 3 percent forecast the last time members gave their expectations. Officials then see inflation at 2.3 percent in 2022, compared with the previous projection of 2.1 percent, and 2.2 percent in 2023, one-tenth of a percentage point higher than the June forecast.

Including food and energy, officials expect inflation to run at 4.2 percent this year, up from 3.4 percent in June. The subsequent two years are expected to fall back to 2.2 percent, little changed from the June outlook.

Before it starts raising rates, though, the Fed expects to begin paring, or tapering, its monthly bond buying. The central bank had signaled last year that it would likely start tapering its $120 billion-a-month in purchases of Treasurys and mortgage bonds once the economy had made ""substantial further progress"" toward the Fed's goals of maximum employment and 2 percent average annual inflation.

""If progress continues broadly as expected, the Committee judges that a moderation in the pace of asset purchases may soon be warranted,"" the Fed said in a statement issued after its two-day meeting ended Wednesday.

Taken together, the Fed's pullback in bond purchases and its eventual rate hikes, whenever they happen, will mean that some borrowers will have to pay more for mortgages, credit cards and business loans.

The Fed's preferred inflation measure – the personal consumption expenditures index less food and energy prices – accelerated by 3.6 percent in July, the highest level in 30 years. However, Powell has said repeatedly that he expects price pressures to subside as supply chain factors, goods shortages and unusually high levels of demand return to pre-pandemic levels."

543,Ant Group's Huabei integrated with China's credit reporting system,"Alibaba-backed Ant Group's consumer credit payment platform, Ant Check Later, also known as Huabei, has been included in China's central bank credit reporting system, the platform announced in a statement on its Weibo on Wednesday.

The statement responds to a notice that users received from the company earlier to upgrade their Huabei service and sign an authorization to report to the financial credit information database.

The reported information includes account opening date, credit line, usage status and repayment status, the Huabei team said in the statement.

Reporting will be conducted monthly, without revealing consumption details such as what and when the credit is used, Huabei added.

China has put a strong emphasis on building a social credit system since the State Council issued a guideline in 2014 and has established the world's largest credit system in 2019. The system creates credit files for almost all people and enterprises involved in credit activities nationwide in a uniform format, being used as a tool in forestalling financial risks and ensuring financial stability.

Concerns buddled up among users after the changes were made on the Huabei platform, leaving some of them worried about its impact on their loan applications from banks.

Huabei said this will not happen if the platform is used under normal circumstances with proper usage and on-time repayments by users, adding that data indicates more than 99 percent of its users have good usage records.

In June, Ant Group got approval from China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission to set up a consumer finance firm – Chongqing Ant Consumer Finance Co. Ltd. – to engage in consumer credit products via Huabei and Jiebei – a platform offering lending services to consumers.

This was part of plans of Ant Group to rectify unfair competition in the payment business, break the information monopoly, as pointed out at a joint regulatory meeting by China's market and financial regulators in April.

Launched in April 2015, Huabei works as a virtual credit card enabling users to enjoy a post-payment shopping experience across e-commerce platforms of Alibaba, but now it has also expanded to offline payment."

545,Delta variant clouds developing Asia's growth outlook – ADB,"Developing Asia's economic rebound this year could be dented by the rapid spread of the Delta variant of the coronavirus, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) said on Wednesday.

However, the bank forecast the East Asia economy will expand by 7.6 percent this year, compared with an earlier prediction of 7.4 percent, citing its vaccination rates as among the highest in the region and governments that were quick to contain outbreaks.

Growth in developing Asia, which groups 46 countries in the Asia-Pacific, is projected to reach 7.1 percent this year, the ADB said in an update to its Asia Development Outlook report, down from its 7.2 percent forecast in July and 7.3 percent in April.

""Developing Asia remains vulnerable to the COVID-19 pandemic, as new variants spark outbreaks, leading to renewed restrictions on mobility in some economies,"" ADB Acting Chief Economist Joseph Zveglich said in a statement.

The ADB said the recovery path within the region remained uneven, given countries' varying degrees of progress in tackling the pandemic.

China is on track to grow 8.1 percent this year, with the pace of expansion projected to slow to 5.5 percent next year, the ADB said.

Southeast Asia, including virus-ravaged Indonesia and the Philippines, was expected to grow 3.1 percent this year, compared with a previous forecast of 4.4 percent.

The ADB expects the Pacific to contract 0.6 percent, having forecast 1.4 percent growth in April.

546,Evergrande Real Estate to make yuan bond coupon payment on time,"Evergrande Group, China's second largest developer, announced on Wednesday it would make an annual interest payment on its domestic yuan bonds on time.

Evergrande's main unit, Evergrande Real Estate, said in a filing with the Shenzhen Stock Exchange that it would make the coupon payment totaling 232 million yuan ($35.88 million) on its 5.8 percent September 2025 bond due September 23.

The announcement comes as Evergrande inches closer to a key deadline for an interest payment on a dollar bond.

The move is expected to soothe investors' fears of default by the indebted group, which had more than $300 billion in liabilities as of the end of June, the company's earnings report showed in August.

It owes $669 million in interest through the end of this year, including $83.5 million in a coupon payment also due September 23 on a dollar bond, Bloomberg reported.

The report, released by real estate services and investment firm CBRE Group, showed that the total direct investment in data centers in the Asia-Pacific region amounted to $1.8 billion in the period, equivalent to 80 percent of last year's total.

The investment in Asia-Pacific is estimated to set a new record this year, after an already record-breaking performance in 2020, according to the agency.

With 5G commercialization, the rapid development of the online economy amid the pandemic and the government's strong support for ""new infrastructure,"" data centers are increasingly favored by investors, said Sam Xie, head of CBRE research in China.

Xie noted that data center investment on the Chinese mainland will continue its upward momentum this year as long-term trends such as tech innovation and consumption upgrades become increasingly important in the strategy development of investors.

548,Fed's upcoming meeting may further confirm 'taper will happen soon',"Editor's note: Jimmy Zhu is chief strategist at Singapore-based Fullerton Research. The article reflects the author's opinion, and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

Global financial markets have become more cautious over the past few days, with U.S. stocks suffering the worst day since May. Those who anticipate another dovish outcome from the upcoming Fed meeting may be disappointed.

The Fed is highly likely to provide more details on quantitative easing tapering in its policy meeting this week, even with some of its recent economic data showing a slowing down of the recovery. If Jerome Powell's Fed continues to skip the messages on a reduction in bond purchases, his credibility would be challenged.

Powell said that the Federal Open Market Committee could start to taper within 2021 at the virtual Jackson Hole symposium last month, though he still didn't see rate hikes in the near term. He also mentioned the U.S. economy has reached a point where it no longer needs much more of the stimulus that was implemented over the past year and a half. Since the Jackson Hole symposium, the fundamentals of the U.S economy haven't made many changes.

The U.S. added 235,000 jobs for August, following a gain of over one million jobs in July, and those gains helped the unemployment rate fall to 5.2 percent last month. On the other hand, the consumer price index has been exceeding 2 percent since March. Having said that, the Fed has little reason to further delay the quantitative easing tapering, because both the labor market and inflation outlook have been moving toward its policy goal.

Furthermore, recent reports showed that various top Fed officials have had a large amount of personal investments in 2020, including Powell. This is definitely not good news for the Fed's credibility and policy independence. Since Powell has already mentioned that tapering this year is likely to be the case, he has to follow the policy outlook he illustrated last month, otherwise, his credibility may face more scrutiny from market participants.

On the other hand, the Fed needs some policy room if any economic condition in the future requires more support. Fed's current policy rate at near-zero levels and unprecedented high balance sheet levels mean there would be no room for further easing if the U.S. economy is to encounter any unexpected shocks. Before the Fed conducts more monetary easing again, it needs to raise the rates by a few hundred basis points or reduce the one-third of the current balance sheet's size based on our analysis.

S&P 500 dropped 1.7 percent on Monday, the declines also reflect the facts that the current U.S. stocks are very sensitive to any negative news or events, and this is due to its overstretched valuations. Looking ahead, U.S. stocks are likely to face increasing downward pressure amid less support in monetary stimulus by the Fed. Over the past year and a half, the monetary stimulus was the major driver behind the U.S. stocks' rally. However, the stocks are still not far away from their record levels in August.

Current stock levels that are still near historical highs show markets have yet to price in the downside risk from the Fed's potential tightening ahead. Once the Fed starts to taper in later of the year, investors' focus is likely to switch to speculating on the timing of rate hike by observing the Fed's dot plot on rates' projection, which could push the dollar significantly higher from the current levels if 2014 is a reliable guide. When ex-Fed chief Ben Bernanke said the Fed would begin paring down its bond purchases in December 2013, the dollar gained around 15 percent in the next 12 months.

Any dollar appreciation would have a significant negative impact on both stocks and commodities. Since the pandemic hit the U.S. economy in March 2020, the negative correlation between the dollar index and S&P 500 index stood at 0.76. Also, the negative correlation between the dollar and crude oil stood at 0.73 in this period.

Rising commodity prices are one of the main reasons that are causing the persistently high inflation in the U.S. economy. If a higher dollar would help to lower the prices of commodities and import goods, it will be an efficient way to ease the rising inflation pressure. Hence, the Fed has valid reasons to be comfortable with its policy if it drives the greenback higher, though traders on Wall Street may not like it."
549,10 Key points from Xi's address to the UN General Assembly,"Chinese President Xi Jinping addressed the United Nations General Assembly Tuesday. Here are 10 points from his speech.

1. The history of world civilization is one of fighting pandemics. Rising to challenges, humanity has always emerged in triumph and achieved greater development and advancement. The current pandemic may appear overwhelming, but humanity will surely overcome it and prevail.

2. Staying committed to development as a priority:

“We need to put development high on the global macro policy agenda, strengthen policy coordination among major economies, and ensure policy continuity, consistency and sustainability. We need to foster global development partnerships that are more equal and balanced, forge greater synergy among multilateral development cooperation processes, and speed up the implementation of the U.N. 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.”

3. Staying committed to a people-centered approach:

“We should safeguard and improve people’s livelihoods and protect and promote human rights through development, and make sure that development is for the people and by the people, and that its fruits are shared among the people. We should continue our work so that the people will have a greater sense of happiness, benefit and security, and achieve well-rounded development.”

4. Staying committed to benefits for all:

“We should care about the special needs of developing countries. We may employ such means as debt suspension and development aid to help developing countries, particularly vulnerable ones facing exceptional difficulties, with emphasis on addressing unbalanced and inadequate development among and within countries.”

5. Staying committed to innovation-driven development:

“We need to seize the historic opportunities created by the latest round of technological revolution and industrial transformation, redouble efforts to harness technological achievements to boost productivity, and foster an open, fair, equitable and non-discriminatory environment for the development of science and technology. We should foster new growth drivers in the post-COVID era and jointly achieve leapfrog development.”

6. Staying committed to harmony between man and nature:

“We need to improve global environmental governance, actively respond to climate change and create a community of life for man and nature. We need to accelerate transition to a green and low-carbon economy and achieve green recovery and development.

China will strive to peak carbon dioxide emissions before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060. This requires tremendous hard work, and we will make every effort to meet these goals.

China will step up support for other developing countries in developing green and low-carbon energy, and will not build new coal-fired power projects abroad.”

7. Staying committed to results-oriented actions:“We need to increase input in development, advance on a priority basis cooperation on poverty alleviation, food security, COVID-19 response and vaccines, development financing, climate change and green development, industrialization, digital economy and connectivity, among other areas, and accelerate implementation of the U.N. 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, so as to build a global community of development with a shared future.

China has pledged an additional $3 billion of international assistance in the next three years to support developing countries in responding to COVID-19 and promoting economic and social recovery.”

8. “A world of peace and development should embrace civilizations of various forms, and must accommodate diverse paths to modernization. Democracy is not a special right reserved to an individual country, but a right for the people of all countries to enjoy.”

9. “One country’s success does not have to mean another country’s failure, and the world is big enough to accommodate common development and progress of all countries.”

10. “China is always a builder of world peace, contributor to global development, defender of the international order and provider of public goods. China will continue to bring the world new opportunities through its new development.”

A worker walks at the Hawassa Industrial Park in Hawassa town, 275 kilometers south of Addis Ababa, capital of Ethiopia, July 13, 2016. /Xinhua

Ethiopia's flagship Chinese-built Hawassa Industrial Park on Tuesday announced 114 million U.S. dollars revenue from the export of face masks to the international market.

The reported revenue was generated from the export of face masks mainly to the U.S. and European markets during the recently concluded Ethiopian fiscal year, state-run Ethiopian News Agency (ENA) quoted Fitsum Ketema, General Manager of Hawassa Industrial Park, as saying.

Despite the hardships created by the COVID-19 pandemic, companies operating inside the premises of the industrial park were able to mitigate the economic impact of the pandemic through the production and export of high-quality face-masks and related products, according to the general manager.

Hawassa Industrial Park, which the Ethiopian government considers as a model for the construction of other industrial zones across the country, has proved successful immediately after its inauguration in July 2016 by attracting various world-class textile and apparel companies to the East African country.

The industrial park was built by China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation (CCECC).

The Ethiopian government has previously disclosed its plan to generate close to 1 billion U.S. dollars in annual revenue from the park once it starts operations at its full potential.

As part of its efforts to make the country a light manufacturing hub and lower-middle income economy by 2025, the East African country hopes its plan to build and commission a total of 30 industrial parks within the same period."

Egypt's Suez Canal Authority (SCA) on Tuesday said the revenues of the canal in the first eight months of 2021 rose by 11.6 percent year on year to 4.09 billion U.S. dollars. /Xinhua

Egypt's Suez Canal Authority (SCA) on Tuesday said the revenues of the canal in the first eight months of 2021 rose by 11.6 percent year on year to 4.09 billion U.S. dollars.

Some 13,317 vessels crossed the canal from January to August in 2021 compared with 12,482 ships a year ago, up by 6.7 percent, the SCA said in a statement.

The increase in revenues came as the SCA has been implementing a plan to widen and deepen the southern part of the canal.

The Suez Canal is a major lifeline for global seaborne trade since it allows ships to travel between Europe and South Asia without navigating around Africa, thereby reducing the sea voyage distance by about 7,000 km.

Some 12 percent of the world trade volume passes through the man-made canal, a major source of hard currency in Egypt."
552,Troubled Evergrande's EV arm gives out share options to boost morale,"The electric vehicle (EV) arm of China's second largest developer Evergrande Group, which is currently under serious liquidity crisis, has given a total of 323.7 million share options to its directors and employees, said a filing on Tuesday.

Three independent non-executive directors and around 3,180 employees, mostly research and development staff, of China Evergrande New Energy Vehicle were granted the share options. They will be available to exercise from March 20 next year at HK$3.9 ($0.5) per share, 34 percent higher than the EV maker's closing share price HK$2.9 on Tuesday.

The company's share price was down 90.5 percent so far this year.

The share options, described by local media as a Mid-Autum Festival gift to Evergrande employees, are worth about HK$1.26 billion, equivalent to 3.31 percent of the capital of the company's current issued shares. China Evergrande New Energy Vehicle said it is to ""promote and support the company's development"" and ""ensure the interests of the group's long-term development stability."""
553,Honda says domestic output at 40% capacity in August-September,"Honda Motor said its car factories in Japan have been operating at 40 percent capacity in August and September because of shortages of semiconductors and other components caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

In a press release on its website, Honda said production should rebound to 70 percent capacity in early October.

""We are doing what we can to minimize the impact on production, but the situation remains unclear,"" the Japanese company said.

Models affected include the N-BOX, Fit and Odyssey, according to the release.

The release comes on the heels of Toyota Motor's announcement last Friday that 27 out of 28 lines across its 14 plants in Japan would be temporarily suspended for as many as 11 days in October, due to a shortage of components resulted from the resurgent pandemic.

Semiconductor shortages and the delayed packaging and testing of the chips will cause the production of global light vehicles to drop by 6.2 percent, or five million this year, London-based market research firm IHS Markit estimated last Thursday.

The pandemic-induced chip shortage has repeatedly halted auto plant operations and prompted them to scale back delivery targets since the end of 2020.

IHS Markit also downgraded the production forecast of global light vehicles by 9.3 percent to 82.6 million units in 2022, citing supply chain challenges.

554,China edges closer to top 10 most innovative economies: WIPO,"China is still the only middle-income economy in the list of the world's top 30 most innovative economies, establishing itself as a global innovation leader and approaching the top 10, according to a report released by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) on Monday.

WIPO's Global Innovation Index (GII) 2021 report shows that China has made continuous progress from ranking 14th last year to 12th this year and is now ""knocking at the door of the GII top 10,"" which ""underlines the continued importance of governmental policies and incentives to stimulate innovation.""

Since 2013, China has moved up the GII ranks consistently and steadily, establishing itself as a global innovation leader.

According to the GII, the number of China's patents by origin, scaled by GDP, is higher than those of Japan, Germany and the U.S., and is even more impressive when considered in absolute terms. The same is true for the number of trademarks and industrial designs by origin as a percentage of GDP.

In terms of innovation clusters geographically, the top 10 list remains the same as last year with only minor shifts. Shenzhen-Hong Kong-Guangzhou and Beijing now rank second and third, respectively, after the Tokyo-Yokohama cluster in Japan. Shanghai ranks eighth. Of the top 100 clusters, China has 19.

Published annually, the GII provides performance measures and ranks 132 economies on their innovation ecosystems. As in past years, Switzerland, Sweden, the U.S. and the UK continue to lead the innovation ranking. Other countries in the GII top 10 include South Korea, the Netherlands, Finland, Singapore, Denmark and Germany.

According to WIPO Director General Daren Tang, ""in spite of the massive impact of the COVID-19 pandemic ... many sectors have shown remarkable resilience, especially those that have embraced digitalization, technology and innovation.""

""As the world looks to rebuild from the pandemic, we know that innovation is integral to overcoming the common challenges that we face and to constructing a better future,"" he said."

U.S. airlines will benefit from the Biden administration's decision on Monday to reopen the country to fully-vaccinated air travelers from around the world, experts said, but the outlook for lucrative business travel was less certain. Lifting restrictions will allow tens of thousands of foreign nationals to fly to the United States. It also gives the big three air carriers, American Airlines, United Airlines and Delta Air Lines, a chance to recover part of their trans-Atlantic business. Moody's Investors Service estimates the White House decision would result in a ""stronger"" operating cash flow at U.S. airlines in the next six months. Trans-Atlantic flights accounted for 11 percent to 17 percent of their 2019 passenger revenues. Overall, international travel generated 26 percent to 38 percent of revenue for the three airlines in 2019, said Colin Scarola, vice president of equity research at CFRA Research.

Scarola added, ""The international category has been the one that really hasn't recovered much at all."" The lifting of restrictions coincides with the onset of the winter season, historically a lean period for international travel. Scarola said the decision would encourage companies to approve overseas business trips, yet the fight against COVID-19 was more important and he does not expect international travel to rebound to pre-pandemic levels before late 2022. CEO Doug Parker said American Airlines was ""looking forward to welcoming more customers back to easy, seamless international trips for business, for leisure, and to reconnect with family and friends."" In early September, U.S. airline passenger volumes for international travel were just 44 percent of the pre-pandemic levels, according to data from Airlines for America, an industry trade group.

Savanthi Syth, an analyst at Raymond James, called the White House's decision an ""incremental positive"" that would give U.S. carriers clarity for next year's summer travel season. Yet it did not prompt her to revise her financial estimates for them or the outlook for air travel. ""While this is a net positive, you have to kind of counterbalance it with what's happening in the U.S.,"" she said, referring to warnings from airlines this month about the financial hit from the fast-spreading Delta variant of the coronavirus. Several airlines have slashed revenue forecasts, citing a slowdown in bookings and increased cancellations. The resurgence in cases has also stalled a pickup in business travel, a cash cow for airlines with a round-trip business class ticket for a Chicago-New York United flight nearly triple the price of economy class. Syth expects domestic business travel to remain below the 2019 levels at least until late 2022. International business travel is not expected to recover before 2024, she said.

Democratic congressional leaders on Monday unveiled plans to suspend the nation's borrowing limit, following a White House warning of ""economic catastrophe"" unless that ceiling is raised.

The legislation also would fund the government through the end of the year after the current budget lapses on September 30.

But the fate of the plan is unclear since Republicans have vowed to withhold support for raising the debt ceiling, which is needed to fund spending already approved by lawmakers, including the massive rescue packages rolled out during the COVID-19 pandemic.

""The American people expect our Republican colleagues to live up to their responsibilities and make good on the debts they proudly helped incur,"" Democratic Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a joint statement.

They warned that ""a reckless Republican-forced default could plunge the country into a recession.""

Democrats have the majority in both houses of Congress, but the slim margin in the Senate means they will need some Republican support to push it through, since a single Senator can block any legislation that has less than 60 votes.

The measure would suspend the debt limit through December 2022 – after the mid-term congressional elections.

It also would keep the government running through the end of the year while legislators continue to debate two massive spending bills – an eight-year, $1.2 trillion infrastructure package and a 10-year, $3.5 trillion package with a host of social programs, largely paid for by rolling back tax cuts.

Schumer and Pelosi said the measure unveiled Monday would avoid ""an unnecessary government shutdown,"" and called it ""must-pass legislation.""

It will also include funds for disaster relief and Afghan evacuee resettlement, with the White House asking for $20 billion for hurricane and wildfire aid and $6 billion for tens of thousands of Afghan refugees.

""We look forward to passing this crucial legislation with bipartisan support through both chambers and sending to the president's desk in the coming weeks,"" they said.

But Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell once again said Democrats should go it alone.

""They just want bipartisan cover so they can pivot as fast as possible to ramming through an historically reckless taxing and spending spree on a pure party-line vote,"" he said on Twitter.

That is a stark contrast from his position in 2019, when Republican Donald Trump was president and McConnell argued that failing to raise the borrowing cap ""would be a disaster.""

U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has warned that without an increase the government will run out of cash to fund operations and pay its debts sometime in October.

Failing to raise the debt limit ""would produce widespread economic catastrophe"" and ""compound the damage of the continuing public health emergency,"" she said Monday."

558,Zimbabwe hopeful of hitting maize collection target,"Efforts by authorities in Zimbabwe to improve the country's food security are bearing fruit with the nation reporting a significant increase in deliveries of maize, a staple food crop in the country.

The Grain Marketing Board reported that more than 900,000 tonnes of maize had been delivered between April and September compared to just 138,000 tonnes during a similar period last year.

The board remains ""well on course"" to hit its target of 1.8 million tonnes given they are still receiving grain from farmers, according to the chief executive Rockie Mutenha. Zimbabwe's national production is currently estimated at around 2.8 million tonnes.

""The ongoing grain intake season is proceeding well compared to the same period last year,” Mutenha said.

Zimbabwe suffered a devastating drought last year which saw it produce 900,000 tonnes with 170,000 tonnes being delivered to the country's national granary.

Even though Zimbabwe may fail to achieve its target, some experts are not overly concerned about a possible food shortage situation as they believe several households have enough food stocks to carry them through to the next harvesting period.

Despite a slight drop in weekly deliveries, which are at about 50 percent, analysts argue that deliveries may be boosted by a good harvest season.

Another indicator of the improvement in grain supply is the fact that maize prices, which tend to surge during this period, according to local media, have remained largely stable.

Zimbabwe's agricultural sector has rebounded impressively after the challenges of last year's severe drought.

In July, senior officials in the cotton industry said they expected to exceed an initial projection of 150,000 tonnes of cotton produced this season making it the highest such yield in five years.

Last month, Finance Minister Mthuli Ncube said poultry production this year was expected to rebound from a decline in 2020 due to a successful crop season.

559,Expert: Shenzhen's Qianhai offers opportunities for HK,"China unveiled a plan earlier this month to further develop the Qianhai Shenzhen-Hong Kong Modern Service Industry Cooperation Zone.

The economic zone will reduce the barriers and transaction costs for individuals and financial institutions in Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland, said Bao Zhengyang, assistant professor from the school of finance at Xiamen University's department of economics.

The plan is set to promote the use of RMB for cross-border settlements and improve foreign exchange management and deepen cooperation in green finance among Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao through unified green finance standards. New mechanisms will also be set up for cross-border financial trading and international payments, according to the plan.

As the economic zone is set to provide better financial infrastructures, such as better payment methods like digital RMB and faster telecommunication technologies to attract financial innovations in the area, Bao said these will attract banks and financial companies from Hong Kong to set up offices in the zone.

Bao said that the financial sector in Hong Kong will benefit from economy of scale and positive spillover effect due to the expansion of the economic zone, as the Qianhai zone is expected to attract more investments and talents globally thanks to the strong policy support.

Bao is also expecting Qianhai economic zone to drive the integration of the Greater Bay Area, as the diversity in the economic zone calls for unification. The economic zone will also provide a platform for communications and collaborations, which in return facilitates unification.

However, he points out there are challenges to formulating a unified system, since Hong Kong and Macao use different currencies, have distinct financial laws and apply different exchange rate regimes.

Some suspect that the plan will bring negative effects to Hong Kong's status as a leading international financial center, but Bao said that the policy will strengthen Hong Kong’s leading role as a global financial center, as the expansion of the Qianhai zone lowers the barrier for investment and capital flows between China and the globe through different connect programs.

The policy will attract more foreign capital due to the favorable conditions, enhancing Hong Kong’s role as a center for capital exchange, said Bao. He added the Qianhai economic zone is an ideal incubator for financial innovations and FinTech developments, strengthening Hong Kong’s position as one of the most innovative financial centers."

562,Oil giant Shell sets sights on sustainable aviation fuel take-off,"Royal Dutch Shell plans to start producing low-carbon jet fuel at scale by 2025 to encourage the world's airlines to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

Aviation, accounting for 3 percent of the world's carbon emissions, is considered one of the toughest sectors to tackle due to a lack of alternative technologies to jet fueled-engines.

Shell, one of the world's largest oil traders, said it aims to produce 2 million tonnes of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) by 2025, a tenfold increase from today's total global output.

Produced from waste cooking oil, plants and animal fats, SAF could cut up to 80 percent of aviation emissions, Shell said.

Shell, which at present only supplies SAF produced by others, including Finnish refiner Neste, said on Monday it wants green jet fuel, which can be blended with regular aviation fuel with little need to change plane engines, to make up 10 percent of its global aviation fuel sales by 2030.

SAF accounts for less than 0.1 percent of today's global aviation fuel demand, which reached around 330 million tonnes in 2019, investment bank Jefferies said.

Growing the market faces several hurdles, primarily due to the cost of SAF, which is currently up to 8 times higher than regular jet fuel, and the limited availability of feedstock.

Shell plans to build a biofuels processing plant at its Rotterdam refinery with an annual capacity of 820,000 tonnes, with SAF set to make up more than half of the output. The plant is expected to start production in 2024.

In a new report on the decarbonisation of aviation published together with Deloitte, Shell called for the sector to cut its emissions to net zero by 2050."
563,Yellen: Debt default would 'permanently' weaken America,"U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen issued a fresh plea for Congress to raise the federal debt ceiling on Sunday, arguing a default on U.S. debt would trigger a historic financial crisis.

In a Wall Street Journal opinion piece, Yellen said the crisis triggered by a default would compound the damage from the continuing coronavirus pandemic, roiling markets and plunging the U.S. economy back into recession at the cost of millions of jobs and a lasting hike in interest rates.

""We would emerge from this crisis a permanently weaker nation,"" Yellen said, noting that the U.S.'s creditworthiness has been a strategic advantage.

Yellen did not offer a new timeline for a possible default, but described economic damage that would fall on consumers through higher borrowing costs and lower asset prices.

She has said previously that a default could come during October when the Treasury exhausts its cash reserves and extraordinary borrowing capacity under the $28.4 trillion debt limit.

""We can borrow more cheaply than almost any other country, and defaulting would jeopardize this enviable fiscal position. It would also make America a more expensive place to live, as the higher cost of borrowing would fall on consumers,"" Yellen wrote.

Republicans have refused to support raising or suspending the debt limit. U.S. Senator Bill Cassidy from Louisiana said earlier on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" program that Democrats want to increase the borrowing cap to fund trillions of dollars in ""Democratic wish list"" spending.

Yellen argued the debt ceiling is about paying for past spending obligations, and said waiting too long to lift the debt ceiling can still cause damage, citing a 2011 debt ceiling crisis that pushed the federal government to the brink of default that prompted a credit rating downgrade.

""This led to financial-market disruptions that persisted for months. Time is money here, potentially billions of dollars. Neither delay nor default is tolerable,"" she added."

The second-largest property giant in China, which had also been expanding its businesses to new energy cars and healthcare, has recently been hit by a liquidity crisis, with its liabilities mounting to over 1.97 trillion yuan ($304 billion), according to its half-year financial report released in late August.

The group has been struggling to raise funds to repay its many lenders and suppliers. It revealed in an exchange filing on Tuesday that it faces higher pressure on liquidity for the expected continuous fall in September, warning broader default risk.

China Evergrande expects plunging property sales in September to affect liquidity

The situation was exacerbated as investors gathered at Evergrande's headquarters in south China's Shenzhen demanding redemption of the company's wealth management products earlier this week.

In the Saturday statement, Evergrande Wealth said that their repayment work with property has begun and investors interested in redeeming wealth management products for physical assets should contact their investment consultants or visit the listed local offices across 27 provincial-level regions in China.

In a separate statement on Saturday, Evergrande said that six of its executives had redeemed 12 investment products in advance between May 1 and September 7 this year.

Evergrande said that it has requested these executives to return all the funds redeemed within a certain time frame, adding it will impose severe penalties on them.

The contract sales of properties of Evergrande amounted to 71.63 billion yuan in June, 43.78 billion yuan in July, and 38.08 billion yuan in August this year, showing a decreasing trend, according to the Tuesday filing.

Evergrande has also encountered repeated downgrades by international rating agencies in recent months, such as S&P Global Ratings and Fitch Ratings – both warning of the risk of default.

Evergrande's main unit, Evergrande Real Estate Group, applied on Thursday to suspend trading of its onshore corporate bonds following a downgrade from China's largest rating agency China Chengxin International (CCXI).

Its bonds were downgraded to A from AA, the second downgrade from CCXI in September.

More Chinese consumers have rushed to order the latest iPhone in 2021 than they did last year, according to South China Morning Post.

More than two million preorders for the new iPhone 13 had been placed on Apple's official store on Chinese retailer JD.com as of Thursday, according to a South China Morning Post report, surpassing the 1.5 million iPhone 12 pre-orders on the same platform in 2020.

Consumers are surprised the new iPhone 13 models were cheaper by about 300 to 800 yuan (about $45 to $125) than the corresponding iPhone 12 models. On Friday, when Apple's official preorders started, many Chinese consumers complained on social media platform Weibo that the Apple Chinese website was difficult to access, likely due to the surge in demand.

However, the booming orders didn't actively show on Apple's stock price, which closed down 1.83 percent on Friday. Its market value lost $45 billion from the previous trading day.

The ""winner-takes-all"" attribute of large financial technology companies may trigger a market monopoly and reduce innovation efficiency, said the top official of the People's Bank of China (PBOC).

The fast development of financial technology in China has helped its e-commerce, poverty alleviation and anti-pandemic measures, but it has also revealed problems such as payment institutions ""penetrating"" the financial sector, PBOC Governor Yi Gang said in a meeting on Tuesday.

Yi noted that all financial activities should be supervised and financial businesses must be operated with licenses.

568,Chinese city launches new freight train route to Poland,"A new China-Europe freight train route linking southwest China's Chengdu, capital of Sichuan Province, with the Polish port city of Gdansk, was launched Friday.

The first cargo train carrying goods such as furniture, household appliances, and machinery and equipment departed from Chengdu on Friday to Gdansk, the largest city and most important seaport in Poland's northern coastal region.

The successful launch of this route marks another extension of China-Europe freight train service from Chengdu into the hinterland of Europe. It is expected to help strengthen the economic, trade and cultural exchanges between China and Poland and other countries along the route, according to Chengdu International Railway Port Administrative Committee.

Chengdu has added eight new overseas stations to its China-Europe freight train routes so far this year. Its China-Europe freight trains can reach a total of 66 destinations in Europe.

The import volume registered 15.34 billion yuan during the period, increasing by 41.9 percent year on year, while that of the exports totaled 6.7 billion yuan, up 30.4 percent year on year, said the customs of Erenhot.

The rapid import growth shows China's steady economic recovery since the beginning of this year. Meanwhile, the rising trend of the global market price for bulk commodities is another factor driving the growth.

In terms of exports, the COVID-19 pandemic wreaked havoc on Mongolia's domestic production capacity, making it more dependent on imports from China. In the first eight months of this year, China's exports of mechanical and electrical products to Mongolia increased by 57.5 percent as a result of Mongolia's increasing demand for mine equipment.

Erenhot Port, the only railway port between China and Mongolia and a substantial channel for international cargo, has around 50 China-Europe freight train routes passing through it.

570,"Pet insurance demand rises, but growth not as fast as expected","Nine-year-old Baobao is not an expensive breed, but that hasn't stopped his owner from giving him all the love and attention.

Last year, Baobao's owner bought him a pet insurance – a little more than 800 yuan (about $124 dollars) a year – to cover common diseases and accidental injuries.

""Baobao caught Canine distemper when he was young and that cost me over 10,000 yuan (about $1,550 dollars). So, buying a pet insurance can help alleviate the financial pressure,"" said Baobao's owner Yan Ge.

Pet insurance compensates between 20 and 40 percent on average, of the medical payment. In fact, this type of insurance is not a new thing – it was first introduced in China in 2004.

The pet insurance industry has been growing in the Chinese market for nearly a decade. Though the demand exists, it is still relatively small.

In Zehang Pet Hospital in downtown Hangzhou, pets that have their own insurance only account for a minor proportion of the total number of pets that get treatment.

""Some 10 to 15 percent of the pets have insurance. Their owners are mostly young women,"" said Chen Hao, Head of Zehang Pet Hospital.

In Sweden, pet insurance coverage rate is deemed at 40 percent, the highest worldwide. However, the rate in China is only one percent. Chinese families are keeping more pets, but most of them know little about where and how to get such contracts.

Insurance companies are trying different methods to attract more customers. Last year, ZhongAn Online Insurance introduced a new technology to make it easier for people to buy insurance plans. Pet owners only need to upload their pets' pictures and the company will then set an ID for the pets by analyzing their nose print.

""Customers need to upload three photos – the pet's front face, full body and a picture of the owner with the animal. The accuracy rate of nose print detection is above 99 percent,"" said Li Shuang, product manager of ZhongAn Online Insurance.

Whether this strategy could further boost the demand remains a question. ZhongAn insurance's fiscal report shows that the premium of pet insurance grew by 60 times (annually) in the first half of 2021, serving more than one million pet owners. This figure is however still not ideal for China where 100 million pets currently live.

Making pet insurance popular in China may still take a long time."
571,"Wall Street slips on tech losses, tax uncertainty weighs","U.S. stock indexes slipped on Friday led by major technology firms, while uncertainty over higher corporate taxes and an upcoming Federal Reserve meeting also weighed on sentiment.

The Nasdaq was the worst performer among the main U.S. indexes and was set for its worst day since late July as a batch of strong economic readings encouraged investors to pivot into economically sensitive sectors and out of tech this week.

""(It was) a volatile week and a return to value outperformance as 'buy the dip' sentiments took hold, but not enough to rescind the recent market weakness,"" said Louise Dudley, global equities portfolio manager at the international business of Federated Hermes.

The three major indexes are now set for weekly losses, with the S&P 500 headed for its worst two-week performance since late February.

Concerns that a potential hike in corporate taxes could eat into earnings also weighed on markets, as leading Democrats sought to raise the top tax rate on corporations to 26.5 percent from the current 21 percent.

""We anticipate large cap volatility as changes to U.S. corporate tax rates play a role going forward as the two sides negotiate, particularly for the 'low tax' sectors implicated such as tech and biotech, and companies with hefty international revenues,"" Dudley said.

Focus is now on a meeting of the Federal Reserve next week, with investors debating if a batch of strong economic data this week could spur the bank into shortening its timeline for reducing monetary stimulus.

Thursday's data showing an unexpected rise in retail sales came on the heels of a steady factory activity reading and a cooling in inflation, suggesting the U.S. economic recovery was resilient despite a recent rise in cases of the Delta COVID-19 variant.

Treasury yields also rose on the data, indicating increased optimism over the economy as investors sold safe-haven bonds.

At 11:48 a.m. eastern time, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 168.97 points, or 0.49 percent , to 34,580.72, the S&P 500 lost 31.57 points, or 0.71 percent, to 4,442.18 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 146.08 points, or 0.96 percent, to 15,035.68.

Analysts said the S&P 500 was trading close to its 50-day moving average, which tends to be a big support for the index. Essentially, Friday's losses could lead to a rebound next week.

The simultaneous expiration of stock options, stock index futures and index options contracts later in the day, known as triple witching, is also expected to cause volatility through the trading session.

576,Carbon neutrality brings new opportunities for green finance,"Carbon-pricing mechanism is one of the new models China embraced as it pledged to reach peak emissions before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060, which ""will bring enormous opportunities in investment and earthshaking changes in financial business models,"" said Xiao Gang, former head of the China Securities Regulatory Commission.

It's been two months since China's first-ever carbon market began trading in July, replacing the EU's as the world's largest. As of September 16, the market's cumulative trading volume of the CarbonEmissions Allowance (CEA) was 8.4 million tonnes, with a cumulative turnover of 417 million yuan ($64 million).

So far, the market covers over 2,000 companies, mostly state-owned power and heat giants, which operate coal and gas plants. The market gives financial incentives to reduce their emissions. Basically, companies are allowed to purchase or sell carbon credits in the market, which are quotas or allowances for emissions generated during production.

With traditional industries trying desperately to reduce CO2 emissions in line with China's green drive, experts said new openings will inevitably appear in multiple sectors, for instance, wind and solar power, high quality manufacturing and innovative applications using carbon as a green material, which can inspire China to achieve its climate goals.

Although market-oriented trading, using carbon as a commodity, has the potential to efficiently reduce emissions whilst still achieving high-quality growth, some argued the responsibility of cutting carbon emissions should not fall solely on corporations.

""One resident produces about 10 tonnes of carbon emissions every year. So, we could set a bar and charge taxes if the emissions exceed this number, or give stipends when they are lower,"" said Ju Jiandong, director of the research center for green finance development at the PBC School of Finance, a joint venture between Tsinghua University and the People's Bank of China.

Ju said China's carbon market is still in a phase with room to grow in sectors including legislation and pricing. He pointed out that the EU's program has a turnover ratio – a key indicator of a stock's liquidity – 80 times that of China's number and with a price roughly 10 times of China's CEA prices.

""If the market should fall short of expectation to efficiently boost development to reach carbon neutrality, we may as well count on the tax measures,"" said the director."" The tax is already active in Europe and Canada, some other Asian countries including Singapore and Japan. India is expected to levy the tax in 2022. But so far, China hasn't implemented this tax.""

China has made tremendous efforts on its green shift of economic and social development. In 2019, China's carbon emission intensity dropped by 48 percent compared with 2015, according to a report last year by the State Information Office.

Experts said it will not be easy to find the best way forward but hopefully the country may ultimately reshape the nature of key industries, economies and lifestyles for a greener future."
577,Light vehicle production to drop 6.2% in 2021 on chip delays: IHS,"Semiconductor shortages and the delayed packaging and testing of the chips will cause production of global light vehicles to drop by 6.2 percent, or five million this year, London-based market research firm IHS Markit estimated on Thursday.

The pandemic-induced chip shortage has repeatedly halted auto plant operations and prompted them to scale back delivery targets since the end of 2020.

IHS Markit also downgraded the production forecast of global light vehicles by 9.3 percent to 82.6 million units in 2022, citing supply chain challenges.

Packaging and testing operations within the semiconductor sector in Malaysia were impacted due to the government's lockdown measures in early June, IHS said, compounding difficulties in an already constrained supply chain.

""Our interpretation of the situation in Malaysia, which is responsible for 13 percent of the global supply of semiconductors for the automotive industry, has become more pessimistic,"" IHS said.

Toyota, the world's largest automaker, recently announced that it would cut global auto production by 40 percent in September amid a chip crunch worsened by a COVID-19 resurgence in key Asian semiconductor production hubs.

Explainer: What caused the chip shortage?

IHS said the semiconductor snafus have resulted in lost production of 3.1 million units in the third quarter, nearly double its previous forecast.

""The outlook for Q4 now reflects heightened risk as challenges to the supply chain – primarily semiconductors – remain entrenched.""

He also stressed openness and inclusiveness and the need to actively explore the alignment of rules and systems of Guangdong and Macao.

He urged Guangdong and Macao to strengthen cooperation and steadily improve the new mechanism of extensive consultation, joint contribution, joint management, and shared benefits.

New industries in new space

Hengqin, which is located in the southern part of Zhuhai City in Guangdong Province, is the city's largest island and just five minutes by shuttle bus from Macao.

Hengqin free trade zone was set up in 2015 and the island later became a key hub for the Greater Bay Area.

By the end of 2020, the once-remote island had become a modern city with a total GDP of 46.8 billion yuan, according to official data.

The plan defines the cooperation zone, which covers a total area of 106 square kilometers, three times the size of Macao, as a new platform to boost the special administrative region's economic diversification, and a new space to facilitate Macao residents' life and employment.

Macao's small space limited the development of many industries, therefore Macao asked the central government for additional land in Hengqin and received permission, Chief Executive of Macao Ho Iat Seng said in an interview with China Media Group broadcast on September 12.

As the world's gambling hub, Macao's single economic structure made it vulnerable to turbulences such as the pandemic. Official data showed that its GDP shrank by 56.23 percent year on year in 2020 when tourist numbers dropped 80 percent compared to 2019.

The over-dependence on gambling and tourism also discourages young people from joining promising industries such as technology.

The cooperation zone plan is designed to solve these problems by promoting four major industries, including tech and high-end manufacturing; traditional Chinese medicine and other signature businesses of Macao; industries related to culture, tourism, conventions, exhibitions, business and trade and also modern finance, especially with Portuguese-speaking countries.

To encourage talents and businesses to join the cooperation zone, generous tax cuts and other preferential policies are offered.

The enterprise income tax rate will be 15 percent for companies in Hengqin, compared with the normal 20-25 percent on the Chinese mainland. Personal income tax for Macao residents working in Hengqin will be the same as the rate in Macao, which is lower than the rate on the Chinese mainland.

New management structure

As an integration platform, the Hengqin zone adopts a co-management system.

Ma Xingrui, the governor of Guangdong, and Macao's chief executive Ho have been appointed as the co-leaders of the Hengqin zone administration committee, which will make major decisions on plans, policies and personnel appointments.

Under the administration committee, there is an executive committee responsible for business promotion, land development and project operation. The executive committee will be led by officials appointed by the Macao SAR government and participated in by officials from Guangdong and Zhuhai.

The management mechanism showed that the Hengqin zone will fully consider Macao's needs and requests, according to a research note from China Merchants Securities.

580,Bad weather in Brazil means more expensive coffee in Shanghai,"As extreme weather this year has damaged coffee bean crops in the world's largest coffee bean producer Brazil, coffee beans supplies are tightening up, which has put the price of coffee beans up to a six-year high and added costs to coffee shop owners in China, one of the world's largest consumption markets for coffee.

Coffee bean prices have been going up since last November when Brazil had a drought, said Shang Wentao, general manager of S.Ishimitsu & Co. (Shanghai).

""And then in July, the country had severe frosts, which further stoked the price increase. The futures price for Arabica coffee beans has been surging from $1.6 a pound since July 21, once hitting $2.15 a pound. The business is going to be hit by Brazil's production situation, as it accounts for a third of all the beans. Analysts have lowered estimates for Brazil coffee bean production by 20 percent,"" said Shang.

""The most important events were severe frosts in Brazil in July, and that impact will last for two or three years,"" said Jose Sette, executive director of International Coffee Organization, as he explained the reasons for the sharp increase in coffee bean prices.

Besides extreme weather, labor shortages and COVID-19 related logistics problems aggravate the production bottleneck of Brazil's coffee beans.

""The price to move a container from Vietnam, which is the world second largest coffee producer, kept rising. Before the pandemic, the price to move from Vietnam to developed countries like Europe or North America used to be $800, now it is $8,000. We can also see this similar situation in Brazil,"" said Sette.

Sette, also said coffee retailers will eventually pass on price increases to consumers, but by how much depends on the price elasticity of demand between markets.

The surge in prices is likely to affect coffee enthusiasts beginning next year, Shang said."

Many foreign firms have reaffirmed that they would stay in the city, said Edward Yau Tang-Wah, Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development Bureau.

In 2019, there were about 1,541 regional headquarters of foreign companies settled in Hong Kong. That number declined slightly to 1,504 last year, according to the figures released by the Census and Statistics Department of the HKSAR government.

Meanwhile, regional offices in Hong Kong of foreign firms dropped from 2,490 to 2,479, but the number of foreign firms setting up local offices in the city increased from 5,009 to 5,042.

Yau said Hong Kong recognized the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the long-term impact of the China-U.S. trade dispute on Hong Kong. He said the city would need time to get its economy back to its previous level. The total value of Hong Kong's trade stood at $111.7 billion in July of 2021, with an increase of 26.9 percent year-on-year in its total exports and 26.1 percent year-on-year in its total imports, according to official data.

China's National Development and Reform Commission issues a plan to improve the country's ""dual control system"" on energy consumption and energy intensity, September 11, 2021. /CFP

China will firmly control energy-hungry and high-emission projects, the National Development and Reform Commission said in a recently issued plan, according to a notice released on Thursday.

The plan aims to improve China's ""dual control system"" on energy consumption and energy intensity, or the amount of energy consumed per unit of GDP.

The dual control system, first set in the country's 11th Five-Year Plan (2006-2010), has taken on added significance since Chinese President Xi Jinping in September 2020 committed the country to peaking carbon emissions by 2030 and becoming carbon neutral by 2060.

According to the plan, China will set a five-year target of energy consumption and energy intensity for different provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities, in an effort to reasonably manage indicators of total energy consumption and energy intensity.

The plan also clarified a series of phased goals of China.

By 2025, the dual control system will be more complete, with a more reasonable allocation of energy resources and sharply improved energy utilization efficiency.

By 2030, with a further improved dual control system, the intensity of energy consumption will continue to drop significantly, the total energy consumption be reasonably controlled and the energy structure be more optimized.

By 2035, the optimal allocation of energy and the comprehensive conservation system of resources will be more mature and finalized, which will strongly support the achievement of the goal of steadily reducing carbon emissions after reaching the peak."

As China's new energy vehicle sector enters a new development stage, the country will accelerate R&D and industrialization of key technologies, such as automotive chips and operating systems, while coping with challenges and embracing opportunities, Chinese Vice Premier Han Zheng said on Thursday.

China is the largest producer and consumer of cars and has ranked first worldwide for the six consecutive years in production and sales volume, Han said while addressing the 2021 World New Energy Vehicle Congress (WNEVC) via a video link.

The three-day WNEVC, themed ""Comprehensively promoting marketization, accelerating cross-industry integration, jointly achieving carbon neutrality,"" kicked off on September 15 in Haikou, capital of south China's Hainan Province.

In recent years, China has made efforts to develop the NEVs industry to meet the country's goals of a carbon peak by 2030 and achieving carbon neutrality nationwide by 2060.

China has formed an effective industrial chain of the NEVs industry, with leading technology of key components and parts, Han said.

Besides technological innovation, Han also stressed adhering to the market-driven strategy while China improves the industrial management and supportive policies.

China will speed up infrastructure construction, promote public and private consumption of NEVs, and continue to expand the scale of NEVs application, he added."
588,China Evergrande onshore bond trading suspended after downgrade,"China Evergrande Group's main unit, Hengda Real Estate Group, applied on Thursday to suspend trading of its onshore corporate bonds following a downgrade, as the country's second-largest property developer wrestles with a liquidity crisis.

The application follows repeated trading freezes of the bonds in recent days by the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges as a result of volatile trading.

Hengda said it had applied to suspend trade of its onshore corporate bonds for one day. On the resumption of trade on Friday, its Shanghai and Shenzhen exchange-traded bonds will only be traded through negotiated transactions.

The company's January 2023 Shenzhen-traded bond was last quoted at 24.99 yuan ($3.88) on Wednesday, and its Shanghai-traded May 2023 bond traded at 30 yuan.

Hengda received notice on Wednesday from the country's largest rating agency China Chengxin International (CCXI) that the bonds' ratings had been downgraded to A from AA, and that both the bonds' ratings and its issuer rating were put on a watch list for further downgrades.

CCXI's downgrade of the developer was its second this month. A downgrade of Evergrande and its onshore bonds to AA from AAA on September 2 resulted in the bonds being made ineligible for pledged repo trading.

S&P Global Ratings this week further downgraded Evergrande to ""CC"" from ""CCC.""

Evergrande is scrambling to raise funds for its total liabilities of more than $300 billion.

The People's Bank of China and the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission issued a joint statement in August, saying that they had summoned the developer's executives and urged them to reduce the group's debt risks and prioritize stability.

The regulatory talks came amid concerns that any financial crisis at Evergrande could pose a potential systemic risk to the economy.

589,UNCTAD: Global economy will bounce back with 5.3% growth in 2021,"The global economy will bounce back with growth of 5.3 percent this year, the fastest rate in nearly 50 years, according to the Trade and Development Report 2021 released by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) on Thursday.

The rebound is thanks to the continuation of radical policy interventions began in 2020 and a successful vaccine rollout in advanced economies, the report said.

However, the recovery is highly uneven across geographical, income and sectoral lines.

In developed economies, the rentier class has seen an explosion in wealth, while low-earners struggle. For developing economies, due to lack of monetary autonomy and access to vaccines, their economies are held back, and their gulf with developed economies is widened.

""These widening gaps, both domestic and international, are a reminder that underlying conditions, if left in place, will make resilience and growth luxuries enjoyed by fewer and fewer privileged people,"" said Rebeca Grynspan, the secretary-general of UNCTAD.

Global growth is expected to slow to 3.6 percent in 2022, leaving world income 3.7 percent below where its pre-pandemic trend would have put it. Cumulative income loss is expected to be $13 trillion in 2020-2022.

Many countries in the South, most notably in Africa and South Asia, have been hit much harder than during the global financial crisis, while their now heavier debt burden reduces their room for fiscal policy.

International trade has recovered after the overall flow dropped 5.6 percent last year. It is projected that real growth of global trade will be 9.5 percent in 2021.

But global output will only resume its trend in 2016-2019 by 2030 even barring significant setbacks."

The logos of (clockwise from top left) Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon. /CFP

U.S. antitrust regulators signaled Wednesday greater scrutiny of Big Tech giants' smaller acquisitions, a potential new avenue in efforts to curb the dominance of the companies.

Google's parent Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft carried out hundreds of deals in recent years that were too small to be reported to authorities for approval, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) heard at its meeting.

Commissioner Rebecca Slaughter said regulators need this type of broader perspective, and that reviewing acquisitions individually was insufficient.

""I think of serial acquisitions as a Pac-Man strategy: each individual merger, viewed independently, may not seem to have a significant impact,"" her prepared comments said.

""The collective impact of hundreds of smaller acquisitions can lead to a monopolistic behemoth.""

She spoke as the commission heard findings from a study launched in February last year into over 600 acquisitions by the tech titans from 2010 to 2019, some of which were below the threshold for reporting.

Appointments to the FTC and the Department of Justice in U.S. President Joe Biden's administration have signaled ramped up antitrust enforcement, amid calls by some to break up some of the biggest and most successful Big Tech firms.

FTC has filed suit against Facebook, alleging it used ""anti-competitive acquisitions"" of potential rivals such as Instagram and WhatsApp to protect its dominance.

Additionally, the Justice Department's antitrust division said it is working with the commission to carefully review its guidelines on ""harmful mergers"" such as big firms gobbling up small operators in markets.

""The Department of Justice is conducting a careful review of the Horizontal Merger Guidelines and the Vertical Merger Guidelines to ensure they are appropriately skeptical of harmful mergers,"" acting attorney general Richard Powers said in a release.

FTC chair Lina Khan noted Big Tech companies have devoted ""tremendous resources"" on acquisitions that are ""largely outside of our purview.""

""This study underscores the need for us to closely examine reporting requirements... and to identify areas where the FTC may have created loopholes that are unjustifiably enabling deals to fly under the radar.""

Facebook in July filed a formal request calling for the recusal of Khan in any antitrust action against the social media giant, arguing that she is biased and cannot rule impartially.

The move follows a similar request from Amazon in anticipation of a wave of antitrust enforcement action against Big Tech firms from the regulatory agency under its leader appointed by Biden."

Food delivery giants Meituan and Alibaba Group's Ele.me both emphasized this week they will not force delivery drivers to register as independent businesses, a bone of contention amid China's ongoing scrutiny of the sector.

Many drivers for food delivery or ride-hailing apps are hired indirectly by the platform and do not receive basic social or medical insurance.

A social media account covering labor law published an article this week alleging some drivers working for Meituan and Ele.me were operating as individual businesses, as opposed to employees of the platform or a third-party company, thereby reducing the platform company's legal obligations to the driver. The piece spread widely across China's internet.

In a social media post published late on Tuesday, Meituan wrote that it aimed to improve its treatment of riders in aspects such as income, social security, and health and safety.

Ele.me published a statement on Wednesday pledging not to force drivers to register as independent businesses.

The promise comes as part of a broader push from regulators to improve conditions for ""gig-economy"" workers.

Chinese regulators gathered 10 leading delivery and ride-hailing companies for a meeting last week to give guidance on better-protecting labor rights. The meeting focused on improving how platform firms distributed incomes and ensured rest periods for workers.

Regulators drafted guidelines in July urging food delivery platforms to guarantee their workers' income was above the local minimum wage.

The July guideline also said that platforms and third-party contractors should participate in social insurance programs for the delivery drivers they employ.

598,China to launch Southbound Bond Connect on Sept. 24,"China will officially launch its long-awaited Southbound Bond Connect on September 24, the latest step to deepen financial cooperation between the mainland and Hong Kong, regulators said on Wednesday.

The connection will enable Chinese mainland institutional investors to invest in the Hong Kong bond market, according to a joint statement by the People's Bank of China and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.

The new arrangement comes four years after the Northbound Bond Connect, which allows overseas investors to trade bonds on the Chinese mainland, was established in July 2017.

The completion of the two-way connection of the bond markets will promote further mutual access between the two financial markets and reinforce Hong Kong's status as an international financial center, said Carrie Lam, the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.

According to Lam, the Northbound Bond Connect with foreign holding of mainland onshore bonds increased from about 880 billion yuan ($136.8 billion) in 2017 to 3.8 trillion yuan as of August this year.

Currently, domestic institutional investors are allowed to invest in offshore securities and bonds within quotas under the Qualified Domestic Institutional Investor (QDII), which was launched in 2006.

The bond connection is also seen as an effort to further interlink the country's Greater Bay Area (GBA), including southern China's Guangdong Province, Hong Kong and Macao Special Administrative Regions.

599,"Farm subsidies have failed to curb hunger, emissions, says UN","Nearly 90 percent of subsidies provided to the agriculture sector worldwide harm the environment, distort the pricing of produce and fail to curb hunger, a new report revealed on Tuesday.

More than $470 million out of $540 billion subsidies provided to the sector are invested in manufacturing unhealthy products, like sugar and emission-intensive commodities, such as beef, milk and rice, said a report by the United Nations .

While high and middle-income countries consume milk and meat in bulk, leaving behind a significant carbon footprint, farmers in developing countries struggle to get minimal incentives to grow nutritious food.

Without reforms, the report calculated, the subsidies could triple to $1.75 trillion annually by 2030, exacerbating pollution, intensifying food insecurity and widening the gender disparity further.

""Governments have an opportunity now to transform agriculture into a major driver of human well-being, and into a solution for the imminent threats of climate change, nature loss, and pollution,"" said Inger Andersen, executive director of the UN Environment Program.

As agriculture contributes nearly a quarter of the total global greenhouse gas emissions, environmentalists advocate for the effective utilization of the subsidy. They discourage support for the export of produce, which benefits a handful of producers and leads to price disparity in the domestic market.

Despite lucrative subsidies doled out to the sector, countries have failed to supply enough food to eradicate hunger. As a result, more than 800 million people worldwide faced chronic hunger last year, and 2.37 billion people could not get enough food throughout the year.

Reconfiguring agricultural produce support, rather than eliminating it, will help end poverty, eradicate hunger, achieve food security, improve nutrition, promote sustainable agriculture, foster sustainable consumption and production, mitigate the climate crisis, restore nature, limit pollution, and reduce inequalities, the report said.

The report comes as governments prepare for negotiations at the 2021 Food Systems Summit in September, COP15 on biodiversity in October and COP26 on climate change in November.

Qu Dongyu, director-general of the Food and Agriculture Organization, said: ""This report, released on the eve of the UN Food Systems Summit, is a wake-up call for governments around the world to rethink agricultural support schemes to make them fit for purpose to transform our agri-food systems and contribute to the Four Betters: Better nutrition, better production, better environment and a better life.""

But a few countries have already taken action to deal with the issue. For example, the report highlighted China's reform of agricultural policies in 2006 to reduce mineral fertilizers and chemical pesticides. The rampant use of chemicals in farming causes soil pollution, and run-off water pollutes the local water bodies.

Researchers pointed out a ""one-size-fits-all approach"" cannot be applied to farm subsidies. They recommended a six-pronged approach to deal with the issue. They encouraged governments to measure the support provided, understand its positive and negative impacts, and identify repurposing options.

Forecasting the impacts of subsidies, refining the proposed strategy, detailing its implementation plan, and monitoring the implemented strategy have also been strongly encouraged.

601,U.S. inflation coming off the boil as prices increase slowly in August,"Underlying U.S. consumer prices increased at their slowest pace in six months in August as used motor vehicle prices tumbled, suggesting that inflation had probably peaked, though it could remain high for a while amid persistent supply constraints.

The broad slowdown in price pressures reported by the Labor Department on Tuesday aligns with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's long-held belief that high inflation is transitory. Still, economists cautioned it was too early to celebrate and expected the U.S. central bank to lay out plans in November to start scaling back its massive monthly bond-buying program.

The consumer price index (CPI), excluding the volatile food and energy components, edged up 0.1 percent last month. That was the smallest gain since February and followed a 0.3-percent rise in July.

""Inflation remains troublingly strong, even if it is not exploding like it did earlier in the year,"" said James McCann, deputy chief economist at Aberdeen Standard Investments in Boston. ""If we continue to see further step-downs in inflation over the next six months, that should ease the pressure on the Fed to quickly follow tapering with interest rate rises.""

The so-called core CPI was held back by a 1.5-percent decline in prices for used cars and trucks, which ended five straight monthly increases. Robust rises in prices of used cars and trucks as well as services in industries worst affected by the COVID-19 pandemic were the key drivers behind a heating up of inflation at the start of the year.

Airline fares plunged by 9.1 percent in August, likely as a resurgence in infections, driven by the Delta variant of the coronavirus, sapped demand for air travel. There were also decreases in motor vehicle rentals and insurance.

In the 12 months through August, the core CPI increased by 4 percent after advancing 4.3 percent in the 12 months through July. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the core CPI would gain 0.3 percent for the month and increase by 4.2 percent year on year.

Stocks on Wall Street were trading lower. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose.

Supply constraints remain

In addition to the price surge for used cars and trucks appearing to have run its course, hotel and motel accommodation prices are now above the pre-pandemic level, suggesting moderate gains ahead.

Prices for hotels and motels accommodation fell by 3.3 percent after shooting up 6.8 percent in July. Some of the price plunge was probably because of the soaring coronavirus infections.

But bottlenecks in the supply chain remain and the labor market is tightening, pushing up wages. There were a record 10.9 million job openings as of the end of July, forcing companies to boost wages as they compete for workers."

China's retail sales of consumer goods rose 2.5 percent in August from a year earlier, far below market expectations, while value-added industrial output went up 5.3 percent year on year, both slowing from July due to new COVID-19 outbreaks, official data (link in Chinese) showed Wednesday. Retail sales registered the slowest growth since August 2020, a sharp drop from the 8.5 percent in July, according to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), putting the average two-year growth at 1.5 percent. The figure in August was far below the projection of a 7-percent rise by both Reuters and Bloomberg.

Notably, the catering industry saw revenue fall 4.5 percent in August compared with a year ago and contrasts with 14.3-percent growth in sales in July.

The growth of industrial output in August narrowed from 6.4-percent in July and saw an average two-year growth of 5.4 percent, according to NBS. The August figure missed expectations for a 5.8-percent growth by both Reuters and Bloomberg.

However, high-tech manufacturing grew by 18.3 percent year on year, 2.7 percentage points faster than July. The output of new energy vehicles, industrial robots and integrated circuits went up by 151.9 percent, 57.4 percent and 39.4 percent from a year earlier respectively. ""In August, the national economy maintained the trend of recovery. However, we must be aware that the international environment is still complicated and severe,"" the NBS statement said. ""At home, it has been felt that the sporadic outbreak of COVID-19 and natural disasters such as floods had caused an impact on the economy, and the foundation for the economic recovery still needs to be consolidated.""

Fixed asset investment, a gauge of expenditures on items including infrastructure, property, machinery and equipment, increased 8.9 percent in the first eight months. The figure was against Reuters' expectation of 9 percent and compared with a 10.3-percent jump in the January-July period. August data ""were all below consensus forecasts for a consecutive month, confirming our view that markets have significantly underestimated the scale of the growth slowdown in the second half of the year,"" Lu Ting, chief China economist at Nomura, said in a note. Nomura sees three major growth headwinds in coming months: COVID-19 and China's ""zero-COVID"" strategy, the country's unprecedented tightening measures on the property sector and exceptionally aggressive measures to curb carbon emissions. ""We expect markets to cut their GDP growth forecasts for the third quarter and fourth quarter further,"" said Lu. The current consensus forecasts are at 5.6 percent and 4.7 percent respectively, versus Nomura's 5.1 percent and 4.4 percent respectively. The surveyed jobless rate remained unchanged from July and stood at 5.1 percent in August, according to the NBS. China has set a target of a 5.5 percent unemployment rate for the whole year."
603,China sees fewer air trips amid COVID-19 resurgence,"China's civil aviation industry saw a decline in the number of air trips and volume of mail and cargo in August amid a recent resurgence of COVID-19, official data showed Tuesday.

About 22.41 million passenger trips were made last month, a decrease of 51.5 percent from a year earlier, according to statistics released by the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) at a press conference.

The number of trips is about 36.6 percent of that recorded in the same period in 2019, the CAAC said.

The volume of mail and cargo transported stood at 520,000 tonnes, down 5.6 percent year on year, while the total air transport turnover dropped by 35.6 percent year on year to 4.91 billion tonne-km, according to the CAAC.

The eastern province of Jiangsu, where China's recent COVID-19 resurgence first emerged, last week announced that it has cleared all high- and medium-risk areas.

Despite being restrained by recent COVID-19 cases, air travel demand is expected to be unleashed during the upcoming Mid-Autumn Festival holiday and the National Day holiday, CAAC official Shang Kejia said.

As the latest booking data from online travel agencies showed, the number of air passenger trips will rise notably during the two holidays from the July-August level, Shang said.

To meet the growing demand, the CAAC will help airlines better plan transport capacity, schedules and air routes. It has also advised several airlines to increase the number of flights for the holidays.

This year's Mid-Autumn Festival holiday lasts from September 19 to 21, while the National Day break runs from October 1 to 7."

The International Finance Corporation (IFC), the private sector arm of the World Bank, on Tuesday announced the launch of a competition to stimulate growth of businesses in Kakuma and Kalobeyei refugee camps in northern Kenyan county of Turkana.

IFC said in a statement released in Nairobi, the Kenyan capital, the competition that runs from Sept. 14 to Nov. 5 encourages businesses to submit proposals for funding and training aimed at facilitating their growth.

Other entities supporting the Local Enterprise Development Competition include Nairobi-based non-profit group, Africa Enterprise Challenge Fund (AECF), Turkana county government and UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR).

The broader goal of the contest is to support private sector development and job creation in the vast and drought-prone Turkana County, empower refugees and host communities.

""This competition demonstrates IFC's commitment to local businesses in Kenya and our efforts to uplift host communities and refugees with private sector solutions,"" said Jumoke Jagun-Dokunmu, IFC's regional director for Eastern Africa.

Jagun-Dokunmu noted that Kakuma refugee camp and the adjacent region has untapped business potential that requires adequate funding and training to unlock and create new jobs for the youth.

Overseen by Kakuma Kalobeyei Challenge Fund (KKCF) which is a joint initiative of IFC and AECF, the Local Enterprise Development Competition focuses on market-led solutions to economic and social challenges facing refugees and their host communities.

Winners of the contest will be announced in early 2022 and will leverage new funding and capacity development to expand their businesses, transform the lives of refugees.

AECF's CEO Victoria Sabula said the competition targets small and medium-sized enterprises owned and operated by residents of Turkana county including refugees. The competition will pay special attention to businesses owned by women and youth that require capital injection to expand their geographical reach as they generate employment.

The winners of the third edition of Local Enterprise Development Competition will receive performance-based grants ranging from 1.5 million shillings (about 13,648 U.S. dollars) to 5 million shillings besides advisory support focusing on marketing, financial management and publicity."

The World Bank on Tuesday projected Somalia's economy to grow at 2.4 percent in 2021. /Xinhua

The World Bank on Tuesday projected Somalia's economy to grow at 2.4 percent in 2021, rebounding from the ""triple shock"" that ravaged the country in 2020 -- COVID-19, flooding, and the locust infestation.

In its latest Economic Update, the World Bank said this growth momentum is expected to continue in the medium term and reach pre-COVID-19 levels of 3.2 percent in 2023.

""As Somalia embarks on the road to recovery from the triple shocks, policy interventions that raise productivity, create jobs and expand pro-poor programs will be key,"" said Kristina Svensson, the World Bank country manager for Somalia, during the virtual launch of the report.

According to the report, the economy of Somalia contracted 0.4 percent in 2020, less severe than the 1.5 percent contraction projected at the onset of the global pandemic.

Higher-than-anticipated aid flows, fiscal policy measures put in place by the government to aid businesses, social protection measures to cushion vulnerable households, and higher-than-expected remittance inflows mitigated the adverse effects of the triple shock.

And the disruptions stemming from COVID-19 containment measures reduced federal and state revenue collection while increasing pressure to spend more on health and disaster relief, said the report, noting large increases in external grants enabled the government to begin rebalancing public spending toward economic and social services and to provide funds for new social programs and emergency response projects to increase resilience.

John Randa, World Bank senior economist, said support for the health sector is an essential component of resilient and inclusive development and investing in health sets Somalia on a path to reaping substantial demographic dividends from improvements in life expectancy and reductions in fertility.

The lender said interventions to improve the investment climate and encourage the formalization of businesses to attract more private investment would include reforms focused on reducing the cost of electricity and improving on its reliability, leveling the playing field among private firms, reducing red tape, and broadening financial inclusion."

609,China's first batch produced C919 jet to enter final assembly,"China's first batch production of the C919 passenger plane is set to enter its final assembly, said the country's aviation regulator on Monday.

The phased progress marks a milestone in the C919 program since the batch production of the aircraft launched in 2019, the East China Regional Administration of the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) said on its official WeChat account.

The C919 program's Production Certificate Board (PCB) met in Shanghai on September 10 and reviewed the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China's (COMAC) reports on batch producing the jet, the CAAC said.

The first of five homemade jetliners is expected to be delivered to China Eastern Airlines by the end of the year.

COMAC won its first-ever commercial contract for the C919 in March.

The regulators said the PCB has also approved proposals to adjust the current plans to obtain the aircraft's production certificate, which is required for mass production.

A part of China's drive to develop homemade civil airplanes, the C919 is expected to compete with medium-range aircraft from the two global giants, such as Airbus A320 and Boeing 737 MAX."
610,"China Evergrande expects property sales fall, liquidity deterioration","China's leading developer China Evergrande said it expects a ""significant continuing decline in contract sales"" in September in an exchange filing on the progress of recent measures to ease liquidity on Tuesday.

September is typically when real estate companies in China record higher contract sales of properties, the group said in the filing with the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong.

However, ""the ongoing negative media reports concerning the group have dampened the confidence of potential property purchasers in the group,"" it added.

With the expected further decline in September sales, it will thereby result in ""the continuous deterioration of cash collection by the group, which would in turn place tremendous pressure on the group's cash flow and liquidity,"" Evergrande said.

According to the filing, the contract sales of properties of the indebted group amounted to 71.63 billion yuan (about $11.1 billion) in June, 43.78 billion yuan in July, and 38.08 billion yuan in August this year, showing a decreasing trend.

The group also said measures it has taken to ease the liquidity issues have not reached expected outcomes, including no material progress made on the sales of part of China Evergrande New Energy Vehicle Group Ltd. and Evergrande Property Services Group Ltd.

Broader default risk

In the filing, Evergrande said two of its subsidiaries had failed to uphold guarantee obligations for 934 million yuan worth of wealth management products issued by third parties.

That could ""lead to cross-default"", which ""would have a material adverse effect on the group's business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations,"" it said.

Evergrande said it has appointed Houlihan Lokey and Admiralty Harbour Capital as joint financial advisers, which will assess the group's capital structure, evaluate its liquidity, explore solutions to ease the current liquidity stress and reach an optimal solution for all stakeholders as soon as possible.

In a statement on Monday, Evergrande refuted online discussion about a bankruptcy and said a restructuring of the company was ""totally untrue"", but added that it has ""indeed encountered unprecedented difficulties.""

S&P Global Ratings downgraded Evergande's rating to ""CCC"" in August, just two weeks after another earlier downgrade.

In July, China's largest rating agency, China Chengxin International Credit Rating, downgraded Evergrande's outlook to ""negative.""

Evergrande is the second-largest property developer in China, according to the China Real Estate Association's 2021 ranking.

612,South Korea fines Google $177m for abusing market dominance,"South Korea's antitrust regulator on Tuesday fined Alphabet's Google 207 billion won ($176.64 million), saying the U.S. technology giant abused its dominant market position to restrict competition in the mobile operating system (OS) market.

The Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) investigated Google for allegedly preventing local smartphone makers from customizing its Android OS.

The fine is the latest antitrust setback for Google in South Korea. Earlier this month, parliament passed a bill to ban major app store operators such as Google from forcing software developers to use their payment systems and effectively stopping developers from charging commission on in-app purchases.

KFTC said the fine could be the ninth-biggest it has ever imposed.

It said Google has hampered market competition by requiring smartphone makers to abide by an ""anti-fragmentation agreement (AFA)"" when they sign key contracts with Google regarding app store licences.

Under the AFA, device makers were not allowed to install modified versions of Android, known as ""Android forks,"" on their devices.

This practice has helped Google cement its market dominance in the mobile OS market, the KFTC said.

Google was not immediately available for comment on Tuesday."

The funds will support industrial modernization, rural-urban coordination, ecological development and transport infrastructure improvements, the bank said.

During the 13th Five-Year Plan period (2016-2020), the bank issued 2.7 trillion yuan in loans to the central region, focusing on supporting advanced manufacturing, major infrastructure, ecological and environmental protection, poverty alleviation, and rural revitalization.

Growth momentum in central region

Cong Liang, deputy head of the National Development and Reform Commission, told a press conference that the region enjoys robust growth momentum and can achieve high-quality development.

During the last plan period, the region recorded an average annual economic growth rate of 8.6 percent, ranking first among the four regions in the country, Cong said. The area sustained its economic growth in the first half of this year, with its total gross domestic product reaching 11.8 trillion yuan。

The central region includes Shanxi, Anhui, Jiangxi, Henan, Hubei and Hunan provinces. Its permanent population is nearly 365 million, accounting for more than a quarter of China's total.

In July, the country issued a guideline on promoting the high-quality development of the region in the new era, detailing measures to promote the area's economic growth, scientific and technological innovation, urbanization, green development, opening-up and people's well-being.

Deng Xiangyang, vice governor of Anhui Province, said the provincial government would leverage its advantages in technological innovation and contribute to the development of the whole region.

Building on its current technology edges, Anhui would strive to break new ground in cutting-edge technologies such as quantum information, thermonuclear fusion, and advanced light sources while building itself into an influential technological innovation center, said Deng.

Yin Meigen, vice governor of Jiangxi, said the province would promote opening-up at a higher level. The province, neighboring the opening-up vanguards of Zhejiang and Guangdong, pledged efforts to build its open economy pilot zone with high standards and quality. It also vowed to optimize its business environment and make full use of national development strategies like the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area development.

Shanxi, a coal-rich province, puts its focus on the reform of the energy industry. It would double down on meeting carbon-emission intensity targets set by the central government, improve energy supply quality, and cut pollution and carbon emissions in key areas, said Vice Governor Wei Tao.

According to the July guideline, the region should put a modern economic system in place by 2035, basically accomplish socialist modernization, and make substantial headway in common prosperity.

Oil pumping jacks, also known as ""nodding donkeys,"" at an oilfield. /CFP

OPEC on Monday trimmed its world oil demand forecast for the last quarter of 2021 due to the Delta coronavirus variant, saying a further recovery would be delayed until next year when consumption will exceed pre-pandemic rates.

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) said in a monthly report it expects oil demand to average 99.70 million barrels per day (bpd) in the fourth quarter of 2021, down 110,000 bpd from last month's forecast.

""The increased risk of COVID-19 cases primarily fueled by the Delta variant is clouding oil demand prospects going into the final quarter of the year,"" OPEC said in the report.

""As a result, second-half 2021 oil demand has been adjusted slightly lower, partially delaying the oil demand recovery into first-half 2022.""

Governments, companies and traders are closely monitoring the speed that oil demand recovers from last year's crash. A faster return, as predicted by OPEC, could boost prices and challenge the view that the impact of the pandemic may curb consumption for longer or for good.

Oil was trading above $73 a barrel after the report was released. Prices have risen over 40 percent this year, boosted by economic recovery hopes and OPEC+ supply cuts, although concern about the Delta variant has weighed.

Despite the downward revision to the fourth-quarter, OPEC said world oil demand in the whole of 2021 would rise by 5.96 million bpd or 6.6 percent, virtually unchanged from last month.

The growth forecast for 2022 was adjusted to 4.15 million bpd, compared to 3.28 million bpd in last month's report and an estimate of 4.2 million bpd given by OPEC sources during the group's last meeting on September 1.

""The pace of recovery in oil demand is now assumed to be stronger and mostly taking place in 2022,"" OPEC said.

""As vaccination rates rise, the COVID-19 pandemic is expected to be better managed and economic activities and mobility will firmly return to pre-COVID-19 levels."""
619,China encourages consolidation in the 'overly scattered' NEV sector,"China will encourage new energy vehicle (NEV) companies to consolidate as a way to make better use of resources, an official said on Monday.

There are currently too many NEV companies in China, and the sector is in a scattered state, said Xiao Yaqing, minister of industry and information technology.

Xiao recognized that high enthusiasm for the development of new energy vehicles has fueled the growth of the sector. However, he cautioned that due to the high technical requirements involved, resources should be concentrated in a market-oriented way.

""We'll give the full play to the role of the market and encourage companies to merge or reorganize to become bigger and stronger,"" said Xiao.

The minister added that China will speed up building the charging network and continue to support NEV sales in the rural market.

Sales of NEVs in China hit a new high of 321,000 units in August, up by 180 percent year on year, industry data showed.

In the first eight months of 2021, NEV sales surged by 190 percent year on year to 1.8 million units in the country, according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers.

E-commerce giant Alibaba recently opened an experimental staffless convenience store called Tao Cafe, which was equipped with big data and facial recognition technology.

It comes following Amazon's staffless smart store, Amazon Go, which opened in Seattle last December.

And earlier this year, French supermarket operator Auchan also went autonomous with the BingoBox store in Shanghai.

In just half a year, over a dozen such stores have opened their doors, including Chinese snack maker Wahaha's TakeGo and a robot-operated shop launched by F5.

In addition to saving on staffing costs, the use of big data and mobile technology is a big attraction of these smart stores.

New technologies are providing more opportunities for the retail sector and can also better meet consumer demands.

Dong Benhong, CMO of Alibaba, said this data collection could help retailers. It can provide information such as how long consumers look at a product and what they buy, which could help retailers efficiently arrange product displays.

With AI, a so-called ""new retail"" model has emerged, with companies like Alibaba, Yonghui superstores, Walmart and JD.com all launching new concept stores that combine a brick and mortar presence with new technologies.

With the combination of online and offline tools, it's believed that the retail sector will get a growth boost.

China’s AI sector has grown into a 8-billion-yuan industry in the first half of this year.

While sectors associated with AI have ballooned to 50 billion yuan, AI is helping to reduce overcapacity and lower manufacturing costs.

But Tesla CEO Elon Musk issued a warning about artificial intelligence and said AI should be proactively regulated.

The billionaire has long been concerned about the threats he believes AI can pose, from automation to apocalypse.

Musk also stressed that AI is ""not a physical thing, it is a kind of a deep intelligence in the network"" and the potential harm that could bring to humanity is incalculable."

That particular fight put Santos on a list alongside Alexander Gustafsson and Anthony Smith for guys who appeared to beat Jones, only to lose a close decision on the scorecards – and just like those guys, the mental toll of losing to a champion when all but two judges believe otherwise was too much and he since went on to lose to Glover Teixeira and Aleksandar Rakic. Now 37 and with only one fight remaining on his contract, this is his last stand.

Walker, on the other hand, already broke his losing streak with a win over Ryan Spann at the end of last year. In a fight that was a total scramble, Walker was knocked down twice and looked terrible before swinging the momentum the other way to grab a flash TKO victory.

His first three UFC fights were won by KO/TKO in a combined two minutes 48 seconds, each getting him a Performance of the Night bonus. They earned him a reputation as a wild, unorthodox striker – perhaps the Tony Ferguson of the light heavyweight division – then his next two fights, both decisive losses of differing kinds, instead made it clear that he went all out in his matches because he had no defense. That meant his win over Spann did nothing to suggest he'd improved at all, arguably making it worse than another loss, especially as he was coming in off a bout of COVID-19 and easily had an excuse.

A year after that fight and a switch of gyms to SBG in Dublin, Ireland, Walker had to prove he was more than a whirling dervish against an opponent literally fighting to save their career. He began admirably slow; if Conor McGregor's trainer John Kavanagh had managed to teach him anything at all, it's that a fight doesn't have to be settled on the first or second punch.

Likewise, Santos began slowly too, well aware that Walker has a level of explosiveness in him that can end fights early. They spent the first round feeling each other out, testing their respective ranges and settling in for a five-round scrap – and then continued to do so for the remaining four rounds.

From one point of view, it's understandable behavior. Neither man is in any position to lose and one is known for flashy finishes and the other has a hammer tattooed on his chest which signifies his punching power.

From a fan's perspective, 25 minutes of fighters not really fighting is incredibly tedious. Only in Rounds 2, 3 and 4 did one man land at least 11 significant strikes; in the fourth that was from Walker, it came out of 41 attempts and, to make matters even worse, only one landed to the head. Instead of seeming like a man who's learned how to defend, he fought like a man afraid to pull the trigger.

After the final bell rang, Thiago Santos was awarded the win by unanimous decision (48-47, 48-47, 48-47) and the commentators were unanimous themselves in believing the only reason why is because his hammer strength put more snaps on the few punches that landed. If it wasn't for that, it should have been a draw.

Much like Walker getting a win that meant nothing, Santos' win was so slight and, frankly, so boring that it may not even get him the new contract he needs."
626,Rising Asian star Hwang makes headlines in Premier League,"Wolves striker Hwang Hee-chan runs with the ball during their Premier League clash with Newcastle United at Molineux in Wolverhampton, England, October 2, 2021. /CFP Wolves striker Hwang Hee-chan runs with the ball during their Premier League clash with Newcastle United at Molineux in Wolverhampton, England, October 2, 2021. /CFP

There could hardly be a better start for a foreign player who joined the prestigious Premier League without much fanfare.



Last month, South Korean striker Hwang Hee-chan marked his debut in the English topflight with a smart finish as he became the first Wolves player to score this season. On Saturday, the 25-year-old again made headlines after his brilliant brace propelled the Wolvers to their first home win of the season.



Despite being thrown in at the deep end after completing his move from RB Leipzig, Hwang displayed excellent technique and composure to cause defenders all sorts of problems. ""We didn't have a lot of time, but I know of Hwang since Benfica because I followed his career from the time he went to Austria and then to Germany,"" explained Wolves manager Bruno Lage, who has been made to wait patiently for his first three points at Molineux.

Wolves have had little trouble creating goal-scoring chances, but converting them has been another matter. Against beleaguered Newcastle, Hwang surely didn't disappoint. He twice latched on to a perfectly measured through balls and slotted past goalkeeper Karl Darlow with impressive adroitness and accuracy. Netting three goals in just four appearances, Hwang has shown the potential to be one of the best new signings this summer.



""It has been my dream to come here since I was little. I was very happy, and I really appreciate the people who helped me to move here, including my family,"" Hwang told Sky Sports. ""Bruno is trying to give me lots of freedom in terms of position, allowing me to go to center-forward or the wings, playing in whatever position that I need to be.""



Hwang also revealed his ambition to follow in the footsteps of his compatriot Son Heung-min, who has been one of the most successful Asian players in European's top five leagues. The 29-year-old Tottenham sensation has consistently scored when it matters, notching 73 goals and 39 assists in 202 appearances.

When Zion Williamson was drafted by the New Orleans Pelicans with the first-overall pick on June 20, 2019, many said the team had the ""next LeBron James."" Though it was a terrible comparison – because Williamson's game is nothing like that of James in any year, that's how much people expected from 19-year-old Williamson. Less than a week earlier, the Pelicans had traded their franchise player Anthony Davis to the Los Angeles Lakers to join hands with the real James. The two won the NBA Championship in the following season. Williamson and the Pelicans missed the playoffs in the same season and did it again in the past 2020-21 season. Individually, Williamson made his NBA All-Star debut in 2021. Brandon Ingram, who came to the team as part of the Lakers' package, became an All-Star one earlier and the Mos-Improved Player too.

When you have two promising All-Star talents in your roster, it's only natural to aim for at least playoff qualification, which the Pelicans failed to get. The team traded Eric Bledsoe, Steven Adams, the No. 10 and No. 40 draft picks for 2021 plus a 2022 first-rounder (from the Lakers, top-10-protected) to the Memphis Grizzlies during the offseason for Jonas Valanciunas, the No. 17 and No. 51 picks for 2021. Removing Adams and Bledsoe as well as their big contracts gave the Pelicans enough space to chase big-name free agents like Kyle Lowry. However, what the team offered to the 35-year-old veteran (and to the Toronto Raptors) obviously were not attractive enough. Soon the Pelicans had to watch Lowry ""take his talents to South Beach and join the Miami Heat,"" in the words of LeBron James. That's why the team's decision of not keeping Lonzo Ball was confusing. Ball averaged 14.6 points, 4.8 rebounds, 5.7 assists and 1.5 steals last season. He raised his 3-point rate to 37.8 percent and drained 3.1 shots per game from downtown. Moreover, Ball's ability to drive fast break is greatly helpful to Williamson.

Nonetheless, the Pelicans decided to send Ball to the Chicago Bulls via sign-and-trade in exchange for Garrett Temple, Tomas Satoransky, a 2024 second-rounder and cash. Ball's new contract is $85 million for four years and starts at only $18.6 million. By contrast, Lowry signed a three-year, $85-million deal that begins with $27 million. After that, the Pelicans landed Devonte Graham with a four-year, $47.3-million contract. He and Satoransky should receive the most minutes in the team's point guard position. 29-year-old Tomas Satoransky is a 2.01-meter-tall orchestrator who can switch to cover more positions but he averaged only 7.7 points and 0.7 triples at 35.6 percent last season. Graham could get 14.8 points per game and made 3.3 triples at 37.5 percent. However, he has been a defensive liability since he joined the league. The arrival of Valanciunas makes good enhancement to the team's interior offensively. He got 17.1 points and 12.5 rebounds (4.1 on the offensive glass, the second-most in the league) per game last season. He and Williamson could dominate most teams' paint and make them think again before sending a small-ball squad.

Nonetheless, it's hard to say how much extra help Valanciunas could offer than Adams. Betting everything on offense seems too risky since the Pelicans are too predictable in this area with their NBA bottom 3-point shooting – they averaged 10.6 triples per game, the fourth-worst in the league, at 34.8 percent, the fifth-worst. The team's defensive rating, by the way, was 113.8 last season, which ranked 22nd of all teams. It's not anything to be proud of. Simply speaking, the Pelicans improved on offense, but made no headway, at best, on defense. They won 31 of 72 games and ranked 11th in the Western Conference last season, failing to reach even the play-in tournament. The good news for them is that most of the team's roster is young enough to make progress and they have the potential to do so. Williamson (21) and Ingram (24) aside, Nickeil Alexander-Walker is 23 and a No. 17 draft selection; Jaxson Hayes is 20 and a No. 8 selection; Kira Lewis Jr. is 20 and a No. 13 selection.

""Nearly flawless. Couldn't ask for more."" That's Hu Dewen's verdict on China's performance at the just-concluded Tokyo Paralympics and the earlier Olympics. The octogenarian's view counts: he has tracked the engrossing ebb and flow of every Games since 1984, when the live broadcast of the global spectacle was beamed into homes across China for the very first time. Hale and hearty, he is also the rarest kind of sports junkie who tirelessly buries himself in full replays from the past Olympics. ""I just can't get enough of this sort of stuff,"" the soft-spoken old bloke mused before retreating to his self-proclaimed ""Game Room"". Hu will have a lot to chew on this time around. Coming close on the heels of the Olympics in which China equaled its best achievement in an overseas Games by winning 38 gold medals, just one behind the top-ranked U.S., Team Dragon again reigned supreme in the Paralympics. True to form, they displayed unmatched dominance to seal 96 golds and extended their breathtaking string of success at the showpiece event, having topped the medals table at every Paralympics since 2004. While the flame that lit up Tokyo for the best part of six eventful weeks was elaborately doused on Sunday night in a closing ceremony that echoed the unrelenting COVID-19 crisis and brought an end to Japan's Olympic summer, avid watchers like Hu won't have to wait long for the next sporting extravaganza. The 2022 Winter Olympics are less than five months away, as all eyes now turn to the host city Beijing, whose successful staging of the Games in 2008 is still fresh in the memory.

In a scheduling quirk, the 180-day gap between Tokyo 2020 and Beijing 2022 marks the shortest turnaround between editions of the Olympics since 1992 - the last time the Winter and Summer Games were held in the same year. While uncertainty remains the new normal during the coronavirus era, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) President Thomas Bach was oozing confidence that China could pull off a brilliant feast for sports fans around the world. ""All the elements are now in place for China to host the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics, which will change the landscape of winter sports forever. The whole Olympic family is looking forward to this global festival,"" declared Bach in a congratulatory letter sent to the 2021 World Winter Sports Expo (WWSE), which went live at Beijing's stylish Shougang Park on Friday. As a central platform for the international winter sports industry, this year's WWSE devotes multiple exhibition booths, professional presentations and panel discussions to detail the final preparations for the Beijing Winter Games. Key milestones were underlined by various interactive platforms. All competition venues have been completed and passed on-site pre-homologation tests, while the Olympic Village and International Broadcast Center have also been primed to welcome guests.

The WWSE, a key part of the 2021 China International Fair for Trade in Services (CIFTIS), also spotlighted China's deepening cooperative ties with winter sports powerhouses. Finland, Norway, Austria and Switzerland have all hosted and trained Chinese elite coaches and athletes in their world-class sports facilities over the past few years. Meanwhile, more than 300 campaigns to raise awareness on winter sports was held in China in recent months, engaging nearly 100 million people, according to Zhang Qian, head of the international relations department of the Beijing 2022 Olympic Games Organizing Committee (BOCOG). Over 1.1 million people have signed up as volunteers, he added. As a testament to China's pledge to stage a Green Olympics, all venues will be powered 100 percent by renewable energy with the electricity being generated by means of wind power and solar photovoltaic (PV) systems. The Beijing Games are only the second Winter Olympics to achieve ISO 20121 certification, an international standard governing sustainable event management created by the International Organization for Standardization.

And more to the point, with Tokyo 2020 now in the rear-view mirror, Beijing 2022 will ramp up for the final stretch. ""Ten international test events, two domestic test events and three international training weeks will be held in Beijing from October to December,"" said Liu Yumin, head of the planning and construction department of the BOCOG. As Beijing organizers have not revealed the full extent of the COVID-19 countermeasures yet, those test events could offer a sneak peek at the meticulous precautions they are expected to take against COVID-19. China has repeatedly asserted that its top priority in holding the Olympics is the health and safety of all those involved in the event. The country has backed up its words with the setting up of a coronavirus prevention and control task force, which is jointly headed by the BOCOG, the IOC and the World Health Organization, and dedicated to meet the exacting standards required of the Winter Games. ""We will learn from Tokyo's experience and take into account Beijing's current anti-virus policies,"" observed Liu. ""Preventive measures will be implemented specific to each venue's needs. Some temporary facilities, such as separate walkways, wall claddings, makeshift restrooms and isolation centers, are being added to all venues to minimize exposure and cross-infection.""

Zheng Tao and Lu Dong both won four swimming championships. Moreover, when Zheng won the won the men's 50m freestyle S5 final on Wednesday, he added the 500th gold medal under Team China since the team's debut at the Paralympic Games in 1984 in New York City in the U.S. and Stoke Mandeville in Britain. Chinese swimmers also won all medals four times in swimming, watching three Chinese national flags fly at the same time happen as many as four times.

Chinese athletes also dominated table tennis – in which they won 16 golds, more than the total sum of all the athletes left – and wheelchair fencing – Team China won 11 of the 16 titles of this sport. Chinese players also had five badminton golds when the sport was included in the Paralympics for the first time in Tokyo. A total of 29 world records were broken by Chinese athletes. Three of the new records went to Zheng. Ma Jia did it twice as she won the women's 50m freestyle S11 final both in the first time and in the rematch. Of course, gold medal is only one symbol for success – there were other breakthroughs achieved and just as valuable.

635,'The Olympics becomes political; there's no getting away from it',"Editor's note: CGTN's First Voice provides instant commentary on breaking stories. The daily column clarifies emerging issues and better defines the news agenda, offering a Chinese perspective on the latest global events.

The Beijing Winter Olympics 2022 is to ""ban"" international spectators.

This is the headline on a slew of Western online media outlets. Well… Apparently, the principles Beijing unveiled on Wednesday to prevent COVID-19 are, again, maliciously being interpreted by those hunting desperately for fresh ammunition to attack China as ""solid"" supportive evidence for their old claim that China is a ""monster"" on human rights issues, and now is stripping the right of spectators to attend the Games.

It's true that no tickets will be sold to spectators from outside the Chinese mainland. But does that mean discrimination against foreigners?

Spectators, no matter their nationality, will have equal access to the Beijing events as long as they reside in the mainland and meet the requirements of COVID-19 countermeasures. There is no difference between Chinese nationals and foreigners. The principle is not a matter of discriminatory treatment on certain groups of people, as some Western media hype.

The protocol is made purely to contain the spread of the virus. Since the outbreak of the pandemic, China has adopted strict lockdown and quarantine measures. As COVID-19 is sweeping across the globe with death tolls in even some developed countries still surging on a daily basis, harsh countermeasures have turned out to be a trump card in putting the virus under control.

And apparently, a nod to those from outside the mainland could mean increased risks regarding the virus and thus would be an irresponsible decision.

Beijing put its countermeasures on the official website of the games with clarity – and with an English version as well. Anyone with basic reading comprehension skills, let alone Western journalists, knows the principle is not to discriminate against anyone.

But see how the West reports the matter?

Apart from implicitly implying China's ""discrimination"" by using words like ""ban international spectators,"" some outlets turn out to be more outrageous at discrediting China at the cost of accurate and objective journalism. ""No foreign spectators at 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, but Chinese residents allowed to attend."" This is what USA Today put in its headline, deliberately drawing a comparison between ""different"" treatment toward Chinese and foreigners that it fabricated.

A piece of Western-style ""objective"" news with lines of false information."
636,Jordan Larson on USA winning women's volleyball gold in Tokyo,"The USA women's volleyball captain Jordan Larson spoke to CGTN's Wang Dong after leading her team to win gold in the 2020 Tokyo Summer Olympics. The Americans described victory in Tokyo as a dream come true.

USA had won three silver medals and two bronze medals since first getting on the medal stand in 1984. After decades-long quest for the first Olympic gold, they finally got to the top step by beating Brazil, the team that kept the USA from the throne twice in Beijing in 2008 and London in 2012.

Larson thought unity is one of the team's keys to success and she felt surprised by the straight-set win against China when they beat the defending champions 3-0 in the group stage. However, the outside hitter understood the dismay of Lang Ping's squad over the group stage exit.

The Tokyo Olympic women's volleyball MVP also announced in the interview that she will continue her club career by returning to China to play for Shanghai again this season. But the 34-year-old has not decided on her plans for the 2024 Paris Summer Olympics. However, she is confident that USA will be among contenders in Paris."
637,Diving gold medalist Xie Siyi: I have gone through too much in 9 years,"Twenty-five-year-old Xie Siyi won the gold medals of both men's 3m springboard and synchronized 3m springboard in the Tokyo Olympics.

Xie's performance was dominant in the two events, but it may surprise you that he joined the Chinese national diving team in 2012 and made his Olympic debut nine years later.

In 2014, Xie broke his leg twice and one of the doctors told him he could not dive anymore. However, Xie made it back to the springboard half a year later and won the title in men's 1m springboard event in the World Aquatics Championships in Kazan in 2015.

Nonetheless, Xie's bad luck did not stop. He had to undergo surgery again right before the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro in 2016. He could barely walk during that time, not to mention attend the Olympics.

But Xie came back in the end. When he was standing on the podium wearing the gold medal, only he knew how much he has gone through in all these years."
638,China's Chen Meng lives up to the status as world's top paddler,"Chinese table tennis star Chen Meng lived up to her status as world number one by winning the women's singles gold medal at the Tokyo Olympics, winning an all-China final over teammate Sun Yingsha 4-2 last week.

It was Chen's first Olympic gold medal, but the 27-year-old said she had already turned the page and shifted her focus from her crowning moment to women's team final between China and Japan due to happen on Thursday.

""In fact, I think the mood at this moment has actually calmed down a lot,"" said Chen in an interview with CGTN.

""Because it has been a few days since the end of the women's singles final, now we've turned our focus to the team event. I also hope that in this relatively good state, I will be able to win another gold medal, together with others of the team.""

After winning the top honor, Chen hugged her coach Ma Lin for the first time, expressing her respect and gratitude.

""Over the past two years, I've been working with my coach Ma Lin, and getting to know each other better. And our communication, coupled with victories, has taught us to trust each other more and more. So our cooperation continues to get stronger, and the progress that has been made in the last two years is there for all to see.""

The 27-year-old believes she and teammate Sun are sharing this era as top paddlers in the world.



""Actually this is our era. I think Sun Yingsha is also very good because she's much younger than I and she can sweep past opponents like Mima Ito in an event like the Olympics. Those wins give us a lot of excitement and confidence. And I really want to thank all of my opponents because it is their progress that pushes me to constantly improve and get stronger.""

Chen also said she looks forward to defending her title at Paris Olympics three years later.



""For me, I absolutely hope to participate in the Paris Olympics, and I want to have that opportunity to represent China once again. In fact, there isn't much time before the Paris Olympics, so I want to keep working hard over the next three years to maintain my best form."""
639,Now or never for karate masters as they face off for Olympic glory,"From Cobra Kai to Chuck Norris, karate is known around the world – but practitioners of the Japanese martial art are hoping the Tokyo Olympics can bring an even wider audience.

After decades of campaigning, karate finally kicks its way onto the Olympic stage in Japan as one of four sports making a Games debut.

But the International Olympic Committee's decision to drop it from the 2024 Paris Games means it only has one shot to make an impact.

In Japan – the birthplace of the high-kicking, hard-punching martial art – practitioners young and old want the sport to leave a lasting impression on global viewers.

""In reality, the Olympics is a boost on all levels,"" says French karate Olympian Steven Da Costa. ""What people are interested in is the Games. I really felt the buzz around the world [championships] when I was world champion, but the Games are still the Games.""

Karate officials have, since the 1970s, been pushing for the sport's Olympic inclusion, and the athletes taking part this summer are excited to be there finally.

""It feels significant that the first time karate is appearing at the Olympics is in Tokyo,"" said Mayumi Someya, who will represent Japan in the women's competition.

""I think it's important that we convey the appeal of karate when we appear at the Games.""

640,Chen Yufei: Win over nemesis Tai signifies recognition for my efforts,"Chen Yufei won the gold medal in women's singles badminton by edging Tai Tzu-ying of Chinese Taipei 2-1 in the final on Sunday. Chen's victory brought the title back to China after a streak of four straight Olympic golds was broken five years ago in Rio de Janeiro.

Chen and the national team are optimistic that her victory on Sunday will ring in a new era for the country in this event.



Chen needed three sets to outclass Tai at the Musashino Forest Sport Plaza and claimed just her fourth win in 19 matches against the current world number one. The 23-year-old picked up the highly sought-after gold medal for China, as the national squad have been eager to regain their dominance on the women's side of the net.



""I really felt a huge sense of relief since that was a grueling match, so I just naturally collapsed to the court immediately, and the gold medal, to me, signifies recognition for my efforts,"" Chen told CGTN Sports Scene.



After Spain's defending champion Carolina Marin withdrew from the Olympics due to injury, the women's singles bracket was thrown wide open. Tai and India's P.V. Sindhu were among the biggest favorites to claim the title. Chen did not necessarily expect to end up on top of the podium.



Chen said she didn't think much about the outcome before the Games because she just plays her own style and focuses on the process. According to her, competing at the next Olympics will be her primary goal alongside other goals, like taking part in the Uber Cup Team Event and the World Championships.

As she chases additional honors, Chen is looking forward to a fresh start after claiming her first Olympic gold, since holding one of badminton's biggest honors will leave her needing to dig deep to fend off the best shots from each and every challenger."
641,Tokyo 2020: BMX Freestyle cements extreme sports' Olympic arrival,"""BMX in the Olympics was never a goal from day one. I found out about it in 2018. So I kind of fell into doing that. It meant I could quit my job which was working full time in a kitchen,"" Worthington said.

Team Great Britain's Charlotte Worthington won gold in the women's event. Just three years ago, Worthington was working full time at a Mexican restaurant near Manchester in England. She received UK lottery funding once BMX freestyle was brought into the Olympic fold. She is now celebrating becoming the first-ever Olympic champion in BMX women's freestyle.

BMX Racing was introduced at the Beijing Olympics in 2008 and has grown in strength and popularity since then, gaining respectability along the way. BMX freestyle made its debut in Tokyo and looks set to stay.

Tokyo 2020 has welcomed a host of new events, many aimed at a younger demographic. Skateboarding and surfing both enjoyed successful debuts at the Olympic Games, capturing the imagination with some spectacular competition and incredible visuals.

The journey to the top was not straightforward for Worthington, who also has endured her fair share of injuries.

""It was actually only four weeks ago that I dislocated my shoulder. So, there were a lot of tough days. But to get here and get this was all worth it,"" she said.

Worthington's success was built on a 360-degree backflip. She fell on her first attempt, but landed on the second. It's the first time a woman has successfully completed the maneuver in a competition.

She added ""going into this, I set my sights on gold, and I knew that I had to do something special. It is very easy in BMX to back down from things. It is a very scary sport. But by the second run, I was thinking I have got to give myself a chance to do this. And as soon as I did that, and I got out of my own way, it just happened.""

Great Britain has enjoyed an immensely successful BMX campaign. A British athlete even won medals in all four BMX events. And that's likely to spur more interest in the sport both at home and globally.

""I think it will be showing extreme sports in a new light. There is definitely a stigma attached to them. And I think we are just proving that wrong. We are athletes in the same way Usain Bolt is an athlete. We work as hard. We sacrifice as hard. And then we reap the rewards,"" said Worthington.

It has been a fast turn around for Worthington, swapping a restaurant kitchen for the Olympic stage. But it's a recipe that others will be looking to emulate."
642,CGTN Sports Talk: Take it or leave it on NBA free agency market,"It did not take long for most NBA teams and players to reach agreements on contract extension, sign-and-trade, and other deals.

Ethiopian runner Sisay Lemma claimed his first world marathon major by winning the men's London Marathon in 2:04:01 in London, England, on Sunday.

It was Lemma's first win in nine attempts at a marathon major and also saw him improve on his seventh and third place finishes at this event in 2016 and 2020 respectively.

The 30-year-old finished ahead of Kenya's Vincent Kipchumba (2:04:28) and compatriot Mosinet Geremew (2:04:41).

Defending champion Shuran Kitata, who last year stunned marathon world record holder Eliud Kipchoge to win the race, finished in sixth place in 2:07:51.

Kipchoge opted to skip this year's event to recover from his participation at the Tokyo Olympics where he defended the gold medal he won in Rio in 2016 thereby becoming just the third man in history to defend a men’s marathon title.

Kitata, on the other hand, had already lowered expectations about his performance after he revealed in his pre-race press conference that he had suffered a hamstring injury two weeks before the Olympic marathon. That injury resulted in him dropping out after less than 10km.

658,"Suarez deepens Barcelona crisis, Man United stumble again","Luis Suarez piled more misery on Barcelona by scoring in a 2-0 victory for Atletico Madrid on Saturday, but Ronald Koeman insists he has the club's support to continue as coach.

Barca president Joan Laporta had said a few hours before kick-off that Koeman would continue as coach ""regardless of the result"" at the Wanda Metropolitano, but another limp display will put that commitment to the test over the two-week international break.

Koeman confirmed after the game he spoke to Laporta on Friday night and Saturday morning. He said he welcomed the clarity over his future, which he believes will benefit the team.

""Clarity is very important, for the confidence of the coach, for the players too, for them to know the coach is still here,"" said Koeman. ""He has made his decision, as he said this afternoon, so everything is perfect.""

Goal scorer Suarez put his hands together and looked up to the sky in what was initially a muted celebration, out of respect for his former club, where he spent six years and scored 198 goals.

""(It was) out of respect, love, for the journey I had at Barca and for the period they're in at the moment, for the fans as well,"" said Suarez after the game.

But the Uruguayan also made a telephone gesture and appeared to aim it at Koeman, perhaps referencing the abrupt manner Barca's coach told him he was surplus to requirements at Camp Nou, just over a year ago. ""That was for the people who think I'm still using the same number,"" said Suarez with a smile.

Thomas Lemar had already fired Atletico in front and, two down before half-time, Barcelona looked vulnerable to another hammering on the back of successive 3-0 defeats in the Champions League by Bayern Munich and Benfica."

Reigning world champions South Africa ended their Rugby Championship campaign on a high after defeating rivals New Zealand 31-29 in a closely fought encounter at the CBUS Super Stadium in Gold Coast on Saturday.

The All Blacks, who had already secured this year's title, had been aiming to make it six successive victories for a fifth time in the history of the tournament but were denied by a spirited performance by the Springboks.

Last week's game between the two sides was decided by a late penalty by All Blacks full-back Jordie Barrett. This time round, the Boks gave the All Blacks a dose of their own medicine with fly-half Elton Jantjies slotting a penalty in the 80th minute shortly after Barrett had kicked a penalty to make it 29-28.

Tries from Sevu Reece, Ardie Savea and Brad Weber plus a penalty and conversion from Barrett had given New Zealand a 20-14 lead at halftime.

South Africa had opened the scoring through a Damian de Allende try followed by a hat-trick of penalties from Handre Pollard.

Another penalty by Pollard cut the gap to three points shortly after the restart after which winger Makazole Mapimpi dotted down to put South Africa ahead 22-20.

Jantjies, who came on for wing S'bu Nkosi, slotted his first penalty to extend the Boks' lead to five points but Barrett landed two penalties to edge New Zealand 26-25 ahead with just four minutes of play left.

Jantjies then responded with his first drop goal in a Test a minute later to make it 28-26 but Barrett hit back with another penalty to put New Zealand ahead again 29-28.

However, Jantjies would have the final say as he successfully scored a penalty in injury time penalty to claim an epic win for the Springboks in what was the 101st Test between the two nations.

Despite the win, South Africa finished in third place behind New Zealand and hosts Australia, who earlier defeated Argentina 32-17 as the South Americans ended the campaign without a single victory.

Timo Werner and Ben Chilwell scored in the last six minutes of normal time to give Chelsea a 3-1 win against 10-man Southampton at Stamford Bridge on Saturday to go two points clear at the top of the English Premier League.

Trevor Chalobah broke the deadlock in the ninth minute heading in at the far post from a flick-on by Ruben Loftus-Cheek following a corner.

Romelu Lukaku had the ball in the net in the 36th minute but his effort was ruled out as the linesman had flagged him for being offside.

The home side again thought they had doubled their lead four minutes before halftime when Werner headed the ball into the net from Callum Hudson Odoi's cross but the goal was ruled out by VAR following a foul by Cesar Azpilicueta in the build-up.

That prompted a furious reaction from Chelsea coach Thomas Tuchel who was then booked by referee Martin Atkinson.

Southampton were awarded a penalty on the hour mark after a challenge from Ben Chilwell on former Chelsea player Tino Livramento. Southampton captain James Ward-Prowse converted the penalty to make it 1-1.

However, the game swung in Chelsea's favour after Ward-Prowse was sent off in the 75th minute after a VAR check for a dangerous tackle on Jorginho.

Chelsea pressed their advantage and were rewarded six minutes from the end of normal time when Werner tapped in Azpilicueta's low cross.

Chilwell then put the game out of reach with an excellent volley which crossed the line despite a valiant attempt by Saints goalkeeper Alex McCarthy after Lukaku and Azpilicueta both hit the woodwork.

Chelsea leads the standings with 16 points, two ahead of Liverpool, who have a game in hand, Manchester United and Everton, who also have 14 points.

Earlier on Saturday, Andros Townsend cancelled out Anthony Martial's strike as Everton came from a goal down to draw 1-1 with United at Old Trafford.

In other games, Norwich gained their first point of the season following a goalless draw at Burnley, a double from South Korea's Hwang Hee-Chan gave Wolves a 2-1 win against Newcastle United and Leeds edged Watford 1-0.

Liverpool, the only unbeaten team in the league, will host defending champions Manchester City at Anfield on Sunday knowing a win will take them top of the table.

""We're preparing for Saturday's game. I can't say anything. But I have eyes and ears and I know a lot of things have been leaked, which I imagine are true, but no one has said anything to me.""

Reports of Barca wanting to fire Koeman did not come out of nowhere. The Spanish heavyweights lost to Benfica 3-0 in Wednesday's UEFA Champions League game. The result was upsetting, the process of how they lost was frustrating, and the fact that Barcelona were the only team to score zero goals of all 96 squads that attended the European competitions this week, was humiliating."

Premier League players who are fully vaccinated will be allowed to travel to countries on the UK's red list during the international break and will be allowed to train or play when they quarantine on return, the government said on Friday.

Many clubs refused to release players to ""red list"" countries such as Brazil and Argentina last month and the Premier League is looking to avoid a similar situation which angered national federations.

The strict COVID-19 quarantine rules require those who return to England from a red list country to quarantine in a hotel for 10 days, but players will now be quarantined at ""bespoke facilities"" and will be allowed to train or play.

""We have worked closely with football authorities to achieve an outcome that balances the interests of both club and country while maintaining the highest levels of public health and safety,"" a government spokesperson said.

""Our best defense against the virus is vaccination and these new measures will allow fully vaccinated players to fulfill their international duties in the safest, most practical way possible, while allowing them to train and play with their clubs as early as possible upon their return.""

The international break runs from October 4 to 15, with the Premier League resuming on October 16."
665,NWSL suspends weekend matches after abuse allegations expose,"The National Women's Soccer League (NWSL) has postponed this weekend's games following the fallout from the sacking of English head coach Paul Riley by North Carolina Courage due to allegations of sexual misconduct.

A statement by NWSL Commissioner Lisa Baird on Friday said the decision had been taken to give everyone ""some space to reflect"" in light of an ""incredibly traumatic"" period for players and staff.

""Business as usual isn't our concern right now. Our entire league has a great deal of healing to do, and our players deserve so much better. We have made this decision in collaboration with our players association and this pause will be the first step as we collectively work to transform the culture of this league, something that is long overdue,"" Baird said.

According to an investigation by sports website The Athletic, a report detailed accusations by former players Riley had coached since 2010.

Riley allegedly made inappropriate comments about players' weight and sexual orientations. The accusations span several teams and leagues over a decade. Riley has denied the accusations.

Following the publication of the report, North Carolina Courage on Thursday fired Riley and threw its support behind the players who came forward.

The NWSL players' association also called for an investigation into how Riley, who has coached women's teams since 2006, was employed in the league again in 2016, just months after complaints were first levelled against him.

Riley, though, is not the first NWSL coach to be sacked for sexual misconduct or abusive behavior this season.

Richie Burke of the Washington Spirit was fired last month over allegations of verbal and emotional abuse.

Former world number ones Andy Murray and Kim Clijsters have been handed wild cards to the upcoming Indian Wells Masters, also known as the BNP Paribas Open, organizers announced on Thursday.

Murray, 34, and Clijsters, 38, have struggled with injuries in recent years.

Murray has had two hip surgeries so far, the first in 2018, then again in 2019. He missed out on most competitions in 2018, including the Australian Open, French Open and Wimbledon, and made only one appearance in 2019, ousted after the first round in the Australian Open.

Murray continued to suffer early exits in 2020, unable to make it past the second round at Roland Garros and Flushing Meadows.

The veteran made his first quarter-final at ATP level in two years at the Moselle Open last week in Metz, France, followed by a defeat to world number 10 Casper Ruud in the second round of the San Diego Open.

Clijsters, a mother of three, has told the Women's Tennis Association that Murray was an inspiration to her.

""Seeing Andy Murray and the way he speaks about his comeback and everything, it's so motivating and it gives you a lot of energy too.""

The 2011 Australian Open champion retired twice from professional tennis, and announced her latest comeback in February 2020.

U.S. Open champion Emma Raducanu, 18, has also been confirmed with a main draw wild card, along with her finals opponent, Leylah Fernandez, the other teenage sensation who rose to fame at Flushing Meadows last month.

Qatar will hold its first ever Formula One Grand Prix in November replacing the cancelled Australian GP, organizers announced on Friday.

The race will take place at the Losail International Circuit north of Doha on November 21 and will form the first part of a Middle Eastern ending to the Formula One season as it will be followed by races in Saudi Arabia and the season-ending Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.

Qatar has also signed a 10-year deal to host Formula One from 2023.

The Australian GP, traditionally a season-opener, was moved towards the end of the season in a bid to ensure it could go ahead in light of COVID-19 restrictions. In spite of that, it was cancelled for a second year running.

""We are very pleased to welcome Qatar to the Formula 1 calendar this season and for the longer term from 2023,"" said F1 President and CEO Stefano Domenicali. ""We have shown that we can continue to adapt and there is huge interest in our sport and the hope from many locations to have a Grand Prix.""

""The huge effort from all the teams, F1 and the FIA has made it possible to deliver a 22-race calendar, something that is very impressive during a challenging year and something we can all be proud of,"" he added.

The Losail Circuit opened in 2004 and has hosted Moto GP since then, under floodlights which will also be used for the Grand Prix.

In its statement, F1 said it would confirm the venue for the race in Qatar from 2023 onward at a later date, suggesting a possible change from Losail."

Barely two months after the French Ligue 1 tie between Nice and Marseille was infamously and unceremoniously abandoned due to a pitch invasion and despicable behavior, European football on Thursday night was again disrupted by fan violence. A hot-tempered Europa League encounter between Marseille and Galatasary in the southern French city was interrupted for about 10 minutes after rival fans at the Stade Velodrome threw firecrackers and smoke-bombs at each other. As the situation escalated, the referee had no choice but to halt the match before police intervened to restore order. The game then resumed, ending in a goalless draw. But the trouble on and off the pitch was far from over.

Spanish national team center and two-time NBA champion Pau Gasol is expected to announce his retirement from professional basketball at a press conference on October 5, according to Lucas Saez-Bravo of El Mundo. Gasol has been considering the next step in his career since playing for Spain at the Tokyo Olympics in August. He joined Barcelona in February, helping the team finish second in the EuroLeague Final Four and win the ACB championship.

The last NBA team Gasol played for was the Milwaukee Bucks (in 2019), which marked his fifth stop in the North American league. Drafted by the Atlanta Hawks with the third overall pick in 2001 and immediately traded to the Memphis Grizzlies, Gasol averaged 17 points, 9.2 rebounds, 3.2 assists and 1.6 blocks in 1,226 regular season games over 18 seasons. Gasol's lengthy NBA career could be divided into several stages. He was one of the league's most skillful big men in his six-and-a-half seasons with the Grizzlies. As a true seven-footer, Gasol was strong enough to cover most centers in isolation and possessed the agility and wingspan to be a great rim protector. Offensively, the Spanish giant had an arsenal of post moves and could fire from mid-range. Moreover, he was a much better passer than most big men in the league at that time. However, Gasol never led the Grizzlies past the first round in the Western Conference playoffs, partly because the team was not strong enough to do so. But many ignored that and began to call him a ""soft"" big man.

The turning point of Gasol's career happened in 2008 when he was traded to the Los Angeles Lakers. He and Kobe Bryant comprised the top screen-play pair in the NBA. Bryant was named the MVP. Gasol reached the NBA Finals with the Lakers. Everything seemed so perfect until the purple and gold lost 4-2 to the Boston Celtics in the Finals. Gasol was humiliated by Kevin Garnett in the series and was again described as a ""soft"" big man. But Gasol was a much tougher guy than he, or his game, appeared. Not only did he help the Lakers win the following two NBA Championships, he was also named a two-time All-Star and to the All-NBA Second Team after joining the Chicago Bulls.

""I just heard the final bell. Boxing is over,"" said the 42-year-old Pacquiao, now a Philippine senator, drawing a flood of reactions from fans ranging from disbelief to gratitude. Pacquiao, whose fast footwork and the blistering speed of punches made him one of the top offensive fighters in the sport's history, said he was at peace with his decision, adding it was the turn of other Filipino boxers to shine. ""As I hang up my boxing gloves, I would like to thank the whole world, especially the Filipino people, for supporting Manny Pacquiao,"" he said, fighting back tears. Pacquiao came from impoverished beginnings as a ship stowaway who started fighting on the streets as a boy, with prizes of $2 a fight. His net worth was $63 million last year, according to his Philippines statement of assets. He is widely rated as among the best pound-for-pound fighters in history, better than Muhammad Ali, veteran promoter Bob Arum said in 2010.

However, for most of the 95 minutes, Villarreal were the better side and were left to rue not taking their chances, as they sit at the bottom of the group on one point from two games. ""We're annoyed. The game was basically over, we just needed to see it out and we didn't,"" said Villarreal defender Pau Torres. ""We were impeccable before that.

Lionel Messi gave Paris Saint-Germain fans what they came for as he helped them beat visitors Manchester City 2-0 in their Champions League clash with his first goal for his new club on Tuesday.

The Argentine forward, who joined PSG on a two-year contract after leaving Barcelona, found the top corner superbly in the second half to add to Idrissa Gueye's early first-half opener and put the capital club top of Group A on four points.

The 34-year-old Messi had been quiet on his fourth appearance for PSG until he netted on the counter as his link-up play with their French striker Kylian Mbappe bore fruit.

After two games, City are third on three points after their first defeat in a group stage game since 2018 ended an 18-match unbeaten run, one point behind PSG and Club Brugge, who won 2-1 at RB Leipzig."

N'Golo Kante is set to miss Chelsea's UEFA Champions league clash with Juventus on Wednesday after testing positive for COVID-19.

The London club announced the development on Tuesday, noting that the 30-year-old has gone into self-isolation as dictated by health protocols.

Kante will also miss Chelsea's Premier League clash with Southampton on Saturday, and may also miss out on France's Nations League clash with Belgium on October 7.

Other than Kante, Chelsea will also be without Christian Pulisic, Mason Mount and Reece James for the game against Juventus. All three have injuries.

The Blues will be hoping to return to winning ways after losing 1-0 to Manchester City last weekend.

Juventus currently top Group H on goal difference, having beaten Malmo 3-0 in the opening fixture while Chelsea managed a 1-0 victory over Zenit Saint Petersburg."

Shui Qingxia, manager of the United Team at the women's football event at the Chinese National Games in Xi'an, northwest China's Shaanxi Province, shared the story of how she led her squad to win the gold medal in an interview with Guangzhou-based sports newspaper Soccer News. Back in August, Shui took over a team that finished the Tokyo Olympics winless and allowing 17 goals. ""I was told at the last moment to coach the United Team. The coaching staff came from the top three teams at the last National Games,"" said Shui. ""I'm the manager. The goalkeeper coach and assistant manager are from Jiangsu. The team leader is from Hebei."" Shui revealed that they only had three weeks for training and practice and all sessions were intense. ""We had no idea how they looked like after 21 days of quarantine,"" said Shui, who wanted to help the players shake off the dust in Tokyo as soon as possible. She believes it's unfair to blame the national team for the disappointing result at the Olympics.

Shui told her players at their first meeting she wanted them to show more positive spirits. ""We are the national team. Everybody is looking at us,"" said Shui. Shui was glad to see that her players all worked hard in training. Of course, she did more than give them mental massages. ""I asked them to raise their heads before passing. We also made special arrangements for free kicks and corner kicks."" The United Team defeated Shanghai in the final. Shui was Shanghai's manager before taking over the United Team. ""There's nothing wrong with leading a new team to play against an old team I had coached for so long. But since I was the United Team's manager, I surely wanted them to make the best performance on the field. I'm fully invested in coaching the United Team,"" said Shui.

Paris Saint-Germain are hosting Manchester City at Parc des Prince in the UEFA Champions League game Tuesday night. The French giants' newly-landed superstar Lionel Messi is meeting Pep Guardiola, the manager who led Messi and Barcelona to the peak in 2009 and 2011. City are a formidable rival, but PSG have other things to worry about. One of them is the lack of chemistry between Messi and the rest of the team. So far, he has played three games for PSG but scored no goal or assist at all. That's unacceptable because it's Messi pairing with Neymar and Kylian Mbappe. Former French national team striker Nicolas Anelka said Messi should be the one assisting Mbappe, not the other way around.

""Mbappe has to lead the attack because he's No. 1. Messi was at Barcelona, but now he has to serve Mbappe. He's been at the club for five years, and Messi has to respect him,"" Anelka told Le Parisien. ""He's a phenomenal player in terms of his speed; there's no one better on the planet. If Paris want to have the best team, they have to do everything they can to keep him."" The irony is, Mbappe has repeatedly rejected contract extension offers from PSG, including the latest offer in September. ""But I think it's very clear in Kylian's head. He wants to see something else, and that makes sense. He's dreaming of the Ballon d'Or, and how can he win it if he's playing in the sixth-best league by UEFA coefficient? If Kylian had been in England or Spain for the last three years, he would have already won the Ballon d'Or,"" said Anelka.

Messi was taken off the field in the Ligue 1 game against Olympique Lyonnais on September 19. Though it was later revealed that he was injured, the rumor of the Argentine superstar falling out with manager Mauricio Pochettino spread quickly like wildfire. Anelka said he understands Messi's frustration: ""You don't take off a six-time Ballon d'Or winner in the 65th minute when he hasn't scored for his team. That plays with his head a lot. A forward needs his coach to show him confidence, and that right there won't do it. I'm getting ahead of myself but Messi will not forget what Pochettino has done. It will stay with him. He's the star of the team and it was his first game at the Parc des Princes. It's going to be very difficult to recover from that as a situation."" ""Messi didn't play against Metz, and for me that's already a response. You can't manage Messi like that. The coach wanted to send out a strong message, which is good, but this is Messi,"" added Anelka.

The Denver Nuggets reached a five-year, $207-million contract extension with their forward Michael Porter Jr., ESPN reported, citing Porter Jr.'s agent Mark Bartelstein of Priority Sports. The 23-year-old must make one of the three All-NBA Teams in the 2021-22 season to make the full amount of the salary or the deal will become $172 million for five years. As a 2.08-meter-tall forward averaged 19 points, 7.3 rebounds and 2.8 triples at 44.5 percent last season. The combination of his shooting and size reminds one of Kevin Durant. However, keeping him with a maximum deal is still a controversial decision for the following reasons:

Michael Porter Jr. (#1) of the Denver Nuggets shoots in Game 6 of the NBA Western Conference first-round playoffs against the Portland Trail Blazers at Moda Center, Portland, Oregon, U.S., June 3, 2021. /CFP Michael Porter Jr. (#1) of the Denver Nuggets shoots in Game 6 of the NBA Western Conference first-round playoffs against the Portland Trail Blazers at Moda Center, Portland, Oregon, U.S., June 3, 2021. /CFP

First, Porter Jr. has been no more than a pure finisher in the past two years. His dribble is not even good enough to protect the ball, let alone launch offense off the dribble from outside the 3-point line. As a result, the Nuggets cannot rely on him to lead a squad by himself on the court. Second, Porter Jr.'s history of back injuries will be a true concern over his consistency. That problem cost him the whole rookie season. It's also why the Nuggets could draft him with the 14th pick. He was a top selection candidate when he was healthy. Third, Porter Jr. is still not a trustworthy defender. So far, he has been an okay one-on-one defender against most big men in the league thanks to his size and power. But other than that, he is below average. He does not have good enough reading of the opponents' offense, especially for screen play. As a result, he would easily make poor decisions in switch. Moreover, he has not learnt how to take advantage of his height and athleticism. He averaged only 0.9 blocks last season.

685,UEFA ends Super League legal fight against European rebels,"UEFA has dropped its legal case against Barcelona, Juventus and Real Madrid over their roles in initiating the controversial European Super League (ESL) project , which has threatened to dramatically upend the football landscape . European football's governing body announced on Monday night that ""in the matter related to a potential violation of UEFA's legal framework in connection with the so called 'Super League,' the UEFA Appeals Body has declared today the proceedings null and void, as if the proceedings had never been opened."" The moves comes after a Spanish court ruled that UEFA should not punish the three clubs that remain committed to the doomed project. UEFA added that the other nine clubs involved in the attempted breakaway – Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United, Tottenham Hotspur, Atletico Madrid, AC Milan and Inter Milan – will not need to pay the fines imposed on them for trying to set up the Super League.

Earlier in the day, Liverpool denied any suggestion that their U.S. owners were privately sympathetic to the breakaway league.



""Our involvement in the proposed ESL plans has been discontinued. We are absolutely committed to following that through and there should be no ambiguity to suggest otherwise. We are acting on the best legal advice and approach to appropriately end our involvement,"" read a statement.



The stance was echoed by Liverpool's arch-rivals Manchester United, who said: ""Our position as announced previously has not changed – we shall not be participating in the European Super League. The process for dissolving the European Super League entity is impacted by ongoing litigation in Spain. We are not involved in that litigation and therefore it would be inappropriate to comment."""

Even Mikel Arteta's fiercest critics had to admit that Arsenal have lift-off. The rejuvenated Gunners humbled Spurs with three goals within 23 minutes in a remarkable one-sided north London derby at the Emirates. More than that, the slick superiority of their performance against a nervous, shambolic city rival made everyone connected with the prestigious club think something implausible was happening.



Just a couple of weeks ago, Arteta's team had made their worst start to a season for 67 years and remained rooted to the bottom of the Premier League table, while Spurs were flying high at the top with a perfect record. In a sensational turnaround, however, Arsenal have now won their last three games and sneaked into the top half, while Spurs have the same record in reverse and slumped to the bottom half.



Spurs have not won at the Emirates in the league since 2010, and the hosts overran their sorry visitors in scintillating fashion, with goals from Emile Smith Rowe, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Bukayo Saka making the difference. Though Spurs improved after the interval, Son Heung-min's late effort proved nothing more than a consolation.

""It's a special day. It is one example of what we want to do, but we have to be consistent. This win is for the fans. They were there when we needed their support,"" beamed an emotional Arteta. ""It was one of the nicest feelings that I have had in this stadium. The way we won and to feel the connection with the crowd made it really special.""



The sentiment was echoed by Smith Rowe, who stole the show with an early goal and then assisted Aubameyang for the second. ""It's probably the best day of my life,"" said the 21-year-old academy graduate. ""I've always wanted to score against Tottenham in a derby. It's just the best feeling ever.""



With another goal to his name, Aubameyang has netted eight times in 12 career appearances against Tottenham, but the veteran striker showed humility and highlighted Smith Rowe's flawless display after the game. ""It's quite easy when you have boys like him,"" he observed. ""They always listen, always ready to learn. They feel free when they play. That's why they're doing amazing.""

In sharp contrast, Spurs talisman Harry Kane struggled throughout and is still without a Premier League goal this season. But Spurs manager Nuno Espirito Santo has shouldered the blame for his team's weak loss, admitting he got his tactics wrong.



""The performance was not good,"" Nuno told a press briefing. ""The game-plan was not good. The decisions were not good. So it was not a good day for us. Definitely not a good day.""



""I'm going to be honest. When you have a game-plan you have to make the right decisions in terms of who you want to put on the pitch to develop that game-plan. I take responsibility because the decisions were not right according to the game-plan. I won't name individuals but the game-plan was not right according to the players who were on the pitch.



""We were not aggressive enough to control the dynamic of Arsenal in midfield. We suffered when we wanted to go in front and we allowed Arsenal to always come to us. Why did it go wrong? Because I decided bad. I refuse to go further than that. All that I have to say, I will say directly to the players,"" he concluded.

The U.S. crushed Europe 19-9 to recapture the Ryder Cup on Sunday in a performance captain Steve Stricker called the ""greatest of all time."" Collin Morikawa, the 24-year-old world number three, delivered the winning half point when he tied his match with Viktor Hovland at Whistling Straits. He was one of eight 20-somethings on a U.S. team that featured nine players in the world's top 11, all gunning to regain the coveted trophy won by Europe in France three years ago. ""Speechless,"" U.S. captain Steve Stricker said, tearing up as he talked of the commitment that resulted in dominant victory. The Americans became the first team to notch 19 points, beating the previous record of 18.5 achieved twice by each team before. ""This is the greatest team of all time,"" Stricker said, adding that his youthful lineup represented ""a new era for USA golf."" World number two Dustin Johnson, at 37 the oldest member of the team, provided a template for his younger colleagues, his 1-up singles victory over Paul Casey giving him a perfect 5-0 record in a maximum five matches. He became the first American since Larry Nelson in 1979 to go five-from-five, prevailing in a tightly contested battle with Casey that saw them tie the first five holes.

Johnson took the lead for good at the eighth, but he never led by more than two and couldn't put Casey away until the bitter end. Johnson said there was a key trait he shared with his younger teammates that fueled their bid to stop Europe winning a fifth Ryder Cup in six editions. ""We do not like to lose,"" Johnson said. They made that clear from the start and took an 11-5 lead into Sunday's 12 singles matches, the six-point gap more than either team has ever overcome on the final day to lift the trophy. It meant the Americans needed just 3.5 points to win the Cup. Padraig Harrington's Europe needed nine to retain it, and it was clear when the U.S. powered to the lead in most of the early matches that they wouldn't do it. Morikawa, who won his second major title at the British Open this year, had assured the U.S. of victory with a brilliant birdie at the par-three 17th, where he blasted his tee shot to three feet, going 1-up with one to play. He missed a six-footer at 18 to win the match outright, but thanks to his half-point the American celebrations were already underway. Scottie Scheffler, a Ryder Cup rookie with the lowest world ranking in the U.S. team at 21, had opened the floodgates when he took out world number one Jon Rahm 4&3. Rahm, who had excelled all week amid Europe's overall struggles, became just the third world number one to lose a Ryder Cup singles match. ""I just kept the pressure on,"" said Scheffler, who won the first four holes with birdies and was never less than 3-up after that.

Rory McIlroy gained the first point of the day with a 3&2 victory over Olympic champion Xander Schauffele, but his first win of the week was no cause for celebration as he contemplated the flood of red on the scoreboard. ""(I'm) incredibly proud to be a part of this team,"" McIlroy said, his voice cracking. ""I've been extremely disappointed that I haven't contributed more for the team."" Patrick Cantlay, the U.S. PGA Tour's player of the year and FedEx Cup playoff champion, polished off European rookie Shane Lowry 4&2. Bryson DeChambeau followed with a 3&2 victory over Sergio Garcia, the Spanish Ryder Cup great who this week took his tally of match wins to a record 25. DeChambeau's power proved too much for Garcia. The American set the tone at the first hole, driving the green at the par-four and striding off the tee to wild cheers with his driver held aloft. He won the hole with a 41-foot eagle putt and led the rest of the way. Lowry, the 2019 British Open champion, had taken a 1-up lead over Cantlay with a birdie at the par-5 second, but Cantlay roared away from there. The American won four straight holes for a 3-up lead, and didn't trail again, winning the last three holes for the convincing score. Four-time major champion Brooks Koepka rallied for a 2&1 victory over Bernd Wiesberger and Justin Thomas led all the way in a 4&3 victory over Tyrrell Hatton. Veterans Ian Poulter and Lee Westwood – whose veteran savvy was supposed to help Europe hold off the mighty Americans – delivered singles victories, Poulter beating Tony Finau 3&2 and Westwood edging Harris English 1-up.

Lewis Hamilton became the first Formula One driver to win 100 grand prix races with a dramatic rain-assisted victory in Russia that sent the Mercedes driver two points clear in the championship on Sunday. Red Bull's Max Verstappen finished an impressive second at Sochi's Olympic Park, after starting 20th and last due to engine penalties, thereby limiting the damage from his rival's fifth win of the season and first since July.

Spain's Carlos Sainz was third for Ferrari on a day of hope and ultimate heartbreak for McLaren's Lando Norris as a late downpour dashed his hopes of a first win. The 21-year-old Briton started on pole for the first time in his career, lost out to Sainz at the start but then passed the Spaniard 13 laps later and was still leading when the clouds burst. Norris decided to stay out on slicks after Hamilton had stopped for intermediates on team advice, with the top two comfortably clear of the rest. He then plunged from first to seventh in the last three laps after slipping, sliding off and eventually having to pit.

""What a race the weather provided. It's taken a long time to get to 100 and I wasn't sure it would come,"" said Hamilton, who last season passed Ferrari great Michael Schumacher's previous record of 91 wins. ""Max must've done a really great job to come up to second from last. We've got our work cut out,"" added the Briton, who started the day five points behind Verstappen with seven races remaining after Sochi. While Hamilton celebrated a personal century, his Mercedes team maintained their own 100 percent record in Sochi. The champions have won every Russian grand prix since the first in 2014 with Hamilton triumphant in five of them.

Xie Wenjun, 31, won his third straight men's 110-meter hurdles gold medal by finishing the race at 13.37 seconds at the Chinese National Games in Xi'an, northwest China's Shaanxi Province on Tuesday. When Xie received his medal, he was standing next to his coach, 66-year-old Sun Haiping. Most people began to hear Sun's name when Liu Xiang set a new world record of 12.88 seconds to win the men's 110m hurdles gold at the Summer Olympics in Athens in 2004. Sun was Liu's coach back then. Xie expressed his gratitude to Sun right after the victory in Xi'an. ""Having retained the title at the National Games, I want to first thank Sun Haiping for his help in all these years,"" Xie posted on Sina Weibo. ""Xie had his best performance of this year and he did it off an unfavorable start. He was trailing at the beginning but he didn't give up. He was catching up hurdle by hurdle and reached the leading position after the eighth hurdle. Old hands are better than green horns,"" said Sun after the race.

It has been 37 years since Sun joined the Shanghai athletics team and became the hurdles coach in 1984. From Chen Yanhao in 1993 to Xie in 2021, the athletes coached by Sun dominated all of the eight men's 110m hurdles gold medals. In fact, Sun could have retired in 2016 if he wanted to, but he did not want to leave the athletes he trained. Neither did the Shanghai athletics team want him to go. That's why the two sides agreed that Sun would continue to coach the team. ""I have reached the retirement age, but I kept thinking. Can I cultivate more competitive athletes for the team when I'm still capable?"" Sun told The Paper, a Shanghai-based Chinese digital newspaper. The 66-year-old believes the Asian Games in Hangzhou in 2022 is the bigger test for Xie. ""Competition in next year's Asian Games will be tough. There are multiple foreign athletes whose best records are 13.17 or 13.20 seconds. We will work together and try to do better,"" said Sun.

Riot Games, the company that presents the video game League of Legends (LOL) and operates LOL eSports events, announced on Friday the matchups of the coming 2021 League of Legends World Championship (Worlds 2021) in Reykjavik, Iceland. The Chinese mainland's LOL league, the League of Legends Pro League (LPL), will have four teams attend Worlds 2021 – FunPlus Phoenix (FPX), Royal Never Give Up (RNG), Edward Gaming (EDG) and LNG Esports (LNG). LNG will start from the play-in tournament and meet Hanwha Life Esports (HLE) from League of Legends Champions Korea (LCK) in their first match on October 5. Four of the 10 teams, which are divided into two pools, will be able to make the group stage of Worlds 2021. LNG and HLE (plus Cloud9, C9, from North America's League of Legends Championship Series, LCS) are considered as the three biggest hopefuls for the group stage.

LNG will meet HLE in their opening match in the first round of the play-in competitions. In the first stage, each team will play the other four teams twice in best-of-one (BO1) matches. The top-ranked team in each of the two pools will advance to the group stage directly. The remaining teams will have to compete for the final two spots (one for each pool) in best-of-five (BO5) matches. LNG's jungler Lee Seung-yong (Game ID: Tarzan) used to form a well-performing pair with HLE's mid laner Jeong Ji-hoon (Game ID: Chovy) in LCK's Griffin. Now they two will become rivals in the match.

The group stage of Worlds 2021 will begin on October 11 and the first match will take place between Worlds 9 champion FPX and Worlds 10 title winner Damwon KIA (DK) in Group A. Worlds 9 FMVP Kim Tae-sang (Game ID: Doinb) and Worlds 10 FMVP Heo Su (Game ID: ShowMaker) are considered the top 2 mid laners for this year's event. Despite their different play styles, Doinb and Showmaker are expected to bring one of the most eye-catching contests in Reykjavík. One more interesting part of the FPX-DK match is that DK's top laner Kim Dong-ha (Game ID: Khan) has been teammates with all of the members of both teams with the exception of FPX's top laner Jang Ha-gwon (Game ID: Nuguri). That's why every time the two teams were mentioned, many would call them ""Khan and his eight world champion teammates."" Can Khan make himself a world champion this time?

RNG and EDG will also appear in Day 1's matches. RNG is scheduled to play Paris Saint-Germain Talon (PSG) from the Pacific Championship Series (PCS). The two teams met in the semifinal of the Mid-Season Invitational (MSI) in May. RNG beat PSG 3-1 back then. That gave PSG every reason to put on their best form and get vengeance from RNG. Of course, RNG has their own score to settle as well, with Fnatic (FNC) of LCS. Back in 2019, RNG lost to FNC in the group stage and failed to advance. RNG's bot laner Jian Zihao (Game ID: Uzi), who was seen by many as the greatest attack damage player in LOL history, had finish his last Worlds in this way. Though Uzi already retired, RNG will still be driven to get payback.

Barcelona coach Ronald Koeman on Friday was handed the minimum two-match ban as punishment for his red card the previous evening when Barcelona drew 0-0 at Cadiz.

The Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) disciplinary committee opted to hand the Dutchman the shortest permitted suspension after his sending off in the final minute for arguing with officials as 10-man Barcelona limped to a goalless draw.

He will be forced to watch from the stands when Barca play Levante on Sunday, and again when they face Atletico Madrid.

Referee Carlos del Cerro Grande wrote in his report that Koeman was sent off for ""protesting to the fourth official in an ostentatious manner, with his arms raised, shouting and leaving the technical area, complaining: 'hey, the referee has to whistle, the referee has to whistle, dammit, he has to whistle' even though he had already been warned by the fourth official to stop protesting at the referee's decisions.""

Koeman wanted play to stop because there were two balls on the pitch.

""In this country, you get sent off for nothing,"" Koeman told the press conference after the match, explaining that ""it was for telling the fourth official that there was a second ball on the pitch, that he had to stop the game.""

Koeman is under pressure because Barcelona are already seven points behind Liga leaders Real Madrid, although they have a game in hand, and have scored five goals in five league matches."

At this year's Tokyo Olympic Games, Su became the first Chinese to qualify for the Olympic men's 100m final, setting an Asian record time of 9.83 seconds in the process.

After quarantining back in China, Su still maintained his good form at the national games, dipping under the 10-second barrier once again to win his first 100 meters title in the games, but missed out on the men's 4x200 meters relay gold with the Guangdong team.

""My national games debut was in 2009, and this is the fourth time I am here. From today's event, I can see a bright future for Chinese sprinting,"" he said.

The Midlands club, who last played in the Premier League in 2008, have won two of their eight league games this season after being subject to a transfer embargo.



The points deduction means Derby have dropped to the bottom of the Championship on minus two points. They could be docked further points for breaching the English Football League's financial regulations.



Derby, twice English champions, announced on Wednesday they had appointed three managing directors of business advisory firm Quantuma as joint administrators.

Whether Koeman is still in the post for Barca's game at home to Levante on Sunday remains to be seen but it appears now to be more a matter of when the club can find a replacement than if he will continue in charge.

""You have to always try to win each game, but you have to be realistic, you have to see the squad we have, the people we're missing,"" said Koeman.

Tucker (two-year, $15 million). The Heat's front office has been taking a cautious approach for the past two years. Reaching the NBA Finals in 2020 did not turn their heads. Pat Riley continued to manage the Heat's payroll with overpriced but short contracts, trying to collect salary space for the free agency market in 2021 while getting ready to acquire possible big fish. However, the team apparently underestimated the value of Jae Crowder and overrated the growth of their young men Tyler Herro and Robinson. They were swept by the Milwaukee Bucks, the opponents they beat 4-1 one season earlier, in the first round of the playoffs. Moreover, despite Miami's beach and nightlife, no superstar seemed willing to even take an extra look at South Beach. So, Riley decided to take a huge bet with the moves mentioned at the beginning of this article.

The Heat apparently grew stronger introducing Lowry and Tucker. Lowry averaged 17.2 points, 5.4 rebounds, 7.2 assists, 1.0 steal and 2.8 triples at 39.6 percent last season. He is a sharper slasher than Goran Dragic, a much better fast break driver and a way more reliable defender. Tucker has been one of the best postseason defenders for the past four years. He has strong lower body and enough strength to play center in a small-ball squad while being agile enough to cover perimeter players in switch defense.

However, an improved lineup does not make the Heat good enough to match the top 3 teams in the Eastern Conference. Giannis Antetokounmpo took an upgrade in the Finals in 2021. He became a better free throw shooter and learnt to find easier scores instead of throwing himself into the defensive trap. Meanwhile, he has Jrue Holiday, a younger version of Lowry, standing next to him. Now, if you recall how close the series between the Bucks and the Brooklyn Nets, which had only half of their squad left after two games, were in the Eastern semifinals, you will have a better understanding of how dominant the Nets can be with a complete and healthy lineup. The Philadelphia 76ers may be the most matchable opponents for the Heat of the three, especially with the Ben Simmons drama unsolved. Nonetheless, they may be able to steal one or two wins against the 76ers in the regular season by trapping Joel Embiid. The Heat are unlikely to keep it happening in a seven-game series. Bam Adebayo is not Marc Gasol from two years ago. Butler is no Kawhi Leonard either.

P.J. Tucker joins the Miami Heat on a two-year, $15-million contract. /CFP P.J. Tucker joins the Miami Heat on a two-year, $15-million contract. /CFP

Furthermore, the Heat have their own problems as well. Tucker could replace Crowder's defensive role but his existence will hurt the team's offense too. This side effect will be more painful in playoffs because they may need to keep Tucker longer on the court for the sake of defense. Butler is hardly helpful in this area either. He only took an average of two attempts from downtown per game in the past two seasons and his triples rate was less than 25 percent. Adebayo can make some shots in the middle range, but he is not an off-the-dribble shooter. Neither can he stretch the spacing at the 3-point line. Lowry can be trusted with his shooting, but he has never been a productive scorer. What he does the best is to offer basic offensive contributions at decent efficiency, not carry the whole team on his shoulders. It should not be forgotten either that Lowry is already 35 years old and might lose his energy at any time.

In fact, the key to the Heat's success does not lie in Butler or their new members. Victor Oladipo, Herro and Adebayo will be the deciding factors for the team to make a difference. Oladipo was only able to sign a minimum veteran deal partly because he suffered too many injuries in the past three years. He missed 46, 54 and 39 games respectively in the last three seasons. However, that also gives him the chance to make the biggest surprise. A healthy Oladipo is an All-Star guard and an All-Defensive member who could average 20 points. He could be great help to the Heat even if he only finds part of the best himself back. Herro failed to meet the team's expectations of him last season, but he's still the Heat's best hope for the future. He has the fundamentals of a sharp shooter and showed the sign of developing reliable off-the-dribble shooting. That what Robinson does not have and what the Heat needs the most from Herro.

The crisis that unfolded and escalated following FIFA's unveiling of its radical plans for a biennial World Cup reached new heights on Wednesday.



UEFA, one of the most vociferous opponents of the idea of staging the showpiece event every two years, intensified its efforts to maintain the status quo, slamming those proposing the reform plan have excluded stakeholders from discussions over the proposed schedule.



The European governing body have pointed to the huge impact such changes could have on club football, players and other international competitions like the Euros, Olympics and Women's World Cup, highlighting what they see as ""real dangers"" that would arise from the drastic changes.



UEFA said it had been ""disappointed"" with FIFA approach to the controversial plans, which ""has so far led to radical reform projects being communicated and openly promoted before having been given the chance to participate in any consultation meeting.""

""The erosion of sporting opportunities for the weaker national teams by replacing regular matches with final tournaments; the risk to sustainability for players, forced to engage in summer high intensity competitions every year instead of longer recuperation breaks in alternate years,"" read a statement.



""These are just some of the serious concerns that the FIFA proposal provokes at first glance and they cannot be dispelled simply with unsubstantiated promotional slogans on the supposed benefits of a thicker calendar for final tournaments.""



""UEFA is of the opinion that the future of the international calendar should be the subject of genuine consultation and exchange between FIFA, the confederations and key stakeholders of competitions.""



""Kicking off with an open discussion on perceived problems and considering a range of solutions that will be identified in the course of the debate, taking into account the interest of the game and the legitimate point of view of the different parties,"" it added.

UEFA also revealed that FIFA had snubbed its request for talks to discuss the concerns of European nations.



""On September 14, UEFA and its 55 member associations asked FIFA to organize a special meeting with them to be able to voice their concerns on the impact of such plans,"" the governing body said, before adding they ""have to date not yet received a reply from FIFA on this request.""



UEFA President Aleksander Ceferin has already warned that Europe could boycott the World Cup if FIFA's plans went ahead. ""We can decide not to play in it,"" Ceferin told The Times earlier this month. ""As far as I know, the South Americans are on the same page. So good luck with a World Cup like that. I think it will never happen as it is so much against the basic principles of football.""



In an attempt to validate the feasibility of a biennial World Cup, FIFA last week published a survey that claimed that the majority of respondents are in favor of increasing the frequency of World Cups.



The survey involved 23,000 people in 23 countries, across the organisation's six confederations. Of those, 15,000 respondents ""were identified as expressing an interest in football and the World Cup,"" with 55 percent in favor of a World Cup every one, two or three years, according to FIFA.

Manchester United crashed out of the English League Cup as West Ham avenged their painful loss to Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side with a 1-0 win at Old Trafford, while Chelsea and Tottenham survived penalty shoot-outs to reach the fourth round on Wednesday.

The Hammers suffered a gut-wrenching 2-1 defeat against United in the Premier League on Sunday when David De Gea saved Mark Noble's stoppage-time penalty after Jesse Lingard's late winner.

But David Moyes' men got a measure of revenge three days later as Manuel Lanzini's first half goal dumped United out in the third round.

Solskjaer made 11 changes and Moyes opted for 10 alterations, with West Ham's understudies making the most of their moment in the spotlight. Ryan Fredericks ghosted past Alex Telles and cut back for Lanzini to sweep past United goalkeeper Dean Henderson in the ninth minute.

That was enough for Moyes to secure a first win over United since they sacked the Scot after less than a season in charge in 2014. It was also West Ham's first victory at Old Trafford since 2007, earning them a home tie against holders Manchester City in the last 16.

At Stamford Bridge, Chelsea won 4-3 on penalties after a 1-1 draw against Aston Villa. Harry Kane ended his goal drought as Tottenham boss Nuno Espirito Santo knocked out his former club Wolves 3-2 on penalties after a 2-2 draw at Molineux. Arsenal eased to a 3-0 win against third tier AFC Wimbledon at the Emirates Stadium, setting up a last 16 clash with Leeds."

Bayern Munich's Robert Lewandowski received the 2021 European Golden Shoe on Tuesday, with a record-breaking 41 goals from 29 matches in the 2020/21 Bundesliga season.

The 33-year-old Polish striker outscored Lionel Messi (30) and Cristiano Ronaldo (29) as the top scorer across the continent, missing the back of the net in just four games out of the total 29, averaging 1.5 goals per game.

His record of 41 goals surpassed the previous record held by the legendary Gerd Mueller since 1972 by one goal.

Bayern finished the last season with a ninth straight Bundesliga title, and have begun their campaign for even bigger victory, ranking first after five rounds this season.

""It's not over yet, we are still hungry for titles,"" said Lewandowski, who hopes to add a second Champions League title to the one he won with Bayern in 2020.

Bayern Munich president Herbert Hainer said: ""This is a great accolade for Robert Lewandowski. Not just for his many, many goals but for the exemplary professionalism with which he gives everything for success every day.""

Messi has won this award six times, and Ronaldo four.

""My mind completely went blank and all I could rely on was my muscle memory. The National Games are far more difficult than competing abroad, because the fastest two female climbers are in China,"" said Niu, adding that she hoped to bring the record to China upon returning to the international stage.

The event, due to be held in Guadalajara, Mexico after it was relocated from Shenzhen, China earlier this month, is typically contested by the top eight singles and doubles players of the year. The 2021 edition will also mark the 50th year anniversary of the singles event, and the 45th for the doubles.

""Lifting the Billie Jean King Trophy in Shenzhen in 2019 is one of the best moments of my career,"" Barty said after qualifying.

""It's a great honor to be among the top eight players in the world and be the first to qualify for the 2021 WTA Finals,"" she added.

Whether the world number one can participate however is still in doubt as she is ""physically and mentally exhausted,"" her coach Craig Tyzzer said in an interview with the Australian Associated Press.

Barty suffered an early exit from the U.S. Open this month, and both the high altitude and the timing of the Finals will be challenging, as she needs time to prepare for the Grand Slam she is aiming for: the 2022 Australian Open in January.

For Sabalenka and Krejcikova, this will be their first time taking part in the WTA Finals' singles event, although both have played before in the doubles.

The NBA is trying to negotiate a new broadcasting contract that could be worth as much as $75 billion, according to Jabari Young of CNBC. The current TV deal which began in 2016 and is due for renewal in 2025 is worth about $24 billion. That was a huge number when it was signed, and one of the consequences it led to was a dramatic rise in the salary cap from $70 million in the 2015-16 season to $84.1 million in the 2016-17 season. If the league can settle a new broadcasting contract worth $75 billion this time, teams may be looking at a $171-million salary cap for the 2025-26 season.

Chelsea crush Tottenham Chelsea powered to the top of the Premier League with an impressive 3-0 win against Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday. On an emotional day in north London, Chelsea and Tottenham paid tribute to their former striker Jimmy Greaves, who died aged 81 on Sunday. In a moving tribute, several former Tottenham greats, including Greaves' old teammate Martin Chivers, lined up on the touchline to join both teams and 62,000 people in the stands in a minute's applause. It was Chelsea who showed the predatory instincts that made Greaves Tottenham's record scorer with 266 goals in 379 appearances between 1961 and 1970. Greaves started his career with a prolific spell at Chelsea and netted 44 times in 57 appearances for England, featuring in their 1966 World Cup-winning squad.

It is about aggression and winning duels."" ""We spoke clearly about it at half-time. In the second half, it was a very good performance and a deserved win,"" he added.

When Xinjiang defeated Hubei in the penalty shootout at the end of the U20 men's football semifinal game at the Chinese National Games on Friday, Xinjiang's players made history by reaching the men's football final at the National Games for the first time in 62 years.

Though they lost to Zhejiang in the final 2-1 on Saturday, a silver medal is already the best proof that Xinjiang are one of the new reasons to continue to have faith in Chinese football.

Xinjiang's manager Parhat Azimat used to work was the assistant manager of the Chinese youth national team for a long time. That experience gave him a unique way of finding young talents. For example, Xinjiang's Nebijan Muhmet was the captain of China attending the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) U-20 Asian Cup qualifiers. Back Shewketjan Tayir was recruited by the Chinese youth team multiple times.

Moreover, football players from Xinjiang found their positions in multiple teams at the National Games and some of them are playing key roles. For instance, Abulahan Harik made great contributions for Shaanxi to winning to the U18 championship. The U18 Golden Boot winner Parmanjan Kyum is also from Xinjiang."

""It's been very successful National Games for her,"" said Ge Hongzhuan, Yang's coach. ""She is different to other athletes. To win two golds at the Olympics before winning two more at the National Games is a very difficult achievement. She is truly an outstanding athlete.""

Team China has been dominant in various shooting events for a long time. That's why domestic competitions are no easier than their international counterparts.

""The standard of shooting in our country is very high. It's just as high as in other international competitions,"" said Yang. ""In the women's individual 10-meter air rifle qualifying, one score of more than 630 didn't even get into the final. So I think our Chinese athletes are all very strong and some of them are in very good form.""

""Yang studies at Tsinghua University. She is an outstanding person to be able to study and train as an athlete. As coaches, we just follow basic routines and try to encourage all athletes to be well developed in all areas,"" Ge told CGTN.

There wasn't much time for Yang to switch her focus from the Tokyo Games to the National Games, especially with COVID-19 still present. However, the 20-year-old still managed to do it on short notice and had a great performance in Xi'an.

""Taking part in large-scale competitions like the Olympics and the National Games is a very valuable experience for all athletes. It's also good for our future development, but what's important to me, is that I get to learn how to maintain my normal standard of performance under stressful circumstances at stimulating competitions,"" said Yang."

Macao karateka Kuok Kin Hang made history on Saturday, delivering the Macao Special Administrative Region's first ever medal at China's National Games in the men's karate.

Kuok, a gold medalist at the 2013 East Asian Games, beat Song Zhengwang from Zhejiang Province to claim the bronze in the men's kata (routine) event.

This is the first time that a Macao athlete has stepped on the National Games podium since the region made its debut at China's quadrennial multi-sport event in 2001.

""I'm glad to take this honor. It's a special moment for Macao sports. It means that Macao athletes can do something on this big stage,"" said Kuok.

The 28-year-old was close to winning a medal at the 18th Asian Games in Jakarta, where he lost to South Korea's Park Hee-hun in the men's karate kata competition.

""I kept pushing myself and didn't eat too much yesterday. It's my first time competing at the National Games, and I was hungry to win a medal for my team,"" he said.

""I'm so glad to compete with other Chinese competitors on such a huge stage, since I haven't had any events outside Macao because of the pandemic,"" Kuok added."

Trayvon Bromell ran the fastest 100 meters of 2021 by winning the Kup Keino Classic in 9.76 seconds in Nairobi on Saturday.

Bromell was considered a title favorite before the Tokyo Olympics with his then world-leading time of 9.77 seconds but failed to reach the final of the men's 100 meters, clocking 10.00 in the semis.

The 26-year-old American got over the disappointment of the unsuccessful Olympics campaign in the final World Athletics Continental Tour Gold series event of the year. He finished faster than home favorite Kenyan athletics star Ferdinand Omanyala who finished in 9.77 seconds and set a new African record, smashing the previous record of 9.84 seconds set by Akani Simbine of South Africa.

""I may not have grabbed the gold in Tokyo, but where I come from, I've already won,"" Bromell said in an Instagram post.

""I pray that I can continue to show you all that no matter what you go through, no one on this Earth can control your fate.""

The 2004 Olympic champion Justin Gatlin came third in the ranking. He canceled his retirement plan afterward but retained the possibility of taking a long break coming back from injury.

""Hopefully, let's wait and see what's in store for the new season,"" he said when asked if he planned to hang up his spikes.

It has been never a secret that John Wall was never part of the Houston Rockets' future since the team traded Russell Westbrook for him in December 2020. The fact that the Washington Wizards had to add four (protected) first-round draft picks to convince the Rockets to accept Wall already proved that he is a negative asset. The peaceful parting agreement he reached with the Rockets was worth praising, but hardly made it any easier for the team to get rid of him. So, what's standing in the way of a 31-year-old five-time NBA All-Star point guard finding a new team to play for?

John Wall (C) of the Houston Rockets tries to penetrate in the game against the Washington Wizards at Captila One Arena in Washington, D.C., February 15, 2021. /CFP John Wall (C) of the Houston Rockets tries to penetrate in the game against the Washington Wizards at Captila One Arena in Washington, D.C., February 15, 2021. /CFP

First, it's his big contract. Wall still has two years left of his current deal and they are worth $91.7 million (player option in 2022 summer). His salary of $44.3 million for the 2021-22 season is the second-highest in the league, only next to the $45.8 million of Stephen Curry, more than what James Harden, Kevin Durant and LeBron James are paid. Wall averaged 20.6 points, 6.9 assists and 2.0 triples at 31.7 percent in 40 games last season. He did not play at all in the 2019-20 season due to injury. The same problem cost him 50 and 41 games respectively in the previous two seasons and took away Wall's biggest weapon, his speed which enabled him to finish 40-yard dash at 4.35 seconds. Moreover, Wall has never been a reliable shooter – either for catch-and-shoot or shoot off the dribble – since he joined the NBA in 2010. 2020-21 was already his most productive season at the 3-point line where he buried two shots per game, but at only 31.7 percent.

So it's safe to say that Wall's contribution today to his team can't match the money they pay him. A buyout does not sound likely either. For example, if Wall gives up $10 million and agrees to receive it for five years, that's over $16 million of dead space on the team's payroll for five years. It will deprive them of the ability to make any remarkable enhancements for a longer time than the rookie deal of a promising young man. No team will do that to themselves. It can be argued that in the NBA, many things are overpriced, especially when you are in desperate need for it. So are there any teams willing to bet on Wall for their solution to the point guard position? The Dallas Mavericks may be one. Luka Doncic is in the last years of his rookie deal and the team's bet on Kristaps Porzingis obviously failed. They need someone who can at least share the orchestrating burden with Doncic. Is it a good deal for Wall and Porzingis to switch sides?

The Rockets may not want that. Even if they keep Wall for another two seasons, they will still be able to clean huge salary space in 2023 summer when they will have no contract bigger than $10 million. Nonetheless, if the Rockets replace Wall with Porzingis, that's over $36 million of occupied space on their payroll for the 2023-24 season. The Los Angeles Clippers are another team that is one piece of puzzle away from the champion squad. But their salaries are already exploding ($167.5), not to mention that Kawhi Leonard will not play this season. How ridiculously excellent will Paul George have to be to convince the Clippers' front office that it's worth to burn money landing Wall? The Philadelphia 76ers also have their name related to Wall and they have a perfect trading match for Wall – Ben Simmons. But if you have been following trade rumors about Simmons, you should recall that the 76ers ask for an All-Star player and multiple (at least four) first-rounders in return. Is Wall an All-Star? Absolutely no. Are the Rockets willing to give multiple first-rounders? According to ESPN's Tim MacMahon, they don't even want to include one first-round pick in Wall trade.

One may also argue that there are teams in the league willing to swallow toxic contracts like the Oklahoma City Thunder or the Detroit Pistons. Unfortunately, there is a price for their help and it's too large for the Rockets to pay. If the Thunder take in Wall, which they are totally capable of, they will create a $30+million trade exception for the Rockets. It remains unclear how many future draft picks it make take for the Thunder to agree to do so, but it's more than enough to clean the Rockets' bank account for first-rounders. The Pistons won't be in any conversation with the Rockets because their salary space is already filled with dead money from buyout deals with Blake Griffin, Deandre Jordan and others.

Though Man City won the Premier League title in three of the past four seasons and reached the Champions League Final last season, they rarely saw a fully-seated home stadium, which separated them from other heavyweights like Liverpool, Chelsea and of course, Manchester United.

""The irony is that the club's financial forecasts show the emergence of a financially sustainable picture. Absent the COVID-19 pandemic, we undoubtedly would have been able to trade through. The club's revenues and cash flow took a circa £20 million ($27.4 million) hit.

""We cannot stress enough how devastating it is to be forced into this position. We will continue our work under the stewardship of the administrators to help facilitate their process and their effort to find a purchaser,"" it concluded."
739,Football legend Pele 'recovering well' after re-entering ICU,"Brazilian football legend Pele, 80, was briefly transferred back to an intensive care unit on Friday after suffering breathing difficulties but is now stable, said the Albert Einstein Hospital in Sao Paulo, where he underwent surgery earlier this month.

The transfer was a temporary ""preventative measure,"" the hospital said in a statement, adding that the sporting great was later transferred to ""semi-intensive care"" as he continues to recover from surgery for a suspected colon tumor.

""He is currently stable from a cardiovascular and respiratory point of view,"" it added.

Shortly afterwards, the ex-footballer posted a message on social media stating: ""Friends, I am still recovering very well. Today I received visits from family and I am still smiling every day.""

Pele's daughter Kely Nascimento also posted a photo of herself next to her father in the hospital, seeking to cheer up his fans.

""This is the normal recovery scenario for a man his age. After an operation like this, sometimes you take two steps forward, one step back,"" Nascimento wrote on Instagram next to the photo. ""Yesterday he was tired and he took a step back. Today, he has taken two steps forward,"" she added.

In the photo, Pele is seen on what looks like a hospital bed in a black puff vest or jacket, alert and smiling.

""He is recovering well, under normal conditions, I promise!"" Nascimento added. ""There is a lot of angst in the world these days and we don't want to add to it.""

On September 6 the hospital said Pele had undergone surgery for a suspected colon tumor.

He originally left the ICU unit on Tuesday, telling his fans on social media that he was feeling happier by the day and was looking forward to reuniting with them.

The suspected tumor was detected during routine tests, according to the hospital, where Pele has been undergoing treatment since August 31.

Considered by many to be the greatest footballer of all time, Pele, whose real name is Edson Arantes do Nascimento, has been in poor health in recent years, and has had various stints in the hospital.

The only player in history to win three World Cups (1958, 1962 and 1970), Pele burst onto the global stage at just 17 with dazzling goals, including two in the final against hosts Sweden, as Brazil won the World Cup for the first time in 1958.

Four years later, Pele gave a tantalizing glimpse of his ability with an electric individual goal against Mexico in Brazil's opening 2-0 win. He went on to have one of the most storied careers in sport, scoring more than 1,000 goals before retiring in 1977."

Rio de Janeiro in Brazil prepares to bid for the rights to host this year's FIFA Club World Cup, according to an official of the city on Thursday.

It is now unclear what city will take over the baton from Japan, after the Japanese Football Association announced it will relinquish its hosting rights due to COVID-19 concerns.

Brazil recently eased its COVID-19 restrictions amid a fall in infection rates and fatalities caused by the virus, whereas the Japanese government decided last week to extend the COVID-19 state of emergency in many parts of the country as it hoped to suppress the latest wave of infections.

""We are starting talks so that the final of the Club World Cup can be held [here],"" Rio's finance and planning secretary Pedro Paulo told Band News.

According to Paulo, should the city be granted the opportunity, the matches will likely be held at the Maracana and Olympic stadiums.

Three clubs have already qualified for this year's Club World Cup, including Al-Ahly, Chelsea and Auckland City as the champions of Africa, Europe and Oceania, respectively. The competition will also feature the winners of this year's continental club tournaments in Asia, South America and North and Central America and the Caribbean, as well as the reigning champions of the host nation's top league."

Chen defeated Olympic semi-finalist He Bingjiao 2-0, and became the first female athlete in the history of the National Games to defend the badminton women's singles title.

Olympic gold medalists Wang Yilyu and Huang Dongping had to put up a fight in the third set to deny the other duo, Zheng Siwei and Huang Yaqiong from taking over the match, after Zheng and Huang came back fiercely from one set down and tied the match at 1-1.

Beijing 2022 on Friday sent out warm invitations worldwide with the unveiling of ""Together for a Shared Future"" as its official motto.

An expert panel selected the motto from 79 proposals submitted since May 2020 and finalized after repeated discussions.

As the Beijing 2022 organizers explained, ""Together"" depicts how mankind stays strong when facing adversities and points out the solution to overcome those difficulties and create a better future; ""For a shared future"" embodies a vision for a better life and conveys hope and confidence.

""The motto advocates a universal goal of unity, peace, progress and inclusiveness. It's the Chinese interpretation of the newly revised Olympic motto of 'Faster, Higher, Stronger - Together,'"" Beijing 2022 said in a press release.

Chen Jining, Beijing mayor and the executive president of the Beijing 2022 Organizing Committee (BOCOG), expressed his belief that the release of the motto will attract more people to pay attention to Beijing 2022 and join in efforts to deliver a successful Games under the COVID-19 pandemic.

""It embeds our aspiration that people around the world could strengthen solidarity, support each other and join hands for a better future,"" he noted.

Chen Ning, director of the BOCOG's culture and ceremonies department, underlined that the motto is in line with China's initiative of building a community with a shared future for humanity, reflects the common aspiration worldwide of joining hands for a better future, especially facing the COVID-19 challenges, and the core value and vision of the Olympic Movement.

""Beijing will become the first city to host both summer and winter Olympics. This motto carries on the legacy from 'One World One Dream' of Beijing 2008, and reveals the characteristics of this era,"" he said.

He was echoed by Jiang Xiaoyu, vice president of the Beijing Olympic City Development Association, who believes the motto is a call from China.

""The motto of the 2008 games conveys China's view of the world. This time it takes a step further, not only shares our view but voices our attitude. It is more appealing and more passionate,"" he commented.

The Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics will run between February 4 and 20, with the Winter Paralympics following between March 4 and 13."
743,FIFA throws weight behind biennial World Cup plan with new survey,"While a number of high-profile players, coaches and even UEFA, football's European governing body, have expressed strong disapproval of the radical proposal to hold a World Cup every two years, FIFA still refuses to back down. In an attempt to validate the feasibility of a biennial World Cup, football's world governing body unveiled a survey carried out by polling company YouGov on Thursday and highlighted the fact that the majority of respondents are in favor of increasing the frequency of World Cups. The survey involved 23,000 people in 23 countries, across the organisation's six confederations. Of those, 15,000 respondents ""were identified as expressing an interest in football and the World Cup,"" with 55 percent in favor of a World Cup every one, two or three years, according to FIFA. ""There are considerable differences between the so-called traditional markets and the developing football markets; and younger generations in all regions are more open and interested in change than older generations,"" it said in a statement, adding that an expanded survey involving over 100,000 people in more than 100 countries ""is currently underway.""

Last week, UEFA President Aleksander Ceferin warned that his confederation could boycott the World Cup if the plan went ahead. ""We can decide not to play in it,"" he told The Times. ""As far as I know the South Americans are on the same page, so good luck with a World Cup like that.""



""I think it will never happen as it is so much against the basic principles of football. To play every summer a one-month tournament, for the players it's a killer. If it's every two years it clashes with the Women's World Cup, with the Olympic football tournament. The value is precisely because it is every four years, you wait for it. It's like the Olympic Games, it's a huge event. I don't see our federations supporting that,"" he added.



""I hope they (FIFA) will come to their senses because I don't see the right approach to go everywhere except the confederations, not to speak to us. They didn't come, they didn't call, I didn't get a letter or anything. I just read in the media,"" Ceferin fumed.



The stance was echoed by global players' union FIFPRO, which announced via a statement that it would not endorse any individual reforms such as shortening the gap between World Cups in isolation without an overarching review of the men's and women's calendar.

""Without the agreement of the players, who bring all competitions to life on the pitch, no such reforms will have the required legitimacy,"" read the statement."

The referee shows a red card to Leicester City's Nigerian midfielder Wilfred Ndidi (#25) during their Europa League clash with Napoli at the King Power Stadium in Leicester, England, September 16, 2021. /CFP

Victor Osimhen scored twice as Napoli came from 2-0 down to salvage a 2-2 draw at Leicester, while Lyon cruised to a 2-0 win at Rangers on the opening night of the Europa League group stages on Thursday.

Earlier, Celtic threw away a two-goal lead to lose 4-3 to Real Betis and West Ham were convincing 2-0 winners away to Dinamo Zagreb.

Leicester just missed out on Champions League football for a second consecutive season as they finished fifth in the Premier League last term. But the Foxes are keen to go further than their run to the last 32 of the Europa League last season and got off to a great start against the Italian giants.

Ayoze Perez fired home at the back post from Harvey Barnes' cross after just nine minutes. Patson Daka then saw his first Leicester goal ruled out by a VAR review for a marginal offside call, but Barnes quickly put that disappointment behind Brendan Rodgers' men with an excellent finish to double Leicester's lead.

Napoli boss Luciano Spalletti held nothing in reserve with his strongest side and the visitors responded in the final quarter thanks to Osimhen.

The Nigerian, who cost $83 million from Lille last year, brilliantly flicked the ball over the imposing presence of Jannik Vestegaard and Kasper Schmeichel to get Napoli back in the game.

Osimhen then outjumped Caglar Soyuncu to power home a head for a deserved equalizer. And Leicester's night got even worse in stoppage time when Wilfred Ndidi was sent off in stoppage time for a second bookable offence."
745,Denver Nuggets will need to outscore their opponents in new season,"Nikola Jokic of the Denver Nuggets talks to the referee in Game 4 of the NBA Western Conference semifinals against the Phoenix Suns at Ball Arena in Denver, Colorado, U.S., June 13, 2021. /CFP Nikola Jokic of the Denver Nuggets talks to the referee in Game 4 of the NBA Western Conference semifinals against the Phoenix Suns at Ball Arena in Denver, Colorado, U.S., June 13, 2021. /CFP

The Denver Nuggets gave a four-year, $92-million contract extension to Aaron Gordon, according to the Undefeated's Marc J. Spears, who talked to Gordon's agent Calvin Andrews of Klutch Sports. That became the last major move of the team during this offseason. Before that, the Nuggets also retained Austin Rivers, JaMychal Green, Will Barton and added Jeff Green and JaVale McGee to their roster. Meanwhile, they let Paul Millsap depart for the Brooklyn Nets. Simply speaking, the Nuggets made an upgrade on offense at the cost of defense.

The arrival of Jeff Green enriched the team's offensive weapons. He was able to get 14.7 points, 5.2 rebounds and two triples at 41.2 percent per 36 minutes last season with the Nets. He's a more efficient scoring option than Millsap. Considering that Jeff Green will probably start off the bench, his screen plays with Facundo Campazzo could be very smooth with his impressive rolling techniques. The team will also have Jamal Murray back, who suffered a torn ACL in his left knee in April. If he returns 100 percent healthy, Murray is able to take the Nuggets' offense to another level. His incredible off-the-dribble shooting ability plus the screen-setting and passing skills of Nikola Jokic will make one of the sharpest pick-and-roll duos in today's NBA. One of the reasons the Nuggets were knocked out by the Phoenix Suns in the playoffs last season was that they had no reliable perimeter scoring options when Jokic's isolation threat was resolved by Deandre Ayton.

However, the Nuggets are very likely to be a below-average team defensively in the 2021-22 season. They allowed 110.1 points (eighth of all 30 teams) per game with a defensive rating of 112.1 (12th of 30). The team will probably keep the starting lineup of Murray, Barton, Michael Porter Jr., Gordon and Jokic in the new season, the same from 2020-21. The problem is with the bench squad. When Millsap was still with the Nuggets, he could make consistent contributions in stealing, blocking and switch defense. Jeff Green was unable to provide any of that. Of course, McGee can fill the paint, but he only received an average of 13.5 minutes per game last season, not to mention he lacks shooting range and the ability to switch on defense.

Snatch: 89 kg, 94 kg and 96 kg

Clean and jerk: 111 kg, 116 kg and 118 kg.

Though Hou's performance is unlikely to be recognized as the new world record because it did not happen at an international event, it's a solid proof that she is the top athlete in the category.

There's more good news for the Chinese weightlifting team in Thursday's competitions as they saw an incredible performance from the young generation. Jiang Huihua finished at 213 kg and came so close to defeat Hou, and 19-year-old Wang Jiali came third, lifting a total of 205 kg."

Olympic champion Simone Biles and other top American gymnasts excoriated U.S. sports officials and the FBI in powerful Senate testimony on Wednesday for failing to act promptly on complaints about Larry Nassar, the former team doctor convicted of serial sexual abuse. ""We have been failed, and we deserve answers,"" said the 24-year-old Biles, a seven-time Olympic medalist and the most decorated gymnast in world championships history. ""To be clear, I blame Larry Nassar, but I also blame an entire system that enabled and perpetrated his abuse,"" she said during an emotional hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Nassar, 58, was sentenced to life in prison in 2018 after pleading guilty to sexually assaulting women and girls while working as a team doctor at USA Gymnastics and Michigan State University (MSU). USA Gymnastics reported Nassar to the FBI in July 2015, but he continued to work at MSU and sexually abused at least 70 more women until a newspaper exposed him in September 2016 Biles and the three other gymnasts, McKayla Maroney, Aly Raisman and Maggie Nichols, testified that they were let down by the FBI, the leadership of USA Gymnastics and the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee (USOPC).

""Not only did the FBI not report my abuse,"" Maroney said. ""But when they eventually documented my report 17 months later, they made entirely false claims about what I said. They allowed a child molester to go free for more than a year. They had legal, legitimate evidence of child abuse and did nothing."" Hundreds of women, including Olympians and collegiate athletes, have accused Nassar of sexually abusing them over the course of his more than two-decade career in sports medicine.

The Justice Department's Inspector General published a scathing report in July about the mishandling of the accusations against Nassar by the FBI's field office in Indianapolis, where USA Gymnastics has its headquarters. FBI agents failed to take the allegations seriously and investigate them right away, the report said. Biles, Maroney, Raisman and Nichols were invited to testify before the Senate committee under oath about the ""FBI's dereliction of duty in the Nassar case."" Raisman, former captain of the Olympic gold medal-winning 2012 and 2016 U.S. teams, said stopping Nassar's abuse should have been a priority for the FBI, but it took over 14 months for the bureau to contact her. Raisman said the delay was ""like serving innocent children up to a pedophile on a silver platter.""

""And I am especially sorry that there were people at the FBI who had their own chance to stop this monster back in 2015 and failed. That is inexcusable.""

750,China's fervor for sports continues with opening of 'mini Olympics',"00:22

The passion for sports in China reached a new height on Wednesday evening as the country's most important multisport event kicked off in Xi'an, capital of northwest China's Shaanxi Province.



""I declare open the 14th National Games of the People's Republic of China,"" Chinese President Xi Jinping announced at the opening ceremony of the quadrennial Games, dubbed as China's ""mini Olympics.""



The event comes amid a busy national sporting calendar. At the Tokyo Olympics from July to August, China won 38 golds, 32 silvers and 18 bronzes, equaling its haul of gold medals at London 2012 for the best performance at an overseas Olympics. The country topped the medal tally at the Tokyo Paralympic Games that concluded earlier this month with 207 medals (96 golds, 60 silvers and 51 bronzes).



Moreover, Beijing will host the Winter Olympic Games in next February and become the first city to host both summer and winter Olympics.

'True champion'

Inaugurated in 1959, the National Games is the most prestigious domestic sporting gala in China. Under the theme of ""Games for All, Together in Mind and Action,"" the 14th National Games features a total of 54 sports and 595 events, of which 35 sports and 410 events are for elite athletes, with the remainder mass sports programs.



More than 12,000 athletes representing China's provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions, the Hong Kong and Macao Special Administrative Regions, the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps and specific sporting associations will compete at the Games, which will run through to September 27.

Chinese President Xi Jinping greets individuals and groups advancing China's sporting cause, both professionals and amateurs, as well as representatives of the athletes and coaches from the Chinese Olympic delegation for Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games, in Xi'an, capital of northwest China's Shaanxi Province, September 15, 2021. /Xinhua Chinese President Xi Jinping greets individuals and groups advancing China's sporting cause, both professionals and amateurs, as well as representatives of the athletes and coaches from the Chinese Olympic delegation for Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games, in Xi'an, capital of northwest China's Shaanxi Province, September 15, 2021. /Xinhua

It was the third time that President Xi has attended the opening ceremony of the Games since becoming Chinese president in 2013.



A keen sports fan, he is interested in a variety of sports, including soccer, volleyball and swimming. He has placed sports high on his agenda during his activities inside the country and abroad. He has visited venues for the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics, met with representatives of the Chinese women's volleyball team, attended the opening ceremony of the Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics, and watched a youth soccer match in Germany.



He has also talked with the world's top sports officials such as International Olympic Committee (IOC) President Thomas Bach, president of the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) Gianni Infantino and president of the International Basketball Federation (FIBA) Horacio Muratore.



""President Xi is a true champion and I want to give him a set of medals because he has a clear vision about the important role of sports in society, and the importance of sports for education for the young people. So in this respect, he is the true Olympic champion for the youth,"" Bach told reporters when Xi paid a visit to the IOC headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland in 2017.

Sports powerhouse

Since winning its first Olympic gold medal in 1984, China has made remarkable progress in sports – not just in competitions, but among hundreds of millions of ordinary Chinese.



The hosting major international sporting events, including the Beijing 1990 Asian Games, the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games and the 2015 World Championships in Athletics, has greatly boosted fervor for sports among the public, as has the development of professional sports leagues in China.

Argentine star Messi lined up with both Neymar and Kylian Mbappe for the first time, after being limited to just 24 minutes in a PSG shirt since his shock exit from Barcelona.

Ander Herrera, who scored twice in the weekend win over Clermont, gave PSG the lead by steering in Mbappe's cross on 15 minutes, but Brugge soon leveled through Hans Vanaken.

Messi curled against the bar from the corner of the area but PSG then lost Mbappe to injury and had to settle for a point against a team viewed as makeweights in a demanding Group A."

Robert Lewandowski and Thomas Mueller fired Bayern Munich to a 3-0 victory over Barcelona in a season opener of the Champions League on Tuesday.

Mueller gave Bayern the lead in the 34th minute with a strike from outside the area which deflected off Barca defender Eric Garcia to confound goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen.

Lewandowski scored the second goal in the 54th, tapping into the net from close range on the rebound after Jamal Musiala had hit the post as Bayern made a rampant start following the interval, hemming their hosts into their own half.

The Polish striker twisted the knife further into Barcelona by scoring again in the 85th, collecting the ball in the area after another shot had come back off the post and tormenting the defense before calmly beating Ter Stegen."

British sprinter Chijindu Ujah's B-sample from the Tokyo Olympics has been tested positive, the International Testing Agency (ITA) said on Tuesday, confirming his previous test result of A-sample containing two banned substances, Ostarine and S-23, a week after the Games ended. Ujah has been provisionally suspended since.

Both substances are classified by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) as selective androgen receptor modulator (SARM) with effects similar to anabolic steroids.

CJ Ujah was a member of the Team GB men's 4x100m team along with Zharnel Hughes, Richard Kilty and Nethaneel Mitchell-Blake, who won silver in Tokyo. They are now at risk of losing the medal.

Ujah's case has been referred to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). Should the ban be upheld, next in line to be upgraded for the silver and bronze medals, respectively, are Team Canada and Team China, that finished third and fourth in the event's final at the Tokyo Olympics.

""The CAS Anti-Doping Division will consider the matter of the finding of an Anti-Doping Rule Violation (ADRV) and the disqualification of the men's 4x100 relay results of the Great Britain team,"" the ITA said in a statement.

""In this regard, pursuant to the IOC ADR (International Olympic Committee Anti-Doping Rules) and the World Athletics Anti-Doping Rules: 'where the athlete who has committed an Anti-Doping Rule Violation competed as a member of a relay team, the relay team shall be automatically disqualified from the event in question'.""

""The case will then be referred to the Athletics Integrity Unit (World Athletics) to follow up on sanctions beyond the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020.""

757,Will Chicago Bulls make any difference with 3 NBA All-Stars?,"L-R: Nikola Vucevic, Zach LaVine and DeMar DeRozan, the new Big 3 of the Chicago Bulls. /CFP L-R: Nikola Vucevic, Zach LaVine and DeMar DeRozan, the new Big 3 of the Chicago Bulls. /CFP

The Chicago Bulls are definitely after something big, landing DeMar DeRozan, Lonzo Ball and Alex Caruso during the off-season, bigger than convincing Zach LaVine to sign a contract extension when they traded for Nikola Vucevic in the second half of last season. It may not sound like it, but the Bulls have their own version of the ""Big 3"" now: DeRozan: four-time NBA All-Star, All-NBA Second Team and Third Team once each Vucevic: two-time All Star LaVine: All-Star

Zach LaVine (#8) of the Chicago Bulls drives toward the rim in the game against the Toronto Raptors at United Center in Chicago, Illoinois, U.S., May 13, 2021. /CFP Zach LaVine (#8) of the Chicago Bulls drives toward the rim in the game against the Toronto Raptors at United Center in Chicago, Illoinois, U.S., May 13, 2021. /CFP

If you put Ball into the starting lineup, you will see the Bulls have four starters with the following stats from the 2020-21 season: Ball: 14.6 points, 4.8 rebounds, 5.7 assists, 1.6 steals and 3.1 triples at 37.8 percent per game LaVine: 27.4 points, 5.0 rebounds, 4.9 assists and 3.4 triples at 41.9 percent per game DeRozan: 21.6 points, 4.2 rebounds and 6.9 assists per game Vucevic: 21.5 points, 11.5 rebounds, 3.9 assists and 2.3 triples at 38.8 percent Moreover, the playstyles of the four fit each other quite well. LaVine is the productive scorer who can ignore defense; DeRozan is the isolation choice in the middle range with decent orchestrating ability; Ball is a big point guard who doesn't have to hold the ball in his hands too much and a reliable 3-point shooter; Vucevic has the complete offensive weapons of a big man and he can stretch the spacing for the team. Bulls fans will no doubt be eager for the new season to begin now.

But there are reasons why they shouldn't get too excited. For example, of the four only Vucevic played five playoff games in the past two seasons. The other three played a grand total of zero. DeRozan only had one ""plus"" season in Defensive Box Plus/Minus (DBPM), having played 12 years in the NBA. LaVine had none. Both must be on the court for at least 35 minutes per game for the sake of the team's offense. Things look even worse if you go into the details. Vucevic was exposed as more of a guy to tussle with the opponents' big man for rebounding instead of a true rim protector. LaVine has never been a qualified defender in his career; neither has DeRozan, not to mention that he will have to play as a small forward and face guys who are always bigger and stronger than him. Usually it takes an elite defender in the power forward position to save such a squad, but the Bulls have no player of this type.

Neither are they able to make a balanced squad. As mentioned earlier, LaVine, DeRozan, Ball and Vucevic are likely to appear in the starting squad. But the question is, who will join them? Caruso should be considered in this but he is a back-court player, just like Ball, LaVine and DeRozan. Derrick Jones Jr. may be another option but he is still undersized to play as a power forward. There is more cold water to be thrown on Bulls fans if they look at the environment in the Eastern Conference. The Brooklyn Nets, led by Kevin Durant, James Harden and Kyrie Irving, the defending champions Milwaukee Bucks, plus Joel Embiid and the Philadelphia 76ers will occupy the top three spots of this conference. The Miami Heat may not match those three teams but they are above the rest in the East. Trae Young and the Atlanta Hawks just made the Eastern Finals last season and they have kept a very young, competitive roster. The New York Knicks were No. 4 in the regular season and had a top-2 defense of the league. The Boston Celtics are in an awkward situation but their star duo, Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown have a way more balanced combination of offense and defense than DeRozan-LaVine. That's already seven teams that are surely better than the Bulls. The NBA will continue to arrange a play-in tournament for playoff qualification. That means the Bulls may face the Indiana Pacers, the Washington Wizards or the Charlotte Hornets. How confident are the Bulls that they can absolutely beat any of the three in a one-game series?

Jia Xiuquan, manager of the Chinese women's national football team, is set to resign and the Chinese Football Association (CFA) has already started looking for a successor, domestic newspaper Football reported on Tuesday. Jia is currently on vacation after the Tokyo Olympics. Most of the national team's players will attend the Chinese National Games, kicking off Wednesday in Xi'an, northwest China's Shaanxi Province, with Shui Qingxia as manager, Football reported. Whether Shui could become Jia's replacement was unclear. China's performance in Tokyo under Jia was disastrous: losing to Brazil 5-0, to the Netherlands 8-2 and then forced into a 4-4 draw against Zambia.

Jia had brought many young players to Tokyo, rather than veteran core members, defending his decision by calling the Olympics a drill. This could cost him his job as manager of the national team, although Jia himself has not said much about his future in the coaching position.

Formula One's governing body will investigate Sunday's Italian Grand Prix crash between title contenders Max Verstappen and Lewis Hamilton because it was 'unusual,' according to race director Michael Masi.

Masi said although the collision was relatively low-speed, the FIA's safety experts would still look into it.

""Incidents that are different, so it's not necessarily high G impacts or anything like that, but are unusual, we do look at,"" said Masi.

The crash had Verstappen's Red Bull lift up off a curb and land on Hamilton's Mercedes with the inside of a rear wheel hitting the seven-time world champion's helmet through the protective halo.

""Our safety department does look at them in detail, investigate and see what we can learn and what we can improve for the future. That's how we have a whole lot of the safety features that we have today and will continue to evolve into the future.""

""We are already collecting all of the data, so we have all of the information, and that will all go to our safety department together with any photographs and anything else we have along the way.""

The Monza stewards blamed championship leader Verstappen and handed the Dutch 23-year-old a three-place grid drop for the next race in Russia.

Hamilton said it had been a shock to be hit on the head and that the titanium ring had saved his life.

""I'm so, so grateful that I'm still here. I feel incredibly blessed. I feel like someone was watching over me today,"" said the Briton.

Several other F1 drivers have also credited the device for saving their lives over the past years, including Ferrari's Charles Leclerc and former Haas racer Romain Grosjean.

""I think it's the greatest thing that we brought to Formula One,"" said Grosjean after the device shielded his head when his car crashed into the barriers in a fiery crash in Bahrain last year.

The ATP Finals of 2021 saw two latest players joining the list, including U.S. Open champion Daniil Medvedev of Russia and Greek Stefanos Tsitsipas, according to the organizers on Monday. This year's edition will be held in Turin, Italy from November 14 to 21.

Each year, the top eight men's singles and doubles players qualify for the season-ending event. Medvedev earned his berth after denying world number one Novak Djokovic's hope of achieving a calendar-year Grand Slam in New York.

""I look forward to trying and defending my title in Turin,"" Medvedev said in an ATP statement. ""Italian fans are so passionate; I am sure it will be a great event.""

Djokovic has already qualified for the finals, before anyone else, after clinching all three other Grand Slam titles this year in the Australian Open, French Open and Wimbledon Championships. Djokovic has won the finals five times.

World number two Tsitsipas, who won the ATP Finals in 2019, has again joined the competition.

""It is great to qualify for Turin so early; I can't wait to play there,"" said Tsitsipas, who has won a tour-leading 50 matches in the 2021 season.

Germany's Tokyo Olympic gold medalist Alexander Zverev, Russian Andrey Rublev and Italian Matteo Berrettini are next in line to qualify for the event.

Cornerback Marshon Lattimore has agreed to a five-year, $97.6-million contract extension offered by the New Orleans Saints, according to ESPN's Adam Schefter. The new deal contains $68.3 million of guaranteed money, the largest full guarantee at signing for any player in Lattimore's position in NFL history.

Keeping one of the team's core players plus the 38-3 big win over the Green Bay Packers in the season opener gave Packers fans more reasons to cheer. The day could have been better if Lattimore had not suffered a thumb injury in Sunday's game. He did not start at the beginning of the third quarter and was spotted with a brace on his hand when he returned.

The Saints managed to retain several key members of their roster despite facing severe salary-cap limitations.

In professional tennis, much like other elite sports, the ""shelf life"" is short – just ask the seasoned veterans who fell victim to the 18-year-old British sensation Emma Raducanu's ruthless backhand and serve. However, from time to time, experience triumphs over youth.



With the combined age of 69, China's 32-year-old Zhang Shuai and Aussie old-timer Samantha Stosur, ensured that the changing of the guard would not happen in the women's doubles final at this year's rejuvenated U.S. Open, as the pair produced a near-flawless performance to outclass American teens Coco Gauff and Catherine McNally 6-3, 3-6, 6-3 on Sunday night.

Fabinho doubled his side’s lead early in the second half, firing in a rebound from close-range after a Virgil van Dijk attempt had been blocked.

Things got worse for the hosts on the hour mark as substitute Pascal Struijk saw red for a robust challenge on Harvey Elliott, who was stretched out of the game by medics.

Russell, 87, was inducted into the HOF for the second time as coach after receiving the honor as a player, making him the first person to enter the HOF with such a distinction. Russell became the African American head coach in NBA history and led the Boston Celtics to win the NBA Championship in 1968 as a player-coach and then won it again in 1969. ""This honor would never be possible without my great friend, Red Auerbach. Red was a visionary. When he first asked me if I wanted to coach the Boston Celtics, I wondered, 'Could I coach Bill Russell?' Coaching the Celtics was one of the most challenging and rewarding experiences I had through my 13 years in the NBA. I had (chosen) Hall of Fame presenters who each hold a special place in my life and who I take great pride in playing a role in their lives. We are missing two important presenters: David Stern and Kobe Bryant, whose friendships meant a lot to me. And to my wife, Jeannine, thank you for putting up with me and for your love and support. Thank you,"" said Russell in a recorded statement. He walked onto the stage with the help of Julius Erving in front of his presenters: Charles Barkley, Spencer Haywood, Alonzo Mourning, Bill Walton and Rick Welts.

""Hey, Chris Weber, we're going into the Hall of Fame with Bill Russell, bro. That's crazy,"" said Bosh. Bosh and Webber were 11-time and five-time All-Star power forwards respectively when they were playing. Webber was also a five-time All-NBA Team selection (First Team once, Second Team three times and Third Team once) but Bosh had two rings, which he won with the Miami Heat as one of the Big 3 with LeBron James and Dwyane Wade. Both James and Wade attended the ceremony. Back in 2010 summer, when Pat Riley was trying to recruit Bosh for the Heat, he presented all of the seven rings he had won (before 2010) and gave one of them to Bosh ""on loan."" Riley said he could return it after they won a title together. After that, Bosh won two rings in Miami and he was finally able to give it back to Riley.

One unfortunate part of Bosh's career was that he had to retire at 31 because of blood clots. ""After finally making it to the mountaintop with so much more to do, in my mind, so much more work to do, it all stopped. I eventually came to realize that we all have it in our power to make the most out of every day despite what happens, to turn setbacks into strengths,"" Bosh said in his speech. Bosh also paid respect to Kobe Bryant, recalling his time in Las Vegas with Team USA ahead of the Summer Olympics in Beijing. Bosh wanted to ""establish himself as a young leader of the team"" by ""waking up bright and early."" ""So I set my alarm, I make sure I'm up by sunrise, I get out of my bed, I put on my gear and I head down stairs. But when I get there, Kone is already there, with ice bags on his knees, drenched in sweat. It took me a minute to figure it out but this guy wasn't only awake before me. He had already worked out. He had just played in the Finals days earlier. Meanwhile, I have been off for months but I was still exhausted. What he had done that morning was incomprehensible to me. That dedication he had only days after falling short of an NBA Championship. That taught me something I've never forgotten. Legends aren't defined by their successes, they're defined by how they bounce back from their failures,"" said Bosh.

Pierce was drafted by the Celtics with the 10th overall pick in 1998, and he still gets choked up about that to this day. ""I appreciate that. Thank you for passing on me. It added fuel to my fire. To this day I don't understand how I slipped to No. 10. But you know everything happened for a reason. Going to the Celtics, I'm grateful,"" said Pierce. He also recalled the days working with Coach Doc Rivers, who led him to the only title of his career in 2008. ""We didn't start off on the best foot. I know you wanted to trade me. I was accustomed to doing things my way, I didn't like someone coming and telling me what to do. When I started listening to you, that's when I became great,"" added Pierce. Others gave food for thought in their speeches too. ""I would like to thank Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen for kicking my butt during the Olympics in Barcelona and motivating me to work even harder to become an important part of the Chicago Bulls,"" said Kukoc, who won three straight rings with the Chicago Bulls between 1996 and 1998. ""I was unknown. I came out of nowhere. I never gave up on my dreams and here I am at the pinnacle, the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame,"" said Griffith, who was the former WNBA MVP, DPOY and Finals MVP.

Editor's note: Daryl Guppy is an international financial technical analysis expert. He has provided weekly Shanghai Index analysis for media for the Chinese mainland for more than a decade. Guppy appears regularly on CNBC Asia and is known as ""The Chart Man."" He is a national board member of the Australia China Business Council. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

The world recoiled in horror when the remains of at least 750 children were unearthed at the site of a former residential school in Saskatchewan, Canada. First Nations people were unsurprised after telling their horrifying stories of child abuse in the ""Mush Hole""at the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. Their treatment is part of a consistent pattern of child abuse applied not just to First Nations people, but as a consequence of the way religion shaped the structure and implementation of these child removal policies.

The Canadian experience is replicated in the United States and Australia. Without doubt the same conditions have applied in other countries colonized by Europeans in Africa and Asia.

Understanding how we got to this situation starts with the concept of those who can be saved and those whose souls are irremediable. These religious influences cannot be separated from the formulation and implementation of secular policy that in turn handed the operation of orphanages and boarding schools to religious orders.

The Catholic orders in Ireland and the way in which a segment of society – unwed mothers – was selected and punished for religious transgressions sets a template for the treatment of First Nations people. This was the punishment of a group rejected by religious society and resulted in 9,000 child deaths in Ireland's church-run homes for unwed mothers.

This same philosophy of the saved and the irredeemable underpinned many of the interactions with indigenous people in Canada, Australia, the United States, Indonesia and elsewhere.

Colonization involved elimination, exploitation and assimilation – what the Canadian Truth and Reconciliation Commission called ""cultural genocide."" First was the physical elimination of any of the adult native population that opposed colonization. This includes the long-running American Indian wars. It defines the Zulu wars and native wars in Africa waged by the Dutch and other European colonizers.

Crushing resistance enabled exploitation. Cultural elimination and assimilation followed, with the intention of converting the indigenous child population into lesser members of the dominant culture. These objectives were always framed as being for their own good and to bring them into a civilized environment. This purpose was often subverted by a overlay that sought not just civilization, but religious conversions. Children who resisted were not worthy of the effort, and by a perverse logic, were able to be treated in a separate world that had few ethics and a lesser standard of morality."

A guide in such event is known as a ""tapper"" because they tap the para-swimmer's head or body with a tapping device to signal the start or finish of the race.

Cristiano Ronaldo scored twice against Newcastle United on his return to Manchester United on Saturday as the Red Devils ran out 4-1 winners.

The Portuguese was named in the starting line up by manager Ole Gunnar Solskjær two weeks after he agreed to a return to his former club from Juventus.

His first goal came on the stroke of half-time, sparking an uproar from Manchester United fans whose excitement has remained on a high since the announcement of the reunion.

Mason Greenwood, who had scored in all previous three games for his side, sent a low shot which Freddie Woodman couldn't hold on to, and Ronaldo was there to tap the rebound in right next to the helpless keeper.

Newcastle pulled one back through Javier Manquillo in the 56th minute, but the score did not remain so for long as Ronaldo latched onto a pass from Luke Shaw to power a shot past Woodman.

Fellow Portuguese star Bruno Fernandes added a sublime third 10 minutes from time, and there was still enough time for substitute Jesse Lingard to add a fourth for the side.

The win took Manchester United on top of the Premier League standings provisionally, ahead of Chelsea's clash with Aston Villa later on Saturday, with Liverpool and Everton also yet to play."

Football legend Edson Arantes do Nascimento, better known as Pele, remained in intensive care on Friday as the Brazilian star recovered from surgery to remove a tumor on the right side of his colon.

Hospital Albert Einstein in Sao Paulo said in a statement that the 80-year-old was recovering ""in a satisfactory manner,"" though still in intensive care. The hospital had said on September 6 that Pele was expected to be moved to a regular ward on September 7.

The hospital also said Pele is ""awake, actively talking and keeping his vital signs in normality.""

The three-time World Cup winner also said on his Instagram that ""each day I feel a little better.""

He went to the hospital for routine exams at the end of August when the tumor was found. The hospital said in a statement then that the tumor was identified during routine cardiovascular and laboratory exams. It added it collected samples to be analyzed but has not released the results.

Pele, the only male footballer to win three World Cups, has had mobility problems since a failed hip replacement surgery in 2012. He has been forced to use walkers and wheelchairs in public. He has also been admitted to several hospitals in recent years for kidney and prostate procedures.

Winning the 1958, 1962 and 1970 World Cups, Pele remains Brazil's all-time leading scorer with 77 goals in 92 matches.

Pele's international record was overtaken by Lionel Messi of Argentina on Thursday, as Messi scored a hat-trick to become the top international goalscorer in South American football history.

The sleds, in two and four seats, have been developed with the input of more than a dozen Chinese companies in less than 200 days, including firms involved in the automotive and aerospace industries.

""China Aerospace was mainly involved in the design of the sleds' surface material and aerodynamic configuration. We performed comprehensive analysis and design based on the needs of athletes,"" said Yang Wenli, a project management director at China FAW Group Corporation, a leading automotive company in the country.

The sleds have gone through the most intricate aerodynamic tests with at least 10 major parts optimized during the R&D period.

""The task is a new challenge for us as the time is limited and there are many difficulties to solve,"" said Jia Yi, a senior expert on low-speed wind tunnel at China Academy of Aerospace Aerodynamics.

""All the materials that we use for the sleds are made in China, like the T800 level carbon fiber composite which is even advanced in aerospace,”said Zhou Yu, a material specialist from China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology.

Designers say the sleds' speed can exceed 160 kilometers per hour, making it among the fastest in the world.

""We have a very big advantage compared with the similar products from other countries. We could quickly upgrade products based on self-designed technologies and adapt to the needs of athletes,"" said Cao Lijun, vice dean of Innovation Technology Research Institute at FAW.

They will soon be sent for official approval from international sporting regulators.

Its raw power will be there for all to see at the test activities slated for the coming months leading up to the Games next February.

""FIFA can confirm that it has been informed today by the JFA that, due to the COVID-19 pandemic and hosting situation in the country, they are no longer in a position to host the FIFA Club World Cup 2021,"" it said in a statement.

""FIFA would like to thank the JFA for their work and commitment and looks forward to going back to Japan in the future. Further details about an alternative host for the FIFA Club World Cup 2021 will be announced by FIFA in due course.""

The Japanese government on Thursday decided to extend the COVID-19 state of emergency in many parts of the country as it looked to suppress a fresh wave of infections.

With the JFA relinquishing its right to host this event, Qatar is potentially taking over the job, according to The Telepraph.

Lionel Messi scored a hat-trick to overtake Pele as the top international goalscorer in South American football history on Thursday, as Argentina cruised to a 3-0 victory over Bolivia in their 2022 World Cup qualifier.

Messi pounced for his 77th, 78th and 79th international goals to keep Argentina firmly on course for a place at next year's finals in Qatar against a Bolivia team languishing near the foot of the table.

The 34-year-old Paris Saint-Germain forward, making his 153rd appearance for Argentina, drew level with Pele's longstanding mark of 77 goals in the 14th minute, nutmegging a defender and then curling a sublime shot past Bolivia goalkeeper Carlos Lampe.

The Argentina captain then moved one clear of Pele in the 64th minute with his second goal of the night, surging into the Bolivian box and playing a one-two with Lautaro Martinez before tucking away a finish from close range.

Messi completed the seventh international hat-trick of his career two minutes from time, burying a rebound from close range after a shot from the edge of the area was only parried by Lampe.

""Overall, I think I have got a very positive response,"" declared Arsene Wenger, FIFA's head of Global Football Development, when asked at a recent press briefing about the organization's extremely radical and highly controversial plans to stage the World Cup every two years.



The former Arsenal legend, one of the most successful managers in the history of the Premier League, is widely considered to have been the embodiment of wisdom and reason during his trophy-laden coaching career.



However, as the current public face of this biennial World Cup idea, the 71-year-old Frenchman has underestimated the loud and powerful opposition to change the status quo.

Arsene Wenger has led the project to stage the World Cup every two years despite European opposition. /CFP Arsene Wenger has led the project to stage the World Cup every two years despite European opposition. /CFP

The first shot was fired by UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin, who expressed straight from the shoulder his objection to the plan and even looked at the possibility of boycotting the showpiece event. ""We can decide not to play in it. As far as I know, the South Americans are on the same page. So good luck with a World Cup like that,"" Ceferin told The Times.



""I think it will never happen as it is so much against the basic principles of football. To play every summer a one-month tournament, for the players it's a killer. It might be good for UEFA financially but the problem is we would be killing football like that. We are killing the players. I don't see the clubs allowing the players to go and that would divide us completely,"" he added.



La Liga president Javier Tebas also voiced his opposition. ""A biennial World Cup is a threat not just to domestic football leagues but to the overall tradition of world football,"" he told Marca.



""It would require a reshuffle of the calendar that would disrupt the domestic leagues to the extent that interest would be lost and the continuity is jeopardized. This would have a cascading effect on the entire football pyramid, with fans losing interest in the sport. New competitions or playing more often will not help grow football, to the contrary.""

The stance was echoed by Sebastian Coe, World Athletics president and a member of the International Olympic Committee.



""I can see no good reason for it,"" he was quoted as saying by the Guardian. ""There may be vested interests here, but the summer sports are protective about the landscape as it's hard enough for them as it is to grab space in the traditional or digital media. A biennial World Cup will inevitably start clashing with the Olympic Games too.""



""I'm a big football fan, but I fear that you're going to put a lot of players under some big physical stress. The clubs and leagues are all opposed to it. And my gut instinct is that you can keep cramming stuff into the calendar if you really want to, but less is more sometimes,"" Coe concluded.

Prosecutor Stefanie Eckert told the court that Boateng's former partner Sherin Senler was a ""victim of domestic violence"" but also that Boateng was a ""victim of their mutually toxic relationship.""

The public prosecutor had been looking for a suspended jail sentence of one and a half years and a fine of 1.5 million euros.

It was the highest possible financial damages that could be imposed by the Munich District Court.

Former Germany and Bayern Munich footballer Jerome Boateng was found guilty of domestic violence against his former partner and ordered to pay her 1.8 million euros ($2.13 million) on Thursday.

The 33-year-old Boateng, who had denied the allegations of abuse, reacted calmly to the court's decision. He can appeal the ruling.

Boateng had earlier denied hitting and injuring Senler in July 2018 when they were on vacation in the Turks and Caicos Islands. He was charged with allegations of willful bodily harm and verbal abuse against Senler, the mother of their two children.

The indictment said Boateng beat her, boxed her, bit her head, threw her on the ground and insulted her. The prosecutors' office also accused Boateng of throwing a glass lantern and cooling bag at his partner.

Boateng told the court his former partner had become aggressive and insulting during a dispute after a game of cards. He said she hit him and injured his lip and that she fell when he tried to push her away. He disputed throwing a lantern at her, but said it fell when he threw a cushion at a table. Boateng said he had never hit his ex-girlfriend.

Senler later told the court that Boateng punched her in the kidney so hard that she found it difficult to breathe. She said he tore at her hair, bit her head, and pressed his thumb into her eye, giving her a black eye. She said that particular incident on July 19, 2018, was not the first of its kind, but the most violent.

She said the couple had an ""on-off relationship"" since 2007. ""Our relationship was always turbulent,"" Senler said."

801,What awaits Luka Doncic and Dallas Mavericks in new NBA season?,"Luka Doncic (R) of the Dallas Mavericks and the team's owner Mark Cuban attend the press conference on Doncic signing contract extension with the Mavericks in Ljubljana, Slovenia, August 10, 2021. /CFP Luka Doncic (R) of the Dallas Mavericks and the team's owner Mark Cuban attend the press conference on Doncic signing contract extension with the Mavericks in Ljubljana, Slovenia, August 10, 2021. /CFP

The Dallas Mavericks and their owner Mark Cuban were sincere enough flying to Slovenia to offer a five-year, $207-million contract extension to Luka Doncic. The 22-year-old genius signed on it, making sure that the Mavericks can retain him until 2027 summer. Having played three seasons in the NBA, Doncic averaged 25.7 points, 7.3 rebounds and 8.4 assists. His 3-point rate last season rose to 35 percent at which he could drain 2.9 triples per game. He has been considered for the regular season MVP for quite a while. Having led the Mavericks to the playoffs in the past two seasons, Doncic was even more dominant in the postseason as he dropped 35.7 points, 7.9 rebounds and 10.3 assists while making 4.4 shots from the 3-point line at 40.8 percent. Doncic had his playoff highlights as well after beating the buzzer against the Los Angeles Clippers. He is already a top playmaker in today's NBA.

However, the Mavericks have yet found proper help for Doncic. During this year's offseason, they extended Tim Hardaway Jr.'s deal by five years, $90 million; they signed free agents Reggie Bullock and Sterling Brown. They surely wanted to do more and tried to chase Chris Paul, Kyle Lowry, Mike Conley or Spencer Dinwiddie, only to find that none of them wanted to come to American Airlines Center. That means the Mavericks will start the new season with basically the same squad from last year. Unfortunately, that roster is not good enough to make any difference in the Western Conference with the following problems. Lack of the second playmaker Basketball grows more ""positionless"" in today's NBA and Doncic has been doing an orchestrator's job most of the time. But the Mavericks still need the second player able to launch offense either from outside via screen play or from inside by posting up around the paint. Jalen Brunson is a good player and works really hard, but he is not the material to make a starting point guard in a playoff team. Kristaps Porzingis was such a big disappointment in the series against the Clippers that he almost became toxic asset with his contract that has three years, $100 million left (player option in 2023).

Lack of a well-balanced final squad From the Golden State Warriors' ""Hampton Five"" in 2017 to the Clippers' death lineup last season, every NBA team that targets the throne must have their ultimate squad for the clutch time of the game. Two things are necessary for such squads: First, players must be able to defend multiple positions; second, they have to be able to stretch the floor. The Mavericks, unfortunately, don’t have any solution like this. Two years ago, they filled the roster with shooters but were too vulnerable defensively. One year ago, the team tried to pivot to toward defense by landing Josh Richardson and James Johnson but it did not work as they had expected.

802,Kyodo News: Japan won't host 2021 Club World Cup due to COVID-19,"The Emperor's Cup final may be brought forward from New Year's Day to December 19 since the Club World Cup won't happen around that date, according to Kyodo News. That should give the Japanese national team players more time to rest and prepare for the FIFA World Cup qualification tournament games on January 27 and February 1, 2022.

Kyodo News also revealed that FIFA has not decided which country will replace Japan as the host or when the tournament will happen. Traditionally, the Club World Cup takes place in December, but it might be postponed this time.

The Japan Football Association (JFA) is discussing relinquishing the right to host the 2021 Club World Cup with FIFA due to the COVID-19 situation in the country, according to Kyodo News.

The Club World Cup, which evolved from the Toyota Cup, used to combine both the European and South American champions in one game. Today, the event has clubs from six confederations. The JFA was counting on it to create decent revenues with full crowds of over 60,000 for the semifinals and final at International Stadium Yokohama.

However, that plan is not going anywhere because of the COVID-19 restrictions in place. Even if the games can happen – probably behind closed doors – there will be hardly any profit, if not losses.

The JFA's profit for the 2020 fiscal year was 15 billion yen (about $136 million), five billion yen less than in 2019. National team games had no spectators at all. As a result, Kozo Tashima, president of the Japanese football-governing body, said the JFA has to ""dip into their savings"" this fiscal year.

""Unless we forge a path to where events can be staged in coexistence with the virus, soccer as well as other sports won't be able to maintain themselves,"" said a senior JFA official."

Zhou Qi, starting center of the Chinese national basketball team, joined the South East Melbourne Phoenix of the National Basketball League (NBL) in Australia, confirmed both the team and the player himself on Wednesday. ""I'm glad to join the South East Melbourne Phoenix in the NBL. They are a promising team full of youthful spirit. I want to thank CEO and general manager Tommy Greer and the front office for their sincerity and approval. I'm looking forward to working with head coach Simon Mitchell and his staff. My gratitude also goes to the other teams that invited me to join,"" posted Zhou on Sina Weibo. ""We've signed 7'1 Chinese star and former Houston Rocket, Zhou Qi (@officialzhouqi) to a two-year contract!"" Tweeted the Phoenix.

Zhou signed a 1+1 contract with the team and can opt out of the deal in 2022. He will also be able to play for China in the FIBA Basketball World Cup qualifiers in late November. Zhou's teammate Liu Chuanxing already signed with the Brisbane Bullets earlier. The ""China Derby"" between the two will definitely draw a lot of attention. The NBL is the top basketball league in Australia. LaMelo Ball played for the Illawarra Hawks in the 2019-20 season and was named the NBL Rookie of the Year before getting drafted by the NBA's Charlotte Hornets with the third-overall pick in 2020. Ball then received the NBA Rookie of the Year Award after his debut season. Another promising young man who left the NBL for the NBA in recent years was Josh Giddey who played for the Adelaide 36ers and won the Rookie of the Year Award as well before being selected by the Oklahoma City Thunder with the sixth-overall pick on July 29.

Zhou was not a rookie like either of the above. He played two years in the NBA (and the NBA G-League) for the Houston Rockets (and the Rio Grande Valley Vipers) between 2017 and 2019. In his longer CBA career, Zhou was already a top 3 player in the Chinese league after winning one championship and three CBA Vest Defender trophies as the franchise player of the Xinjiang Flying Tigers. Zhou rejected contract extension offer from the Flying Tigers this summer. But according to CBA rules, he can't join any other CBA team unless the Flying Tigers agree to let him go. He withdrew from the 2021-22 CBA season in late August.

Yuya Osako's first-half goal helped Japan beat China 1-0 in the final round of the FIFA World Cup Asian Zone qualifiers on Tuesday.

China came into the game after a 3-0 defeat to Australia, while Japan were stunned by Oman 1-0 in their opener of the final qualifying round. Both teams were eager to get their qualification campaign back on track.

Facing Japan, the highest FIFA ranked team in Asia, Chinese head coach Li Tie fielded five defenders in the starting line-up. But they suffered an early setback as veteran center back Zhang Linpeng had to be stretched off just five minutes into the match due to a waist injury and was replaced by Zhu Chenjie.

""Zhang was injured by accident. His injury seems very severe and he will go through PCR test tomorrow,"" Li said in the post-match press conference. ""We had a preliminary plan when Zhang couldn't play, the young defender Zhu played a very good match and executed our tactics well.""

Japan had 78 percent ball possession and 14 shots in the first half. Forward Kubo Takefusa penetrated into the penalty area in the 22nd minute, but his close-range shot was denied by the post. They broke the deadlock in the 40th minute, when Junya Ito raced down the right flank and found Osako who tapped in from inside the box to put his side 1-0 ahead.

In the second half, China managed to keep Japan at bay but was unable to level the score despite sending strikers A Lan and Luo Guofu on in a bid to strengthen their counterattack.

""I am very grateful for the efforts of my players. We saw the gap between us and the best team in Asia through the game. I am satisfied with the fighting spirits of my players,"" Li said. ""All my players have equal opportunities, I only select the starting lineup on the basis of the game plan and requirements. No matter starters or substitutes, they all fought hard.""

The Chinese were drawn into Group B of the final round with Australia, Japan, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Vietnam. The top two will qualify for Qatar 2022 directly. The third finisher will play a home-and-away playoff with its counterpart in Group A, and the winner will go into a continental playoff.

Elsewhere on Tuesday, Australia beat Vietnam 1-0 to top the group, while Saudi Arabia also claimed a 1-0 victory against Oman.

China will next play Vietnam on October 7 in Sharjah, the United Arab Emirates. The Chinese sqaud will depart for Sharjah on Wednesday.

""We will definitely train very hard and I hope all my players' fitness could improve to a higher level after one month of training,"" Li said.

""I hope we have chances to play friendly matches against teams who are better than us. Before the final round of the qualifying tournament, We couldn't play high-quality games for nearly two years due to the pandemic. Australia and Japan out-competed us with a fast tempo, that's what we need to improve on,"" he added."

TOP HEADLINES

• All barriers to the World Health Organization clearing Russia's Sputnik V COVID-19 vaccine have now been cleared and only some paperwork remains to be completed, says Russian health minister Mikhail Murashko.

Sputnik V, widely used in Russia and approved in more than 70 countries, has been under review by the WHO for months but has yet to be cleared to join the list of COVID-19 vaccines so far given WHO emergency use approval - Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Sinovac, Sinopharm, Moderna and J&J.

""Russia's position on promotion and registration of the Sputnik V vaccine was heard, we have removed all the questions for today,"" Murashko was quoted as saying by Interfax news agency after a meeting with WHO director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus in Geneva.

He said that the company which is dealing with Sputnik V registration at WHO only ""has to sign a few documents, submit a few additional papers."" Reuters said the WHO could not be immediately reached for comment.

• The death toll from a fire in an intensive care unit at a Romanian hospital treating COVID-19 patients, the third in one of the country's hospitals in a year, has reached a total of nine victims.

• Meanwhile, thousands of people gathered in Bucharest to complain against Romania's ""mandatory vaccination,"" despite cases rising in the country at an alarming rate. Romania has vaccinated a third of its population of 19 million, but it's still the EU country with the second lowest vaccination rate after Bulgaria.

• Number two ranked tennis player Aryna Sabalenka will not play at the Indian Wells tournament in the U.S. after testing positive for COVID-19. The 23-year-old, the top seed in the women's draw, said: ""I've started my isolation and I'll be staying here until I'm cleared by the doctors and health officials. So far I'm looking ok but really sad to not be able to play this year.""

• Russia reported a new high of 890 COVID-19-related deaths in one day on Sunday, the fifth successive daily record. The government coronavirus task force also said it had recorded 25,769 new cases in the last 24 hours, including 4,294 in Moscow.

• The UK is expected to cut its travel restriction, slashing its ""red list"" from 54 to only nine, according to a report in The Sunday Telegraph. Many travelers to and from these countries who have been fully vaccinated will be able to avoid costly hotel quarantines as soon as later next week.

• New Zealand has announced tighter border restrictions, as new cases emerge in areas previously considered COVID-19-free. Travelers arriving by plane aged 17 and above will need to be fully vaccinated to be allowed entry to the country, unless they're New Zealand citizens.

• Beijing will resume its city-wide annual marathon on October 31 after having it cancelled last year because of the pandemic, according to Xinhua. The race is expected to involve about 30,000 runners."

Bernard Tapie, pictured here in 2018, was one of France's best known personalities. /AFP

French tycoon Bernard Tapie, whose career spanned business, sports, politics and the arts - and included scandal and prison - has died at the age of 78.

Tapie revealed in 2017 that he had cancer of the stomach and esophagus, with his family announcing his death on Sunday.

""He left peacefully, surrounded by his wife, his children and grandchildren, who were at his bedside,"" a family statement said, adding that he wished to be buried in Marseille, ""the city of his heart.""

Condolences poured in after the news of his death, led by the current French President Emmanuel Macron who hailed his ""ambition, energy and enthusiasm that were a source of inspiration for generations of French people.""

""This man, who had a combativeness that could move mountains and take down the moon, never gave up,"" his office said in a statement.

Born in Paris, a young Tapie began his working life selling televisions by day, taking over failing companies and amassing 50 by the time he was 30.

He flaunted his wealth, buying a large property in Paris and a string of mansions on the French Riviera as well as a 72-meter yacht.

Tapie also used his fortune to buy a cycling team which twice won the Tour de France and in 1986 he purchased one of France's biggest football clubs, Olympique de Marseille, guiding them to five successive league triumphs and the 1993 Champions League title."
1034,Eight killed after plane crashes into empty building in Milan,"Eight people have died after a private plane they were traveling on crashed into an empty building on the outskirts of Milan in northern Italy, police said.

The crash happened near a suburban metro station when the plane collided with the two-storey building, which was being renovated.

""I heard the sound of an aeroplane above me, as if the plane was shutting down its engine,"" one resident told Reuters.

""Then I heard a very loud explosion, the windows of our house started to shake so I opened the window and saw a huge cloud of smoke rising into the sky,"" he added.

Several vehicles parked along the street caught fire after the crash, witnesses said. No other casualties were reported."
1035,The loggerhead turtles breaking records because of climate change,"On a beach near Venice, Italy, a group of researchers watched 26 loggerhead turtles crawl out of their nest and make their way to the sea.

While the turtles are endangered, this would not have grabbed international attention if it wasn't for the location of the turtle's nest.

Guido Pietroluongo, a vet who was responsible for the management of the turtle nest, said it is the most northerly recorded nest for turtles ever recorded.

Usually, the turtles are born in the southern Mediterranean where it is warmer. Now their recent movement north is believed to have been caused by climate change, environmental protection policies and rising sea temperatures.

Another nest was also discovered at the park of the Po Delta, which is in Northern Italy.

In that case, the researchers found the nest only after many of the turtles hatched, and only one newborn was known to have made it to the sea."

Georgian Dream said in a statement that the closely-watched elections ""were held at the highest democratic standards.""

1037,London orchestra moves into a school to cut costs and share expertise,"COVID-19 restrictions have been tough for musicians whose livelihoods suffered as theaters, concert halls and other venues remained closed during lockdown. One London orchestra has risen to the challenge and cut its costs by moving into a state secondary school where it practices and works on music and other projects with pupils. The Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment, the OAE, is one of the UK's leading period instrument ensembles. It used to be based at the prestigious Kings Place concert venue. But last year, during the pandemic, it moved its residency into the Acland Burghley Comprehensive School in North London.

02:58

The OAE has taken over a former classroom for its office. Part of the attraction was the assembly hall which has excellent acoustics - between the twice-daily school assemblies the orchestra uses the hall for rehearsals. Some musicians may have been nervous about the move, but viola player Marina Ascherson now sees the benefits of being based in a school. ""I think there's a real input of energy from the students here and that feeds into our rehearsing and our music-making when we are here particularly,"" she said during a break in rehearsals, adding that she thought their music had actually improved by being in the school. Some students, like 15-year-old Michael Cheetham, were also skeptical at the beginning. ""At first I was a bit confused about why there was an orchestra at a secondary school. But having an orchestra on base that can provide support, physically, by playing music for us or financially by providing equipment for us to perform or show off our talents at Burghley has been a really, really nice thing to have.""

A first in Britain The only other known example of a similar project was in Germany, where an orchestra there moved into a school in a deprived area of Bremen in 2015. The results were described as transformational for both the musicians and the students. The OAE's chief executive, Crispin Woodhead sees the orchestra's move as a win-win for both the school and the musicians. ""What we want people to see is that if you are an orchestra that had that prestigious building of glass and steel, if you move to a north London comprehensive school it's better for you financially, you have more fun, you get to do brilliant projects with musicians, you get to meet lots of exciting young people. So, its win, win, win and it's better for the school,"" Woodhead said. The move also provides an extra income for the school and headteacher Nicholas John believes it has also helped boost creativity. ""There's so much in it for the school. It has already brought a huge electric pulse through our work. They are working in workshops with all our children, there is universal entitlement. We are seeing their influence all the way through the curriculum,"" John explained."
1038,The Irish firefighting goats that were thought to be extinct,"The ancient breed of Old Irish Goat was feared to be extinct until some were found scattered in the western mountains of Mulranney, with DNA testing confirming their identity.

But now conservationists are hoping to boost their recovery, while also protecting Dublin's suburb of Howth from gorse fires.

A herd of 25 of the short, stocky and bearded goats are grazing on the gorse, under the watchful eyes of herder Melissa Jeuken.

""Howth was targeted by a lot of fire. So there's a lot of gorse here and it's very flammable,"" she explained.

""The goats on the other hand love gorse, so it's a win-win in that sense. They're a hard-working crew, they're up for the job, they're keen to do it.""

The project aims to instill ""key conservation grazing principles to tackle fire prevention and habitat management,"" while helping to ensure the breed's survival, she said.

Firefighters were deployed to deal with a number of gorse fires in the area this summer.

There had been around 250,000 of the breed in the early 1900s. It was thought to have been introduced to Ireland about 5,000 years ago."
1039,A pollution-sniffing plane is monitoring Belgium's coastal waters,"Off the coast of Belgium, a plane fitted with an atmospheric pollution sensor 'sniffs' out pollution from passing ships.

Every hour, the plane, which has been dubbed the ""sniffer,"" monitors the sulfur and nitrogen levels from between 10 to 15 ships to check if they exceed European regulations.

It is a large jump from the one-ship-a-day Belgium port inspectors were able to check before the coastguard started to use this device.

If the ship does breach the rules, the company running it could face a $350,000 fine if the findings are confirmed by further testing.

The 65-kilometer stretch of the Belgian coast is one of the busiest in the world. And every day, around 400 ships travel along it.

The plane's ability to check many of these ships is important because ""globally, there are about 800,000 people who die per year because of pollution from ships,"" said Ward Van Roy, one of the aerial operators.

""That's a lot. About 15 percent of all sulfur and nitrogen pollution comes from shipping."""

1048,Notes on a Pandemic: Science Rules,"16:44

Since the first case of COVID-19 was reported in the Chinese city of Wuhan late last year, the focus of the world's medical community has been on finding an effective treatment in the fastest possible time.

Leaders in pharmaceutical research, working at breakneck speed, have predicted that a vaccine prototype may be ready in September.

Half a year on, however, a more cautionary tone is emerging.

""This virus may never go away"" warned Michael Ryan, of the World Health Organization, in May.

""It may become just another endemic virus in our communities. HIV has not gone away… and I am not comparing the two diseases, but I think it is important that we be realistic.""

The challenge

Producing a vaccine for COVID-19 is not the only issue facing the international pharmaceutical industry.

""It's a huge challenge to manufacture sufficient vaccines to be able to protect the world's population,"" Jonathan Ball, professor of molecular virology at the University of Nottingham, told CGTN Europe.

""It's also a challenge for logistics in how fast and how rapidly can you develop and manufacture the vaccines as well as distribute them.""

Pressure

Despite calls for collaboration in the hunt for an effective and affordable treatment, problems are emerging.

The race for a vaccine has left the pharmaceutical sector under pressure as never before, from both public and private health providers and from politicians, who are moving fast to secure supplies for their own populations.

""I think what we see is that ... everybody wants to see that their own citizens are protected,"" Thomas Cueni, the director general of the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers in Geneva, told CGTN Europe.

""But … the reason I am optimistic is the European Commission was leading the global solidarity call, together with philanthropic organizations … and therefore notwithstanding that we do have a strong signal of nationalism, we at the same time have the combination with this call for solidarity.""

1051,Calls for more action to combat climate change at pre-COP26 summit,"On the final day of climate talks in Italy the COP26 president said there was a consensus to do more to reach the target of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius as outlined in the Paris Agreement.

Speaking on Saturday afternoon in Milan, Alok Sharma also said the world's leading economies would deliver on their promise to deliver $100 billion a year to poorer countries struggling to deal with climate change.

In the past week, Italy's financial capital transformed into a hub of debate ahead of the United Nations' official COP26 Summit Glasgow next month.

The vice president of the European Commission, Frans Timmerman, gave a stark warning of the depth of the climate crisis.

""There can be no doubt in anybody's mind that we are fighting for the survival of humanity, and that the climate crisis and the threatening ecocide are the biggest threat humanity faces,"" he said.

It's a serious sentiment shared by U.S. delegate John Kerry, who says the next decade will be crucial for a 45 percent reduction in emissions.

""The United States is on its way with a plan to have our entire power sector be carbon-free by 2035. We are all in this together, and there's no way for any small country to resolve this problem and there's no way for any large country individually to solve the problem alone,"" Kerry said.

Thousands of climate activists from around the world took part in the event. Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg made headlines after criticizing leaders for what she said were empty promises.

""Net zero, blah, blah, blah. Climate neutral, blah, blah, blah. This is all we hear from our so-called leaders - words, words that sound great but so far, has led to no action.""

Her words resonate with a generation demanding action, and fellow protesters filled Milan's streets on Friday to have their message heard.

They also met with Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi, who says they have every right to be angry.

""Your generation will feel the worst effects of climate change. We want a commitment from G20 countries to keep the agreement to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius within reach,"" said Draghi.

The crucial climate talks come after Europe's hottest summer on record and several extreme weather events like wildfires and floods. The United Nations chief Antonio Guterres says the world is nearing the point of no return.

With time running out, hopes are now riding on the summit in Glasgow."

1053,Georgia goes to polls a day after arrest of ex-president Saakashvili,"02:54

Georgians have been voting in a local election - a day after the country's former president was arrested after secretly returning from exile in the Ukraine. Early Friday, before his arrest, Mikheil Saakashvili posted a video on Facebook of himself speaking from the Georgian Black Sea port of Batumi. In it, he urges supporters to take to the street of the capital Tbilisi ahead of Sunday's election result. ""I ask you, be active. I'm with you not only morally, but I'm also physically here, in Batumi, Kutaisi, Tbilisi. I will join you in Tbilisi on October 3 and 2. I count on you,"" Saakashvili said.

Just hours later, he was arrested in the city of Rustavi, south of the capital. Saakashvili swept to power in presidential elections in 2004, ousting the Moscow-backed incumbent Eduard Shevardnadze. He went on to rule the country until 2013, but his government was marred by accusations of authoritarianism and human rights abuses. Removed from office in a corruption probe, which he claims was politically motivated, he was stripped of his citizenship and fled to the Ukraine. He was later sentenced to six years in prison if he tried to return.

After his arrest, current president Salome Zourabichvili said that she would not pardon her predecessor, and said he intended to destabilize the country by returning. Saakashvili is currently planning a hunger strike while in jail, according to his lawyers. While he remains a divisive figure, Saakashvili's United National Movement (UNM) still commands a loyal following in Georgia. The municipal elections have taken on extra significance amid a months-long political crisis. ""If Georgian Dream doesn't get what it got in the previous parliamentary elections, which was 48.22 percent, we might have some turmoil again, probably another wave of political crisis,"" Soso Dzamukashvili, a junior researcher at Emerging Europe, told Reuters."
1054,Watch: Drone footage shows La Palma volcano's destructive lava trail,"As La Palma's volcano continues to spew red-hot lava and thick clouds of black smoke, a drone has captured its devastating trail of lava across the island.

Authorities have advised people to limit their time outdoors in parts of La Palma, but have lifted a stay-home order in places near the volcano that had been hit by poor air quality.

""In response to the improvement in air quality measurements in the area, the lockdown in Tazacorte, El Paso and Los Llanos de Aridane will be lifted,"" the services said in a statement.

They said people should continue to avoid spending a ""prolonged amount of time"" outside, adding that vulnerable groups including children and the elderly should stay indoors.

The Cumbre Vieja volcano erupted on September 19 and has destroyed more than 800 buildings.

About 6,000 people have been evacuated from their homes on the island, part of Spain's Canary Islands archipelago in the Atlantic.

On Friday, lava flowed from a new vent in the volcano, which the Canaries Volcanology Institute described as a new ""focus of eruption.""

The volcano was experiencing ""intense activity,"" said Miguel Angel Morcuende, director of the Pevolca response committee, but stressed that less than 8 percent of the island had been affected.

""The rest is leading a normal life,"" he said."

Serbians removed a blockade of trucks and cars at the border with Kosovo on Saturday as NATO troops took control of the area under an EU-mediated deal, ending a tense stand-off between the two administrations over car license plates. Kosovo special police were also expected to withdraw from the border area nearly two weeks after Serbians first blocked the roads, a reaction to Pristina's introduction of a new rule requiring Serbian license plates to be removed or hidden from cars entering Kosovo.

The two sides agreed in EU-mediated talks to allow free traffic back in 2014. However, Kosovo officials said the deal had expired and from September 20, started to enforce the rule that only Kosovo-issued license plates were now valid in the territory.

Those with Serbian plates would instead have to use non-permanent printed 60-day registration details.

Kosovo officials said the decision was a direct response to Serbian measures taken against drivers from Kosovo since 2008, when it declared independence from Serbia.

Serbia does not recognize Kosovo's independence, nor its authority to take certain state actions, such as registering cars. Therefore, its police have for years been taking off registration plates from Kosovo-registered cars entering Serbia."

Ex-French President Nicolas Sarkozy has played down his conviction for illegal campaign financing, making his first public comments on the conviction - his second this year - during a book signing event in Paris.

Sarkozy was sentenced on Thursday to a one-year prison term for unlawful overspending during his failed 2012 re-election bid.

However, the court decision did not stop the conservative politician appearing at a Paris bookshop to sign copies of his new book ""Promenades.""

As hundreds of people gathered at the Lamartine bookshop to greet the former leader, Sarkozy said the support was ""very moving and very reassuring, regarding the state of the country's morale.""

""People aren't fooled,"" he added.

Seven people have died after a fire broke out in a Romanian intensive care unit for treating COVID-19 patients, the country's third deadly hospital fire under a year.

Patients were forced to jump out of windows from the hospital's lower levels in the coastal city of Constanta as firefighters carried people out.

The country's emergency response unit first announced nine people had died, but Transport Minister Lucian Bode later said there had been a miscommunication between hospital staff and the firefighters.

The blaze was extinguished at around 07:55 GMT, with emergency services having been brought in from nearby counties."

TOP HEADLINES

• Seven people died on Friday after a fire broke out in a Romanian intensive care unit treating COVID-19 patients, the country's third deadly hospital fire in a year. Prosecutors have opened an investigation into the cause while angry relatives of patients protested outside the building.

• Deaths related to COVID-19 hit 5 million on Friday, according to the Reuters news agency. While it took just over a year for the COVID-19 death toll to hit 2.5 million, the next 2.5 million deaths were recorded in just under eight months, according to the agency's analysis.

• The EU's drug regulator has identified a potential link between the Johnson & Johnson vaccine and rare cases of blood clotting, recommending the condition be listed as a possible side-effect of the shot.

• Russia has reported 887 deaths, its largest single-day death toll since the pandemic began and the fourth daily record in a row.

• In France, the seven-day average of new cases has dropped below 5,000 for the first time since July 13. Earlier in the year, new daily cases had fallen below 2,000, but the infection rate had hit nearly 24,000 by mid-August.

• Swiss citizens who convince their friends to get a vaccine are being offered a free restaurant meal or cinema outing by the government, under a scheme aimed at boosting the country's comparatively low vaccination rate.

• The Delta variant increases risks for unvaccinated pregnant women compared with coronavirus cases earlier in the pandemic, new data suggest. Until early 2021, the proportion of severe or critical cases among pregnant women was around 5 percent, and were ""largely nonexistent"" in February and most of March 2021, researchers in Dallas, U.S. said. They add that the study ""highlight the urgency of the requirement of prevention measures including COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy.""

• Six months after a second dose of Pfizer, many recipients no longer have vaccine-induced antibodies that help protect against infection, a new study suggests. The shot induced high levels of antibodies when initially given, the researchers said, but these levels dropped by nearly 10-fold after seven months. However neutralizing antibodies are not the immune system's only defense against the virus and real-world studies in the UK recently showed that after 20 weeks, protection against hospitalization (or death) remains above 90 percent for Pfizer recipients.

• UK nationals visiting India will from Monday have to quarantine even if they are fully vaccinated, in what is being seen as a direct response to new UK curbs on Indian citizens. The new rules follow the UK decision to require Indians vaccinated with AstraZeneca's Covishield - identical to the doses given to millions of Britons - to quarantine.

• An experimental antiviral pill could halve the chances of being hospitalized for those most at risk of getting severe COVID-19, according to new data. Hailed as a ""huge advance"" in how the virus is treated, Molnupiravir, produced by U.S. drugmakers Merck, would be the first oral antiviral medication for the coronavirus if it is approved. The chair of Britain's antivirals taskforce has hinted at the UK's interest in buying the potential breakthrough pill.

• School-age children are leading an increase in infections in England, according to data from Britain's Office for National Statistics. Following schools being open for around a month, more than 1 in 25 students tested positive for the coronavirus, with the overall prevalence figure for England at 1 in 85.

• Cases of rare heart inflammation were relatively higher for those having taken Moderna's vaccine compared with the Pfizer/BioNTech shot, according to new research from the Public Health Agency of Canada. The data also showed heart inflammation occurred more often in males, and in adolescents and adults under the age of 30. But as with previous studies elsewhere, incidents remain very rare.

Grand Duke George Mikhailovich Romanov wed Victoria Romanovna Bettarini, an Italian, at St Isaac's Cathedral in Russia's former imperial capital St Petersburg.

Russian Orthodox clergy conducted the elaborate ceremony, watched by hundreds of guests who included the groom's mother, Grand Duchess Maria Vladimirovna of Russia – the self-proclaimed heir to Russia's imperial throne – and more than a dozen minor European royals.

Does Ireland face supply chain chaos?

Mikhailovich's great-grandfather, Grand Duke Kirill Vladimirovich, fled Russia during the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution, escaping first to Finland and later relocating with his family to Western Europe.

Russia's last tsar, Nicholas II, his wife and five children were killed by a firing squad in July, 1918, in the cellar of a merchant's house in Yekaterinburg, a city 1,450km east of Moscow.

Mikhailovich, 40, was born in Madrid and has lived most of his life in Spain and France.

Bettarini, 39, who converted to the Russian Orthodox faith last year and took the name Victoria Romanovna, was led to the altar by her father, Roberto Bettarini, who has served in the Italian diplomatic service.

Mikhailovich visited Russia for the first time in 1992 and moved to Moscow in 2019, where he works on several charity projects.

The Romanov dynasty ruled Russia for more than 300 years before Nicholas II's abdication.

Russia's Orthodox Church in 2000 canonized Nicholas II, who had been portrayed as a weak leader by Soviet authorities.

1060,La Palma volcano chaos: Still no end in sight,"The eruptions began almost two weeks ago and have shown no signs of slowing down, Cumbre Vieja has left a devastating trail.

So far, more than 600 buildings have been destroyed and more than 6,000 people have had to evacuate. Thankfully, no lives have been lost.

Toxic threat

The lava reached the sea earlier in the week, which has caused a chemical reaction with the cold water to produce toxic gases and particles that have been released into the atmosphere.

Fire Fighters have been concerned about the air quality, as potentially dangerous levels of both chlorine and sulphur are now being registered.

Ruben Fernandez is the Technical Director of Volcano Risk Prevention Plan (Pevolca), he says it's almost certain the authorities will have to impose a lockdown for residents similar to the one brought in during the pandemic

""We're likely to impose measures to restrict people's movement outdoors. This is aimed at protecting the population. The smell of sulphur, the smell of rotten eggs, will probably be more intense throughout the valley and its surroundings.""

Eruption could last weeks... or months

Estimates vary on how long this eruption will last. Scientists believe it could range anywhere from three weeks to three months. The last time La Palma witnessed volcanic activity was 50 years ago and that was a short eruption. The residents will be hoping history repeats itself.

The Spanish government has pledged emergency help for those who have lost everything. They have offered $12 million to the island, about half of which will go towards rebuilding houses for those left homeless. But that figure would likely have to increase if the eruptions spread.

Rosa Maria Mateos from the Geological and Mining Institute of Spain told CGTN that Cumbre Vieja's destructive threat was far from over.

""This volcano has been hard to predict. Right now, there is a new fissure opening on the north side. So we may see lava flowing in a different direction. That would be a very bad turn of events, lava would then spread to new areas, causing more destruction.""

The unpredictable nature of the Cumbre Vieja eruption has had a devastating impact on the lives of its residents. The physical, economic and psychological damage could be felt for years to come."

""I will meet with my EU counterpart Valdis Dombrovskis next week to discuss the 12th negotiating round, which will now take place in November rather than October,"" he said.

Australia's minister for trade, Dan Tehan, announced that the talks have been moved from October 12 to November but refused to comment on the reason for the postponement, according to Reuters.

Long-planned free trade talks between the EU and Australia have been postponed, as tensions continue between Canberra and France.

Australia angered France and the rest of the EU last month after Canberra cancelled a $40 billion deal for French submarines in favor of U.S. technology.

France then withdrew its ambassadors from both countries.

Tensions between the U.S. and France have since eased after president Joe Biden called his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron to say that the U.S. could have communicated better with Paris.

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is also planning to visit France next week to ""further strengthening the vital US-France relationship.""

France's U.S. ambassador has since returned to Washington, but its ambassador to Canberra has not done the same.

Paris has also publicly said that it no longer trusts Australia and that its officials lied about the deal.

Hiowever, in a statement to AFP, Tehan downplayed the row: ""We understand the French reaction to our submarine decision, but ultimately any nation must act in its national interest -- which is what Australia has done.""

He added that he will meet his EU counterpart next week and that ""we will continue preparing for the 12th round of negotiations and working towards concluding a free trade agreement that is in the interests of both Australia and the EU.""

Miriam Garcia Ferrer, an EU spokeswoman, also said that the talks between the two parties are not over.

She added that trade negotiations ""are always about substance over speed, and there are many open issues to negotiate. A one-month delay will also allow us to better prepare."""
1062,Arrests made following attacks on Chinese students in the UK,"He was bruised, bloodied and had a broken nose. And yet, moments after 25-year-old Cambridge University graduate Yuanzhao Zhang had allegedly been viciously beaten by a gang inside his local supermarket, he still found it in him to get back up and try to chase them.

Zhang agrees to meet back at the scene on Mill Road in the city where he explains his version of events in detail.

""I didn't notice them at first,"" he says. Then, one of them approached and began to attack. ""I turned around and there was this group of teenagers – some of them might be adults already. And they were staring at me. So I shouted at them 'what are you doing?' And then they shouted back with racial slurs. And that's when I knew it was a racially motivated attack.""

Zhang says he tried to fight back but that he was far outnumbered. He walks back down the road where he says the gang fled with him in pursuit. Despite help from a passing van driver who joined him in the chase, he says they dispersed and all escaped.

Several days later though, as Zhang recovers from surgery, three teenagers have now been arrested in connection with what police describe as a racially aggravated crime.

""The arrests follow incidents that took place between August and September in the city including a racial assault causing grievous bodily harm,"" Cambridge Constabulary confirmed in a written statement. ""We believe these incidents to be isolated to a specific group of people,"" it went on to say.

It is not yet clear whether all suspects have yet been detained. Zhang describes a group of at least 10 surrounding him.

The nearby community has rallied behind Zhang. The head of the trade association for this part of Cambridge is Piero D'Angelico who runs Piero's hairdressers, one of several businesses operating along the bustling Mill Road. ""We are very proud to live here,"" says D'Angelico, who speaks of the multicultural nature of this part of the city. ""We are very protective of each other,"" he says.

Cambridge is known around the world for its university and beautiful architecture. It is, by all accounts, a peaceful city. So these incidents have caused shock in the Chinese community particularly, as well as a storm on social media in both the UK and in China.

Further fuelling outrage, for a time at least, was news of a second string of alleged attacks on Chinese students in Sheffield. Indeed, such was the level of concern that the Chinese Embassy in the UK released a statement urging ""the British side … to bring criminals to justice."" It also called on Chinese residents in the UK to ""strengthen their safety precautions in the near future"" and ""be vigilant when going out.""

Since then, a 33-year-old woman named Shan He has been arrested and charged in connection with some of the incidents in Sheffield. There is no indication yet of a possible motive and no suggestion of a link between the Cambridge and Sheffield incidents.

Still, more generally such events contribute to a sense of worry. ""Since COVID-19,"" says Zuo Zongyou, who is president of the Chinese Students and Scholars Association in Sheffield, ""there are more hate crimes happening in the UK.""

The University of Sheffield has sent out reassurances on its official Twitter account, first offering support for the students affected and on Friday adding that ""it's our top priority to keep our students and staff as safe as possible."""
1063,"Pigs being culled and 150,000 face early death amid UK butcher crisis","Because of this, meat processors have suffered a 25 percent drop in their capacity, meaning thousands of excess pigs are being left on farms and are taking up space, creating welfare issues.

An estimated 150,000 pigs are at risk of being culled within weeks because Brexit and COVID-19 lockdowns have created a shortage of butchers and slaughterers in the UK.

Thousands of healthy pigs are on the brink of being culled early in the UK and some may have already met their early death because of a lack of workers, according to the country's National Pig Association (NPA).

""There are about 120,000 pigs sat 'on-farm' currently that should have already been slaughtered, butchered, be within the food chain and eaten by now,"" said Lizzie Wilson, a policy services officer at the NPA.

""It is getting to the point where we are saying to the government, 'if we don't get some help soon, we're going to have to look at culling pigs on farms,' because that's our only option now.

""There are some producers that have already had the conversation.""

Another spokesperson for the NPA also told CGTN Europe they believed some farms were already making this decision and ""quietly"" culling some of their pigs. But they could not confirm how many farmers have done so or how many pigs they have culled.

The president of the National Farmers' Union, Minette Batters, estimated that farmers were ""potentially a week, 10 days away"" from culling 150,000 pigs.

Other UK industries are facing similar problems and last weekend, the government announced a plan to allow foreign truck drivers to obtain temporary visas.

Many people in the pork industry are calling for the government to do the same for foreign butchers. The British Meat Processors Association, quoted in The Times, said that the industry as a whole was short 15,000 workers.

Factories are also raising wages by 15 percent to attract necessary people, according to the NPA."

Does Ireland face supply chain chaos?

The man, identified as Francois Verove, committed suicide in a rented apartment, leaving a written confession, a source close to the case told AFP.

In the most notorious case, he was suspected of raping and murdering an 11-year-old girl named Cecile, who was found dead in the basement of the building where she lived in the 19th arrondissement of Paris.

He is also believed to have strangled a couple to death in the central Marais district of the capital in 1987.

A gendarme

Over the years, investigators came to believe the suspect may have been part of the Gendarmerie – armed forces in charge of internal security – at the time of the crimes and established a DNA profile of him.

In recent months, an investigating magistrate had begun questioning around 750 gendarmes who had been deployed in the Paris region at the time.

One of them was Verove, a 59-year-old man living in the south of France, who was sent a summons on September 24 but then was reported missing by his wife three days later.

He was found dead on Wednesday in Grau-du-Roi, a fishing village on the Mediterranean coast, a prosecutor's statement said.

He was a former gendarme, who later became a police officer and then retired, it said.

DNA proof

Police took a DNA sample from the body and found that it matched the genetic profile found at several of the crime scenes.

According to local media, Verove mentioned ""past impulses"" in a letter he left behind, which he had since brought ""under control"" and said he had committed no crimes after 1997. The murder confession contained no specifics, they said.

In 1986, police had published a police sketch based on witness statements that showed a man of around 25 years old, six feet tall with light-brown hair, and with visible traces of acne on his face.

A lawyer for Cecile's family, Didier Seban, thanked police for their work but also told AFP it was ""painful to know that the criminal took his secrets with him.""

According to the Parisien newspaper, Verove is also the suspect in another murder near Paris, of 19-year-old Karine Leroy, in 1994 in the city of Meaux.

A 'pleasant' man

In Prades-le-Lez, a large village north of Montpellier, Francois Verove has been remembered as a ""pleasant"" and ""rather sympathetic"" man, involved in local political life. And yet he was ""Le Grele,"" a wanted serial rapist and killer since the 1980s.

""If you had asked me the question two or three days ago, I would have answered you that I kept an extremely positive image: someone cordial, serious, who kept his commitments,"" the former mayor of the village, Jean-Marc Lussert, told AFP. He added the ex-gendarme as a running mate in the municipal elections of 2014.

Verove, who had also belonged to the police until a motorcycle accident on duty, was not elected. But he finally joined the city council in 2019, until the end of the legislature in 2020, after the resignation of several councilors.

He then moved to La Grande-Motte, a seaside resort near Montpellier and had not been a candidate for the last municipal elections.

He ""represented the Republican right,"" said Lussert, noting his ""total surprise"" and his ""incomprehension"" after the revelations about his former running mate. Adding: ""He was a bit fussy, he insisted on respecting the rules; parking for example. He applied them himself and that seemed logical to me for a former gendarme,"" he added.

The news quickly spread throughout the community he once represented on Friday.

""It's scary to know that he was there. And besides that he was active at the town hall,"" say Veronique and Sylvie, two childminders approached while they were walking young children in the town.

Verove ""did not give off the image of someone nasty."" He ""was rather nice,"" remembers Patrick Idelman, who had rubbed shoulders with him while he was covering local politics for the daily Midi Libre. ""He was an interesting person, who had ideas on municipal information, on social networks,"" added the former correspondent.

The world's longest submarine power cable, which runs from Norway to the UK, entered service on Friday, providing an additional lifeline to Britain's energy supply amid soaring gas prices.

The underwater electrical cable, called the North Sea Link (NSL), cost $1.9bn, stretches 720km and will begin transferring a maximum capacity of 700 megawatts (MW), gradually increasing to 1,400 MW over three months.

""At full capacity, North Sea Link will be able to supply 1.4 million homes with electricity,"" according to National Grid, which manages the British electricity grid and is a 50 percent shareholder in the NSL with Stattnet, its Norwegian counterpart.

Wind power for hydro power

The UK will be able to supply wind power to Norway when it produces a surplus and the Scandinavian country will be able to send its excess hydropower to the UK. The deal should help alleviate the pressures caused by peaks in demand and prices.

The NSL is seen as a major component in the UK's goal to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. National Grid said the link would help avoid 23 million tons of carbon emissions by 2030.

Already connected to France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Ireland, the UK is planning further interconnectors with the continent. A new submarine cable connecting it to Denmark, the Viking Link (765km, 621km underwater) is due to be completed at the end of 2023."

What is France proposing?

The price of gas in the country goes up by 12.6 percent on October 1. But the prime minister says the government will block further price hikes until at least April 2022. Jean Castex also said he wants to limit any electricity price rise to 4 percent.

The French government is going to make a one-off payment of $115 to the 6 million households that receive vouchers to help with the cost of rising energy bills.

What else did the prime minister say?

""For natural gas and electricity, we'll put in place what I would call a 'tariffs shield,'"" said Jean Castex. ""We're going to shield ourselves against those tariff hikes.""



What is going on with global gas prices?

Natural gas prices are at seven-year highs in the U.S. and record highs in Europe and Asia.

Gas prices have risen 44 percent in France since January 2020 and electricity prices are forecast to rise 10 percent this year.



What is causing all this?

To start with, it is normal that at this time of year in Europe, North America and Asia – energy prices rise in response to more demand for heating and light in the fall and winter.



What are the other factors at play?

Weather

A cold European spring and a hot Asian summer boosted energy demand.

The summer was one of the calmest on record for wind – meaning lower replenishment of stocks normally topped up by wind farms.

The winter of 2020-21 was colder than the average over the past 40 years in Europe, Russia, and Northeast Asia, meaning stockpiles of gas and coal were depleted.

Countries want to get prepared in case there is another severe northern hemisphere winter. Asian buyers are already stocking up, in turn pushing up gas prices. And investors are worried about whether enough gas has been stored for the winter.



COVID-19 pandemic

The global economy has been rebounding quickly from the pandemic. That rebound has spurred industrial production which, in turn, has spurred demand for liquefied natural gas (LNG).



LNG suppliers

Russia has been accused of piping less gas into European stockpiles. But Norway's Equinor, which is Europe's second-largest gas supplier after Russia's Gazprom, says that it will be increasing supply to meet the growing demand."
1067,"Mink vaccines, no Oktoberfest, Romania restrictions: COVID-19 Bulletin","TOP STORIES

Romania's minority government has implemented a new mask mandate, but decided to keep schools open amid rising cases and struggling hospital intensive care departments. Romania also has one of the lowest vaccination rates across Europe. Hospitality venues have been told to limit capacity and weekend curfews will be introduced for those who are not vaccinated.

Oktoberfest should be getting under way in Munich, Germany. But for the second year in succession the 187th iteration of the (usually) annual beer festival has been pushed back. The decision to suspend the festival was made in May and, despite the success of the European vaccine drive, organizers have not changed their minds.

Sticking in Germany, President Frank Walter Steinmeier has awarded 16 ""Orders of Merit"" to 10 men and six women for outstanding contributions to keep the arts and cultural life active, despite COVID-19 restrictions.

U.S. pharmaceutical firm Merck said its experimental pill to treat COVID-19 symptoms reduces the risk of hospitalization and serious illness by half. The company said it will approach global health authorities for authorization soon.

A study by doctors and researchers in Bristol, UK found no risk in administering flu jabs and COVID-19 vaccines together. As Europe prepares for winter there are concerns people may not get an annual flu vaccine for fears it would interfere with the coronavirus jabs. But the study found no negative impact on immune responses if the vaccines were given together.

Scotland's vaccine ""passport"" app launched on Thursday evening, but users are reporting early issues with the software's connection to the Scottish health service's vaccine records. A government spokesman said ""some people may be experiencing issues, which are likely to be caused by extremely high initial traffic and a large number of users trying to access the app at once. We advise people whose data is not found to try again a couple of hours later.""

Meanwhile, across the whole UK case numbers have risen during the month of September, raising concerns the reopening of schools and colleges for in-person tuition has caused the increase. The latest daily figures to September 30 show that 36,480 people tested positive for COVID-19 across the UK, an increase from the start of the month.

Finland has approved a time-limited license for an experimental COVID-19 vaccine… for mink. The jab has been developed by the University of Helsinki, and has been conditionally approved by the Finnish Food Authority. Finland's large mink fur sector is expected to begin administering the ""FurcoVac"" injection in weeks. Although many other European mink were culled after COVID-19 infections in farms, there has been no recorded Sars-Cov-2 infection in Finnish mink.

The Australian border is set to open for the first time in nearly two years in November. Since March 2020, the world's strictest controls have even stopped Australians leaving their home nation – and almost everyone was banned from arriving. ""It's time to give Australians their lives back,"" Prime Minister Scott Morrison said.

Shan He, a 33-year-old former student at the University of Sheffield, was charged on Tuesday concerning two of the incidents. She faces ""two counts of assault by beating and one count of possession of an offensive weapon.""

Another person was arrested in relation to the other incidents, but their name has not been released.

Both the police and the University of Sheffield said they were working together to protect students. And the police have increased patrols to ""provide reassurance"" to students.

On Monday, before Shan He was charged, the Chinese Consulate General in Manchester also wrote to the University of Sheffield to urge the institution to work closely with the police to protect students.

1069,Living on the border: Tensions rise in Greece over migrants,"

The events in Afghanistan have sparked fears in the European Union of a repeat of the 2015 refugee crisis. Back then, millions of migrants set out for Europe – with close to 900,000 arriving in Greece.

Then, many were sympathetic, but feelings have hardened not only within government but also among Greek people more broadly.

Sitting at the edge of Europe, Ormenio is a tiny village in the Evros region along Greece's northern border with Turkey and one of the main stops for refugees trying to enter the EU.

It is there where couple Neratzia and Kosta call home, witnessing the changes from multiple refugees crises.

""When I bought my new trousers, I washed them and hung them out to dry. When I woke up in the morning, they were gone. I washed my shoes and put them out to dry, in the morning they were also missing. I'm afraid to go out, especially during the night. I can't walk alone, I have to wait until sunrise,"" Local resident Neratzia Terzidi said.

Haunted by past waves of refugees from Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan, some Greek politicians want to avoid another large-scale influx of migrants.

In August, Greece completed a 40km-long fence on its border with Turkey and a new surveillance system is in place to stop potential asylum-seekers.

Athens says the number of illegal entries has dropped, but locals think differently.

""The government is trying to convince us that no one crosses the border. Actually it's not true, many go through, I bet if an elephant tried to cross, it would make it. I understand that it's difficult for the refugees, but it's also difficult for us, too. We have to protect ourselves. That's why we have dogs to warn us. But besides that, most of us here are hunters, I have my hunting gun ready in case we feel threatened,"" local resident Nikolaos Theoxaridis said.

When discussing the difficult situation in Afghanistan, many in Evros always respond in the same way: We cannot accept more people.

The country is looking to prevent a repeat of the events in 2020, when thousands of migrants and asylum seekers tried to storm the Greek border at Evros.

Many praised the Greek authorities then for how they handled the situation, but right now it's Greece's actions that are raising concerns.

""The impression of hatred that you get from people, the fear that you get from people, is being fed by the government rhetoric. The government is presenting people on the move, women children and men, as a danger, as a threat to our society,"" said Apostolos Veizis, executive director at the INTERSOS Hellas humanitarian organization.

Greece's Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis says the country has already shouldered a great burden and is calling on the European Union to take action.

With only a few meters separating the two sides and water levels at their lowest, the Evros river has become a popular route for migrants.

But hopes of a bilateral response to this diplomatic and humanitarian crisis remain challenging as tensions between Greece and Turkey have been simmering in recent months."
1070,Farewell furlough: UK wages subsidy ends but economy still fragile,"The biggest peacetime state intervention in the UK's labor market comes to an end Thursday, as the government winds up its ""furlough"" pandemic job subsidy program.

But calls are growing to target help at badly affected sectors such as hospitality and travel, as uncertainty about the future direction of the economy persists.

""Travel has always been very resilient,"" said Shane Mallon, general manager at Capricorn Travel in West London.

""We've gone through the ash cloud. We've gone through 9/11. We've gone through Gulf wars. But this has been by far the biggest challenge,"" he said.

The world is gradually opening up again post-pandemic, yet there is very little travel taking place outside Europe and more leisure than revenue-boosting corporate travel enquiries are coming in.

""We had our best week last week [mid-September], but that's getting us back to about 40 percent of our normal level – still nowhere near enough to be able to trade profitably. We need help over the coming six months, certainly through the winter period, to hopefully get things back to more like normality next year,"" said Mallon.

The end of the furlough wage subsidy for pandemic-hit businesses means the entire team at Capricorn Travel has compromised.

To save their jobs, and already now accustomed to a reduction in salary through furlough, all six permanent staff have dropped to a four-day week. The landlord has been understanding on the rent.

""You can't future-proof or deal with something where your income goes overnight from 100 percent to practically zero and remains that way for 14, 15 months,"" said Mallon.

""Furlough was a blessing. We would have been able to survive without furlough, but we would have lost people who've been with us probably 15, 20 years. So it has allowed us to keep particularly a talent pool within the industry and not lose it. And I think that's very, very important,"" he said.

Think tank Resolution Foundation says furlough prevented ""catastrophic levels of unemployment"" by supporting 11.6 million workers and subsidising 2.3 billion working days. The cost to the state was about $96 billion.

'Undeniable success'

Most economists agree it was money well spent.

""The furlough scheme has been an undeniable success and has salvaged the economy from what would have been a series of major job losses,"" said Victoria Scholar, head of investment at Interactive Investor.

""There is no question that this was absolutely essential,"" she said. ""The real question now is what happens next? And it comes at a rough time for the UK economy. There is a confluence of factors, not just the end of furlough – an impending cut to universal credit, the surge in gas prices and general concerns around inflation,"" she said.

Many businesses recovering from the pandemic don't have much cash and are still rebuilding their finances.

Like British Airways which warns it is facing a ""serious"" problem over wage costs, which will ""steeply increase"" when furlough ends.

Retailers are rationalizing. For instance, clothing chain Gap is closing all 81 of its UK and Republic of Ireland stores, affecting some 1,000 employees.

Official forecasts throughout the pandemic predicted unemployment to rise after the end of the furlough scheme. But the Bank of England says the UK labor market is hard to read. There may be record vacancies for chefs, lorry drivers, care assistants and fruit pickers, but those are skill sets that don't necessarily match up with those of people coming off furlough.

Permanent option?

That is why trades unions and industry groups want to see the scheme retained as a permanent option when economies hit crisis point.

""We had absolutely zero help that had been tailor-made to ourselves,"" said Mallon.

""What we could do is a part-time furlough scheme, so we could still have people in here and as we get busier, have them in three days, four days, getting back to full normality as we progressively get busier over the coming eight to nine months,"" he said.

But market watchers have a keen eye on infection rates – if a spike necessitates another lockdown, the government will be under pressure to bring furlough back.

""As we head into a harsh winter, there are potential prospects of another lockdown and so pressure to implement another furlough scheme. But at what cost?"" said Scholar."

Ireland's haulage problems have been amplified by the rising average age of truck drivers, with 27% aged 55 years and older. /VCG

A perfect storm of factors could plunge Ireland into a supply chain chaos similar to that experienced by the UK.

The COVID-19 pandemic, the Suez Canal blockage, an exodus of foreign drivers and an aging workforce are all factors weighing on Ireland's struggling haulage industry.

As reported by the Irish Road Haulage Association, the country lacks between 3,000 and 4,000 truck drivers, a shortage of around 11 percent. The association's president, Eugene Drennan, warned in The Irish Times, the country was facing ""an imminent national emergency.""

Paris's presidential 'pain'

Nikolaos Valantasis Kanellos, a lecturer in logistics at Technological University Dublin, told CGTN Europe that ""a severe and prolonged shortage might see the construction, manufacturing and waste collection industries affected with considerable repercussions for the economy and the society.""

The crisis, explained Kanellos, has been ""amplified by the aging of the current drivers, with 27 percent aged 55 years and older.""

The sector is failing to attract younger workers due to tight working conditions, with unions across the continent stating that drivers are worn out and underpaid.

Poor conditions and disillusioned workers

Aidan Flynn, general manager of the Freight Transport Association Ireland, told CGTN that ""drivers are increasingly disillusioned with their own profession because of the working conditions and significantly because of how they are treated by people and businesses they come into contact with on a daily basis.""

Though there have been warnings around growing truck driver vacancies for years, the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated the situation."" The reopening of industry during the traditional summer period has skewed supply and demand,"" said Flynn.

​​The lack of drivers is compounding the shortage in the British Isles as Central and Eastern European drivers are taking jobs closer to home. Countries such as Poland, from where a large portion of drivers once came, are booming economically, stopping the need for Poles to migrate for work.

""Eastern European drivers returned to their homeland and haven't returned,"" noted Flynn, who encouraged the Irish government to invest in apprenticeships to help fill the positions.

Consumer responsibility

Supply chain disruption looks set to continue with global issues far from being resolved, while other European nations are also burdened with vacancies. Kanellos urged consumers to be more considerate in their expectations of the industry.

""We can help give breathing space to the already stressed supply chains. No one needs five turkeys for their Christmas dinner, so let's shop responsibly to avoid panic buying and another empty selves situation."""

The UK is shaping up for a difficult winter.

Twelve energy companies have gone bust this year, affecting about 2 million homes and drivers are still nervous about petrol supplies, with lines of cars quickly forming outside petrol stations every time there's a new delivery. That's six days after the public was told not to be concerned about fuel shortages.

Meanwhile, a raft of sectors across the economy are warning the government and the public that prices are likely to go up towards Christmas as the desperate shortage of drivers bites into construction, supermarket suppliers, agriculture, and fuel.

Ministers so far have played down the situation, convinced that after a spell of panic buying some sort of equilibrium would return to the nation's gas stations.

Measures including deploying troops to drive extra trucks, a temporary lift on competition rules and the offer of 5,000 three-month visas to European truck drivers were presented as low-key last resorts.

But it's opened the lid on a situation that could be far more problematic and long term than was thus far imagined.

A brief poll of European truck drivers has revealed little or no enthusiasm to give up European Union jobs to drive in the UK again.

Miguel Brunel is from France. ""This is what they wanted,"" he says. ""All the foreign drivers they had, and even the English ones they had who left – now they can't employ them anymore. If they had managed to keep more British drivers on their books, they wouldn't be in such a state.""

His counterpart, Phil from the UK, openly expresses his anger at the changes to a job he once enjoyed.

""If there are no truck drivers – you look at what happened with the fuel,"" he says. ""If we all down tools, look what will happen, this country will grind to a halt not within days but a matter of hours.""

Over the past year, the pandemic has badly limited the testing and licensing of new drivers in the UK. But at the same time, older drivers, disillusioned by low pay and poor conditions, have been leaving the business in their droves.

The departure of the European drivers after Brexit was enough to tip the balance, leaving supermarkets, fuel refineries and meat companies struggling to shift their products.

The gas issue is more widely spread across Europe, particularly after a drop in supply from Russia. But in the UK, 2 million homes have now lost their suppliers and been automatically switched to another one without negotiation.

UK prices for household gas have quadrupled in the past year, with little expectation that the situation will improve.

If winter 2021 is a cold one, low-income homes will start facing difficult choices about heating priorities.

At the moment, these mini jolts to the economic recovery are being explained as inevitable bumps in a long road out of the extraordinary 18 months of COVID-19. But if UK citizens find themselves persistently worrying about fuel in their cars and heating in their homes, then sentiments are likely to change."

Ten percent of the world's population should have been fully vaccinated by today, according to a World Health Organization target. But 70 percent of African nations missed it.

Despite international promises to donate vaccines to poorer nations, the United Nations-backed COVAX effort has delivered only 72 million of the 300 million doses pledged to African nations. At least 8.2 million cases of COVID-19 have been diagnosed across Africa to date.

In an address marking the missed target date, WHO Africa's vaccination coordinator Richard Mihigo noted that 15 nations across Africa had achieved the 10 percent goal.

But the countries that have only vaccinated 2 percent of their populations far outweigh the successful group.

""Seventy percent of African countries have missed this important milestone to protect their most vulnerable, with half of the 52 countries ... in Africa having inoculated less than 2 percent of their populations,"" Mihigo explained.

He urged richer nations to fulfil their promises."

A former British police officer who falsely arrested a woman for breaking COVID-19 restrictions, then kidnapped, raped and murdered her, was given a rare whole-life jail term on Thursday.

Judge Adrian Fulford told Wayne Couzens, 48, his offences were ""grotesque,"" after he snatched Sarah Everard off the streets of south London in March this year.

Couzens, 48, who served with the elite diplomatic protection unit of London's Metropolitan Police, had pleaded guilty to murder, rape and kidnap.

The case shocked the country, sparking protests over male violence towards women, police inaction and low rates of prosecution in sexual assault cases. There was widespread horror and revulsion at the involvement of a police officer, who exploited lockdown restrictions and abused his position of trust to kill.

Sentencing him at the Old Bailey, the Central Criminal Court of England and Wales in central London, Fulford called Couzens' actions ""devastating, tragic and wholly brutal"" and said his victim was ""wholly blameless.""

Rare, whole-life sentence

Couzens, who will die in jail, becomes the latest of only 60 criminals in UK prisons who will never be considered for release.

""The misuse of a police officer's role such as occurred in this case in order to kidnap, rape and murder a lone victim is of equal seriousness as a murder for the purpose of advancing a political, religious, ideological cause,"" Fulford said.

Everard's family was in court to see her killer jailed. On Wednesday, they gave emotional statements describing the harrowing impact of her death.

""No punishment that you receive will ever compare to the pain and torture that you have inflicted on us,"" her father, Jeremy, told Couzens.

The high-profile case refocused attention on how the police handle complaints of violence against women and girls in Britain."

Economic watchdog, the Institute for Fiscal Studies, has warned of ""additional job losses [and] low re-employment rates for those made redundant"" after the policy ends.

At least 70 percent of African countries have fallen short of the global target to vaccinate 10 percent of all populations by the end of September. The reason is simple: A lack of available vaccines.

His conservative party, the prosecutors said, spent nearly double the 22.5 million euros (currently $19.2 million) allowed under electoral law on extravagant campaign rallies and then hired a friendly public relations agency to hide the cost.

Sarkozy has denied wrongdoing. He told the court in June he had not been involved in the logistics of his campaign for a second term as president nor in how money was spent during the election run-up.

But the court said Sarkozy was made aware of the overspending, that he did not act on it and that it was not necessary for him to approve each individual spending to be responsible.

Sarkozy was found guilty in a separate trial in March of trying to bribe a judge and peddle influence in order to obtain confidential information on a judicial inquiry. He also denied any wrongdoing in that case.

1082,Battling climate change underwater: Italy opens its first 'Smart Bay',"00:48

Climate scientists have a new tool to help protect the Mediterranean Sea from the impact of climate change: Italy's first 'Smart Bay'. The Santa Teresa Smart Bay on the Ligurian coast in north west Italy is a living laboratory under water in an area noted for tourism and diving. The location was chosen by researchers from ENEA (Italian National Agency for New Technologies, Energy and Sustainable Economic Development) and CNR (Italy's National Research Council). It is ideal for monitoring seawater by using bryozoans (aquatic invertebrate animals) and other sessile organisms that are anchored to something as 'living sensors'.

The amount of acidity and the level of oxygen of the Mediterranean Sea is of particular concern. As the body of water becomes hotter and more acidic, the habitat of many native species would be permanently changed. There are also fears of violent changes in weather systems, such as increased frequency in Mediterranean tornadoes.

Chiara Lombardi is a marine biologist and ENEA researcher who has created an underwater 'farm' of bryozoans and marine polychaete worms. These animals use the carbonates in water to grow their shells. Due to a rise in water acidity levels linked to pollution and and high temperatures, Lombardi assesses how the growth of the animals has slowed down. An underwater probe called 'Tinetto' also allows Lombardi to assess the pH and levels of oxygen of the water, which are two vital measures of the health of the Mediterranean and its marine population.

""What we are doing is monitoring the carbonate chemistry of the water as well as physical properties and what we have been observing is that climate change is occurring in the Mediterranean sea"", Lombardi told Reuters. ""We are monitoring pH which is also related to ocean acidification and the oxygen level which is related to hypoxia which is causing a lot of damage around the Mediterranean ecosystem including also the aquaculture,"" she said.

There are hopes that the Smart Bay will work alongside local businesses, particularly involving local fisherman and the tourist industry, to make their work more eco-friendly in the future. ""The idea is to try to help a local administration to point the attention about climate change and try to use new strategies for the growth in the future which are sustainable which also are using the ecosystem and the natural capital as a source of changes,"" Lombardi said. ""In terms of the bay, the long-term plan is to try to convert this bay which is around sustainable tourism and diving and natural capital as a carbon-neutrality bay.""

However, the bay can also provide useful data for the study of extreme weather events that are becoming more common in European countries such as Italy, Greece, Spain and France. Franco Reseghetti, an ENEA researcher and ocean expert, says that even though data gathering is getting better, researchers still do not have the answers as to why things appear to be changing and importantly how to stop it.

""Analysing the phenomenon, we can say that in the past few years we have noticed a mass of warm, salty water that slowly came from the coast of Sicily, arrived halfway up the coast of Sardinia and into the Corsican Channel, and then sank into the Ligurian Sea. And we don't know why, which shows us how great our ignorance is, unfortunately,"" he said. ""The Mediterranean Sea has basically become a hotspot of what is happening globally in the world's oceans. This is a bit worrying, not only from the point of view of changes in the living species that now find totally different living conditions but also because these conditions lead to extreme and violent atmospheric events... The problem could be that in the long term the Mediterranean could completely change its characteristics."" Speaking about the importance of the Mediterranean for surrounding countries amid an increase in natural disasters such as forest fires, Reseghetti warns: ""These extreme events should make us think that perhaps it really is time to stop talking and start acting.""

A serving London police officer handcuffed a woman on the pretext that she broke COVID-19 lockdown rules before he kidnapped and killed her, a prosecutor said Wednesday. Wayne Couzens, 48, appeared at London's Central Criminal Court to be sentenced after he admitted the abduction, rape and murder of 33-year-old Sarah Everard, who disappeared while walking home from visiting a friend in south London on March 3. The case has sparked national outrage and triggered large-scale protests denouncing violence against women and a lack of police protection.

Couzens sat in a packed courtroom with his head bowed as members of Everard's family listened to prosecutor Tom Little open his case. Little said Couzens wore his police belt with handcuffs and used his police identification when he detained Everard ""by fraud."" He had also rented a car as part of his plan, the prosecutor argued. There was ""no credible alternative explanation for his need to hire a car other than to use that car to kidnap and rape a lone woman,"" Little said. ""His movements were consistent with the defendant looking for, or hunting for, a lone young female to kidnap and rape, which is precisely what he did,"" the prosecutor argued.

Britain's government said in the wake of Everard's killing that it would invest millions of pounds more in its ""Safer Streets"" fund to put more officers on the streets and improve street lighting and closed-circuit television facilities to protect women and girls. The killing of 28-year-old primary school teacher Sabina Nessa, who was found dead in a London park earlier this month, has put renewed focus on the safety of women. Ahead of Wednesday's court hearing in the Couzens case, the Metropolitan Police department said it was ""sickened, angered and devastated by this man's crimes, which betray everything we stand for."" The force said it wouldn't further comment until the hearing is over. A judge is expected to sentence Couzens, who was dismissed from the force, on Thursday.

1084,Fears rise as lava from La Palma volcano reaches the Atlantic Ocean,"00:59

Red hot lava, which has been spewing from the Cumbre Vieja volcano on the Spanish Canary Island La Palma, reached the Atlantic Ocean on Tuesday, nine days after it first erupted. Footage from Spain's Guardia Civil Police captured big clouds of white steam blanketing the sky in the Playa Nueva area as the 1,000 degrees Celsius molten lava made contact with a cliff and met the ocean.

Officials have warned that the lava flowing into the sea could trigger explosions and clouds of toxic gases. The Canary Islands' emergency service has also urged those within a 2-mile radius to stay indoors and block up any gaps in properties to prevent toxic gases from entering their homes. There are concerns that the thermal shock from the lava hitting the water could release toxic hydrochloric acid vapor into the atmosphere, which irritates the eyes and skin. Local officials have also warned that there could be explosions.

The lava flow produced by the Cumbre Vieja volcano reached the Atlantic Ocean in Los Girres beach in Tazacorte on the Canary Island of La Palma. /Sunsets Sweden/AFP The lava flow produced by the Cumbre Vieja volcano reached the Atlantic Ocean in Los Girres beach in Tazacorte on the Canary Island of La Palma. /Sunsets Sweden/AFP

Spain classified La Palma as a disaster zone on Tuesday. The government announced an initial financial aid package of $12.3 million, around half of which will be going towards buying houses and the rest towards acquiring furniture and essential household goods, according to government spokesperson Isabel Rodriguez. At least 600 houses and banana plantations have been destroyed and 6,000 people have been evacuated on the island, which neighbors Tenerife in the Canary Islands archipelago off the North African coast and is home to 85,000 people. No injuries have been reported so far.

1085,Angry Romanian truck drivers may be lured to the UK,"Romanian truck drivers spent Wednesday protesting pay cuts in front of government headquarters in Bucharest, saying conditions could force people to seek work abroad. The action came as Britain offered three-month visas for European drivers in an effort to avoid major supply chain delays due to a shortage of hauliers.

Around 100 trucks spent the day parked in Victory Square, representing three transport unions that came together to protest pay cuts, the cost of insurance and COVID-19 quarantine rules.

Rome's Tiber river 'at risk'

Earlier in the year, Romania began treating lorry drivers' daily allowances as taxable income as well as taxing transport firms retroactively over five years on the allowances.

One union official told the media an average driver could end up paying more than $100,000 in back taxes. Protesters say it is financially devastating and it could close some transport businesses, forcing drivers to look for work outside Romania's borders.

Other European countries such as Poland, Hungary and Lithuania are seen to be adopting measures to protect their carriers – Romanian drivers want to see similar changes at home. In the hours before the protests began, the ruling Liberal Party unveiled a draft bill to remove the back tax payment, but the measure may not make it into law.

The protests came as the UK government offered three-month visas in an attempt to encourage people to help cut its shortage of drivers in the lead up to Christmas.

The UK needs tens of thousands more drivers, with Brexit and the coronavirus pandemic causing a knock-on effect that is impacting supply chains.

Other countries including the U.S. and Germany are also facing driver shortages and many European drivers have said they wouldn't head to the UK with only the security of a three-month visa. Drivers from Central and Eastern Europe have also spoken up, alleging they chose to leave the UK due to poor pay and conditions, some of which were heightened by the pandemic and Brexit.

While some Romanian drivers said a three-month stay was not enough of an incentive, others said they would consider working in Britain.

Some admitted the pay was tempting and see Britain as an option if conditions in Romania don't improve.

Nicolae, a 32-year-old haulier, told the media: ""The Brits' offer is attractive,"" explaining the tax he'll pay on three trucks was a squeeze for a small business. ""Britain is an option ... earnings there are way higher,"" he said."

""At present, the world is undergoing profound changes unseen in a century. Uncertainties, risks and challenges are increasing,"" Zheng told an online audience.

""Amid these unprecedented changes, China is striving forward, with confidence and in firm steps, towards building a strong and modern socialist country in a comprehensive way.""

Zheng said a lack of ""mutual understanding"" was to blame for a deterioration in relations between London and Beijing and called for ""candid dialogue on the basis of equality and mutual respect,"" to ease tensions.

China's National Day is celebrated with a week-long holiday in honor of the founding of the People's Republic in 1949, following a bitter and protracted civil war."
1087,Can you 'party away' the benefit of COVID-19 vaccination?,"The benefits of having a COVID-19 vaccination have become clearer with each passing week. In the UK, the real-world figures suggest that being fully vaccinated cuts your chance of getting infected with COVID-19 by 70 percent or more. Vaccines also cut your chances of being ill enough to end up in hospital by somewhere between 90 percent and 99 percent.

But what if you change your lifestyle after getting jabbed and head out to packed restaurants, sporting events, cinemas and gyms, believing you are now pretty much immune to COVID-19? Each of those visits increases your chance of getting COVID-19 – so is it possible to work out how many nights out you could have before you ""use up"" the 70 percent infection protection from your injections? Kevin McConway is emeritus professor of applied statistics at the Open University in the UK and he says that on the theoretical level it is possible to work it out. But for each of us as individuals, there are so many variables that there is no way a reliable figure could be put on it. ""Basically, if vaccinated people started going out three times as much as they did and the unvaccinated people didn't, then they'd roughly be at the same infection risk. But, you know, there's just two very big ifs in that,"" he explained.

06:46

The reason for the caveats in the real world is that these are relative figures and don't take into account the amount of COVID-19 around, so the level of risk you might run into if you go to, say, a crowded cafe. ""One point to take into account is it isn't only vaccinated people who are going out more than they did. The same is probably true of unvaccinated people, too,"" says McConway.

Getting a COVID-19 vaccination can be a moment of joy. /VCG Getting a COVID-19 vaccination can be a moment of joy. /VCG

This could be for all sorts of reasons, such as maybe their employer no longer allowing them to work from home so much, he says. ""So they have got to go into the office and be in contact with a lot more people on the train, or however they commute. Then there are more opportunities to go out – you can go to football matches, music festivals and concerts and things like that, which nobody vaccinated, or not vaccinated, had the chance to do until fairly recently. ""And so it's probably the case that the chance of getting infected has gone up in both unvaccinated and vaccinated people,"" he adds. READ MORE: Vaccines still work, even if people still get COVID-19 How much does vaccine effectiveness wane? Italy makes COVID health pass compulsory for all workers

But the fact is that if you had an identical twin who led the same lifestyle as you and, unlike you they had not been vaccinated, you would basically have 30 percent of the risk your twin had of getting COVID-19. However, that risk level is a relative figure. ""If things are really awful and the chance of getting infected in a fairly short time was 10 percent, say, in unvaccinated people, that would mean a cut to 3 percent in the vaccinated people, which is a good reduction. ""But on the other hand, if you know there's not much infection about and there's, say, a one-in-a-thousand risk of unvaccinated people getting infected, well, it could be three in 10,000 in the vaccinated people. And that would be a reduction – in one sense, it's a substantial reduction, but on the other hand, it's a very low risk,"" explains McConway.

McConway says no-one knows how many unvaccinated people there are. /CGTN McConway says no-one knows how many unvaccinated people there are. /CGTN

On a brighter note, it is simpler when it comes to working out the impact of a 95 percent reduction in a vaccinated person's chance of being hospitalized with COVID-19. As McConway explains, although changes in behavior could increase someone's chance of getting COVID-19, it has not yet been shown to have had an impact on their chances of being hospitalized, beyond the risk increasing because they have COVID-19. Hospitalization rates by age group But the thing to remember, he says, is that the 95 percent reduction in hospitalization risks for people who are vaccinated is relative to the risk you might have had if not vaccinated. So, in simple terms, after being vaccinated you have cut your chance of being hospitalized with COVID-19 to one-in-20 of whatever your unvaccinated risk was, assuming all other things remain the same. And this protection is roughly the same for all age groups, so for healthy teenagers and young adults, who have very small risks of hospitalization, they will only have one 20th (5 percent) of that already very low risk after vaccination – assuming they don't change behavior. For elderly people, though, the rate of hospitalization with COVID-19 has been much, much higher throughout the pandemic, so cutting this figure by 95 percent saves many, many people from hospital or worse. These percentages are based on large-scale populations. On an individual level, it is common sense that if you are vaccinated, and reduce your chances of contracting COVID-19 by continuing to take public health precautions, you are also cutting your chance of being hospitalized or worse. But are people throwing caution to the wind after vaccination? No, not according to this table from a report prepared for the UK government's advisory Sage group, which shows no noticeable increase in the number of social contacts people have had compared with the same period in summer 2020, which was before anyone had had a vaccination:"

Russia has threatened to block YouTube, as the Kremlin called for ""zero tolerance"" towards the video hosting giant. The move comes after YouTube removed Russian state-backed broadcaster RT's German-language channels from its platform.

On Tuesday, the online video company, owned by Google's parent company Alphabet Inc, deleted RT's German-language channels, saying they had breached its COVID-19 misinformation policy.

YouTube said on Wednesday that it would block all anti-vaccine content, moving beyond COVID-19 to include content that alleges vaccines cause chronic health effects or contains misinformation on the substances in vaccines.

Russia announced it was considering retaliating against German media and accused YouTube of ""unprecedented information aggression.""

Roskomnadzor, the Russian state communications regulator, said it had written to Google and demanded that the YouTube restrictions on the RT channels be lifted. Russia could partially or fully restrict access to YouTube if it failed to comply, it added.

Google declined to comment on the matter, according to Reuters.

'Zero tolerance'

Russia could impose measures to force YouTube to comply with its laws, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters, adding that the law appeared to have been broken in this case.

""There should certainly be zero tolerance for this kind of breaking of the law,"" he said.

Russia's foreign ministry said it would draw up ""a proposal to develop and take retaliatory measures against the YouTube hosting service and the German media.""

The TASS news agency reported that Vasily Piskarev, a lawmaker who heads a parliamentary commission to investigate foreign interference, said Russia had grounds to take measures against German media company Deutsche Welle.

Christian Mihr, executive director at Reporters Without Borders (RSF) Germany, said the threat of action against German journalists was ""completely inappropriate."" Berlin denied an allegation by the Russian foreign ministry that YouTube's decision had been made with clear and tacit support from the German authorities and local media.

""It is a decision by YouTube, based on rules created by YouTube. It is not a measure [taken by] the German government or other official organizations,"" German government spokesperson Steffen Seibert told reporters.

Russia scrutinizes 'Big Tech'

Moscow has increased pressure on foreign technology firms in the past year, fining social media companies for failing to delete content Russia deems illegal and punitively slowing down the speed of Twitter.

Separately on Wednesday, Russia fined Google 6.5 million roubles ($89,534), the latest in a series of small penalties for failing to delete content that Moscow deems illegal.

The Kremlin's critics say that mounting pressure on Google and Apple pushed the media giants to remove an anti-government tactical voting app from their stores on the first day of a parliamentary election this month."

The government has quietly acknowledged that troops are being readied for deployment in the next couple of days but the overall message from Downing Street is that it's the same the world over and this will pass soon.

""All we want to do is make sure that we have all the preparations necessary to get through to Christmas,"" said Prime Minister Boris Johnson in his first appearance since the stations ran dry. ""We've seen the global economy really sucking in a huge amount of demand at the moment.""

It was left to Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng to mention that soldiers would soon be driving the petrol lorries.

Union leaders continue to press the government to step up the response and allocate measures for key workers to be able to fill up.

""It's getting to a point where I might not be able to make my shift,"" said one woman in a pre-dawn queue. ""So that's not ideal when you work in a hospital or anywhere, really.""

Howard Cox from the Fair Fuel campaign says it's all about drivers. ""The only thing we can do at the moment to get back to some sort of normality, is to get the 100, 200 military drivers to actually start delivering to forecourts because all of the tankers, refineries are full up with diesel and petrol ready to go,"" he said.

A temporary visa offer for 5,000 drivers from Europe is in but a group of Polish truckers by the roadside today seemed less than impressed. ""No thank you, Mr Prime Minister,"" said 35-year-old Jakub Pajka. ""I do not think anyone would want to relocate for three months just to help the British sort out their Christmas.""

The official position is that time will gradually resolve the situation. One estimate is that it will take about a week for the entire country to fill up and then demand will drop.

The Petrol Retailers Association (PRA) has said signs are encouraging, with 27 percent of its 5,500 stations out of fuel on Wednesday compared with two-thirds running dry on Sunday."

""The flyers are now useless for our campaign,"" AfD co-leader Tino Chrupalla said ahead of the vote. ""This is precisely the goal of those behind this operation. They are trying to intentionally harm the AfD in the election.""

In response, the collective explained: ""We adhered to the corona recommendations of the federal government: 'We were lazy like raccoons and did absolutely nothing,'"" according to German media, referring to a government commercial during the pandemic that called for people to stay at home.

According to ZPS, the AfD had delivered some 5 million flyers to the ""ZPS logistics chain,"" which said the material arrived without ""an order confirmation or a legally valid contract.""

The group stated that its service was unable to deliver the leaflets as ""the terms and conditions of the service provider expressly exclude the distribution of 'propaganda and false statements as well as advertising materials of political parties.'""

The AfD has already announced it intends to make a criminal complaint, while Chrupalla spoke of a ""massive interference in the democratic election campaign.""

The party entered the Bundestag in 2017, achieving 12.6 percent of the vote. Despite the decline in 2021, the AfD emerged on Sunday as the largest party in the states of Saxony and Thuringia, reaffirming its support in Germany's east.

Sunday's results will likely see Germany governed by a coalition. However, all major political parties have ruled out working with the AfD due to its extremely right-wing political positions.

France has rebounded from the disappointment and anger of having its submarine contract with Australia torn up by signing new arms deals with Greece and Czechia. First came an announcement from Greece's Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, standing alongside France's President Emmanuel Macron, of the deal to buy at least six France-built warships. And France's Armed Forces Ministry on Wednesday confirmed the nation was ready to sell 52 Caesar artillery weapons to Czechia for $301m. The deal follows Czech cooperation with France's military mission in the Sahel region of North Africa.

For $5 billion, Greece will receive three Belharra frigates and three Gowind corvettes, with an option for one more of each on delivery. It is hoped all the ships will be delivered to Athens by 2026, with the first frigate arriving in 2024. The French defense contractor Naval Group won the contract over U.S. firm Lockheed Martin after a three-year battle following Mitsotakis's declaration that Greece's navy needs more ships. The option to sign the deal with a French firm also followed French naval assistance for Greece's military in the ​​Aegean and the Eastern Mediterranean. The area is seen by many as key for the security of Europe and the EU due to its popularity as a route for migrants and refugees. ""It's not a simple arms sale. It's a strategic deal that changes the situation in the east Mediterranean,"" lawmaker Dimitris Kairidis told Al Jazeera.

While the wider context of both the arms deals is the soc-called AUSUK pact between Australia, the U.S. and the UK, which France's Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian described as a ""stab in the back,"" the intra-European deals are signs of a European independence and united defense strategy, according to Macron. ""We have a commitment to the independence of Europe. This is part of the common struggles we have undertaken in Europe – technological independence, a European defence, and combat-readiness,"" Macron said of the deal with Greece. ""This [deal] comes after a period of rapprochement with Czechia that was marked on a strategic level, but also a vision that is closer to what European defence policy should be and should bring us,"" an official told reporters in Prague, ahead of Armed Forces Minister Florence Parly's planned visit to sign the contract.

So-called ""Long Covid"" might not be the only virus to leave long-term effects – a study by academics at Oxford University found patients who caught influenza often still suffered symptoms six months after catching it. But the data suggest long-term COVID-19 symptoms may be more common than other long-term viruses.

More research into ""Long Covid"" symptoms has suggested an apparently simple solution for one lingering effect of the virus. Researchers at the University of East Anglia are starting a trial to see whether Vitamin A (or retinol) can help patients recover their sense of smell. It's thought the vitamin can help repair injured ""olfactory pathways"" or nerves that allow people to smell.

Romania has posts a new record high of daily infections, with 11,049 cases identified on Tuesday alone and 208 people have died from the virus in the past 24 hours. Only 33 percent of adult Romanians have been fully vaccinated, which is one of the lowest figures in any EU member state.

The UK said it would grant 12 out of 47 applications for new licenses to small boats from the European Union (EU) to fish in its waters, provoking an angry response from France.

French fishermen have become increasingly angry over how Britain has controlled access for EU boats to its waters after it exited the bloc.

London says it has pursued a ""reasonable approach,"" issuing nearly 1,700 licenses to EU boats to fish in Britain's exclusive economic zone, which is defined as being 12 to 200 nautical miles from the coast.

""We have been considering applications for vessels of under 12 meters in length to fish in this zone and, on the basis of the evidence available, we are able to grant licenses for 12 of the 47 applications made.""

But France's Maritime Minister Annick Girardin called it ""a new British refusal to apply the conditions of the Brexit accord.""

Her only remaining priority was to get the licenses for French fishing boats, ""as provided for by the agreement,"" she added.

""French fishing must not be held hostage by the British for political ends.""

Channel Islands dispute

Britain said the other applications had been rejected because of insufficient evidence the boats had fished in the area between 2012 and 2016, as stipulated in the post-Brexit agreement reached last year between London and Brussels.

London insisted its ""approach has been reasonable and fully in line with our commitments in the Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA).""

The list of successful vessels is due to be published on Wednesday.

France said 87 applications have been made, with the discrepancy revolving around licenses for vessels that replaced older boats that had previously fished in the area.

Britain and France are also at loggerheads over fishing rights in the British Channel islands of Jersey and Guernsey.

On Wednesday, Jersey said it has granted 95 fishing licenses to French trawlers. The government in Saint Helier said it will issue 64 full licenses and 31 temporary licenses, in addition to the 47 vessels already given permission earlier this year, while 75 applications were refused."

The UK government has put the military on standby to alleviate a shortage of fuel truck drivers. Some 75 military tanker drivers are ready to be operational and this number could be doubled. However, the trucking industry says it's barely a drop in the ocean when the country is suffering from a shortage of approximately 100,000 drivers.

1100,Poland considers extending 'state of emergency' over migrant extremism,"01:54

Poland's interior minister has asked for a state of emergency along the border with Belarus to be extended for 60 days after six migrants died along the eastern border with Belarus in the past two months. Mariusz Kaminski also warned some migrants that have been detained ""were carrying proof of radicalism,"" including links to the Taliban and the so-called Islamic State (ISIS). It comes as Belarus's President Alexander Lukashenko blamed the West for what he called a ""looming humanitarian catastrophe,"" with migrants stranded in freezing conditions on the border of Poland and Belarus. Poland and its neighbors Latvia and Lithuania have experienced a surge in border crossings since the beginning of summer – accusing Belarus of flying migrants in and pushing them toward the borders in an act of hybrid warfare.

Polish ministers acknowledged the situation on the border with Belarus is growing increasingly tense, as the interior minister requested to extend a state of emergency for an extra 60 days. At least five people have died on the frontier in recent weeks, four people within Polish territory while one body was found on the Belarus side of the border.

Poland says 9,400 migrants have tried to cross from Belarus since early August – 8,200 were stopped and 1,200 people placed in detention within Poland. Polish authorities claim they've found material linked to Islamic extremism on the phones of some people trying to cross into the EU, alleging they pose a threat to national security. Opposition politicians have accused the ruling right-wing nationalist Law and Justice party in the past of stoking prejudice against immigrants for political gain, with human rights groups saying the migrants pose no threat and are being stigmatized. Images have been released from Belarusian authorities showing people stuck in the border area near Poland's three-meter-high barbed-wire fence. Lukashenko has blamed the West for the issues on the border with Poland as his government faces U.S. and EU sanctions following last year's disputed election and a crackdown on protests. He spoke on local media addressing the border situation: ""Let's discuss how we are going to work on it further. This is wrong that people are suffering. ""Yes, we dressed them, we brought them some firewood and some shawls. But they would freeze in winter. Those are people who walked thousands of kilometers from the south. To put it short: it's a humanitarian catastrophe on the border.""

Zheng suggested world powers should reject ""colonial mentality"" and ""other moves that lead to division or confrontation.""

Despite recent London-Beijing tensions, Amanda Milling, the UK minister for Asia, was in attendance. She reiterated the UK's desire ""to work with China in order to overcome the great challenges of our time – in particular, climate change, biodiversity loss, COVID-19 and the risk of future pandemics.""

The Green Party has said it will prioritize talks with the liberal, pro-business, Free Democratic Party (FDP) and the SPD, however, key issues could yet undermine any potential agreement.

Climate change

The center-left Green party wants to accelerate the energy transition and bring about an earlier exit from coal in 2030, eight years before the current end date.

Its ""right now"" program calls for significant investments in renewable energy to massively boost Germany's production capacities, a broad goal supported by the other parties but by starkly divergent means.

The FPD emphasizes market solutions to climate problems and would not bring forward the coal deadline. Neither, for that matter, would the SPD.

Debt limit

Any coalition between the FDP and the Greens would see the parties confronting the controversial question of debt.

The Greens' investment plan ""implies big tensions with the FDP, which wants budgetary orthodoxy,"" says Paul Maurice, an expert on German politics from the French Institute of International Relations (IFRI).

The FDP wants to stick to a constitutional debt brake that does not allow deficits to exceed 0.35 percent of gross domestic product. In contrast, the Green party wants to loosen it to allow 500 billion euros ($585 billion) of extra spending over the next 10 years.

It's been two years since the last Glastonbury music festival was held in rural western England, but scientists say the event, which is usually held annually, has a lasting effect on the area's wildlife.

The levels of cocaine and MDMA (ecstasy) detected in a river running through the site were so high wildlife living downstream could be caused significant harm, according to researchers.

""Unfortunately, Glastonbury Festival's close proximity to a river results in any drugs released by festival attendees having little time to degrade in the soil before entering the fragile freshwater ecosystem,"" said Dan Aberg, a postgraduate student at Bangor University in Wales.

Samples were taken by the Bangor team in 2019, both before and after 200,000 people flocked to Worthy Farm in Somerset to see Stormzy, The Killers and The Cure headline the festival.

Ecstasy levels in the local groundwater and rivers were four times higher the week after the festival."

Some residents had to lower themselves from balconies using tied sheets as a fire broke out following the blast in the early hours of the morning.

The authorities suspect some kind of device was placed at the scene, spokesperson Thomas Fuxborg told a news conference.

The end of Angela Merkel's reign at the top of German politics has been signed off with her conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party posting the worst election results in its history. In a narrow victory, the Social Democratic Party (SPD) captured 25.7 percent of all votes against the CDU's 24.1 percent, it now appears that the future of Germany will be determined by how strong a coalition the SPD can build.

READ MORE Full coverage of German elections Auf Wiedersehen Mutti China and Germany's car connection Both parties are likely to court the same coalition parties – the Greens, who won 14.8 percent of the votes, and the Free Democrats, who won 11.5 percent. SPD candidate Olaf Scholz had made clear his party will try to enter into a coalition with these two parties. ""A social, environmental, liberal coalition does have a past here in Germany, there's a tradition we can build on and it's what we need to do if we can tackle the challenges of the future,"" Scholz told reporters.

Social Democratic Party (SPD) Traditionally, the SPD has stood for workers' rights and social justice, though it's not clear exactly what its candidate Olaf Scholz, who presented himself as Merkel's successor in maintaining stability and economic growth in Germany, stands for.

It's in the industrial region of western Germany, like North Rhine-Westphalia and Hesse, that the party counts its most loyal following. One of the key promises made by Scholz during his electoral campaign was raising the minimum wage to $14. During the electoral campaign, the party has presented itself as the one able to carry Germany forward in the challenges of the future: digitalization, mobility and climate change. On climate policies, the SPD's goal is to ensure only renewable energy sources provide power by 2040, discourage air travel while making rail more appealing and practical, and phasing out coal by 2038.

Christian Democratic Union It's traditionally been the party of choice for Christian conservatives, the over-60s and those living in rural areas of the country. During his electoral campaign, CDU chancellor candidate Armin Laschet ruled out cutting taxes to promote economic recovery after the pandemic and called for the reinstatement of the EU's pre-pandemic budget rules. In regards to climate policies, Laschet was criticized by both the Greens and the SPD for his lack of ambition, as the CDU candidate reportedly said during his campaign that pursuing green policies too quickly would threaten jobs and cause instability in Germany. The CDU is firmly committed to the target of reaching climate neutrality by 2045, phasing out coal-fired power generation by 2038 and expanding renewable energies.

Green Party Support for the Green Party has grown significantly in recent years, peaking with this year's electoral result that set them right after the SDP and CDU. The party's voters include the well-educated, well-off urban population, but they struggle to reach lower-income voters. While the SPD and CDU suffered significant losses at the 2019 elections, the Greens experienced a surprising surge in support, especially from young voters concerned with the climate crisis. Unsurprisingly environmentalism remains at the core of this party, while other policies regarding taxes and social issues set them to the left of politics, with the Greens calling for higher taxes for top earners. Greens want to accelerate the energy transition and bring about an earlier exit from coal in 2030, eight years before the current end date. They also call for bigger investments in renewable energy. It's likely that the issue of public debt will make a coalition with the FDP an uncomfortable union: the Greens want to loosen the limit on debt to allow $585 billion of extra spending over the next 10 years. Following the election results, Green Party co-leader Robert Habeck told German radio station Deutschlandfunk that ""the SPD is, from what we've seen so far, the more progressive party.""

Free Democrats (FDP) The neoliberal, pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) gained 11.5 percent of the votes, ranking as the fourth party after SPD, CDU and the Green Party. They stand for business first, though they're socially less conservative than the CDU. They want climate protection but they're opposed to raising taxes that would harm businesses. Unlike the Greens, the FDP is unwilling to bring forward the coal deadline and increase taxes, and it's more likely to suggest market solutions to the climate crisis. Around the controversial issue of debt, the FDP wants to stick to a constitutional debt brake that does not allow deficits to exceed 0.35 percent of gross domestic product. Its policies aim to bring forward the digitalization of the country, a much-discussed necessity for Germany, where a subpar digital network and redundant, dysfunctional bureaucracy have been laid bare by the crisis triggered by the pandemic last year.

1111,How has the pandemic worsened the gender pay gap?,"09:53

WHAT'S THE ISSUE? Earlier this year, the World Economic Forum published a report showing that the COVID-19 pandemic had set gender parity back by at least a generation. And a report from the International Labour Organization showed that women are far more likely than men to work in sectors affected by the pandemic, and to take time off to care for their families. It also found an alarming nine out of 10 women who have been put out of work by the pandemic may be lost to the world of work for good. So how could this gender imbalance be corrected? Guy Ryder, Director-General of the International Labour Organization (ILO), joins The Agenda with Stephen Cole to explain.

MEET THE EXPERT Guy Ryder was elected as ILO Director General in October 2012 and re-elected in 2016. He first joined the ILO in 1998 as Director of the Bureau for Workers' Activities and, from 1999, as Director of the Officer of the Director-General. It was during this time that the ILO's Decent Work Agenda was launched. In 2002, he was appointed General Secretary of the ICFTU, leading the process of global unification of the democratic international trade union movement. He was then elected as first General Secretary of the International Trade Union Confederation in 2006. He headed international trade union delegations to high-level talks with the UN, IMF, World Bank and WTO and to the G20 Leaders' Summit. In September 2010, Ryder returned to the ILO as Executive Director, responsible for international labor standards and fundamental principles and rights at work.

WHAT DOES RYDER SAY? Ryder has no doubt that women have been hardest hit by the pandemic. They're more likely to have to leave the workforce to care for relatives and more likely to work in sectors worst affected by the crisis. ""What is worrying in particular is that nine out of every 10 women who have moved out of their jobs during the pandemic have actually left the labor force,"" he says. ""They're not unemployed, they're 'inactive,' as the economists would say. So the question becomes, how will these women come back into the labor force?"" Ryder says there is an answer: ""It's one of the lessons of the pandemic to really look in a new way about the provision of care in our societies. Now, we all know that women pick up the great majority of unpaid care responsibilities for reasons which have to do with tradition as much as anything else.""

That doesn't come for free – indeed Ryder suggests an overhaul of global social care could cost around $1.2 trillion a year. While conceding that the figure may seem expensive, Ryder notes that ""we found $16 trillion to deal with the effects of the pandemic. It's a matter of choice and perspective."" And the world can make the right choices by focusing on the right areas, Ryder adds: ""We need to make specific efforts to have women come back into the world of work and on equal terms. We need to prevent this locked-down generation of young people from being lost to the world of work."""
1112,Hungary signs long-term gas deal with Russia's Gazprom,"As the UK struggles with a gas crisis and prices surge in Europe, Hungary has secured a long-term supply deal with Russia. State-owned Gazprom, one of the world's largest gas suppliers, will ship natural gas to Hungary for the next 15 years.

Hungary's foreign minister has described the deal as ""flexible."" After 10 years, Hungary has the option to change its purchase amounts from the 4.5 billion cubic meters the country has secured annually – a seven percent increase on Hungary's gas use last year.

The new contract comes as a 25-year agreement that shipped Russian gas via Ukrainian pipelines comes to an end.

China and Germany's car connection

Signing the deal in Budapest, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto described it as vital for the country's national security.

""Here in Hungary, energy supply is a matter of security, sovereignty and economics but not politics,"" he told the media. ""Flats, homes and apartments cannot be heated with political manifestos, only with gas. The same is true with industry.""

Szijjarto also accused Ukraine of meddling in Hungary's internal affairs after Kyiv criticized Budapest for signing the deal. Ukraine, which stands to lose millions in transit payments, called the deal a ""purely political, economically unreasonable decision.""

Russia has moved away from its Ukrainian gas export route, constructing the undersea Nord Stream pipelines direct to Germany and the TurkStream link from Russia to Turkey.

Diversifying connections

Hungary has invested in diversifying its connection points to bring in gas from neighboring countries, and 3.5 billion cubic meters, the majority of gas in this new deal, will arrive via Serbia. The other billion cubic meters will come from Austria under the new deal, which begins on October 1.

According to local media reports, Gazprom is ready to increase supplies to Europe and is interested in more supply contracts. In the past, the Russian gas giant has been accused by the International Energy Agency and members of the European Parliament of not doing enough to increase its gas supplies to Europe, where prices have soared.

On the price Hungary has paid for the Russian gas in this contract, Szijjarto described it as ""much more favorable"" than the pricing in the 1996 deal, but no price details have been released. The Foreign Minister claims overhead costs are being kept down so that Hungarians pay the lowest gas price in Europe.

Russia has been selling gas to Hungary for almost five decades, and 2025 will mark 50 years of cooperation. The new Gazprom deal means that cooperation is set to continue until at least 2036.

COVID-19 risks pushing back the battle against extreme poverty by generations, according to the United Nations, but many see technology as an opportunity to leapfrog development stages and undo much of the damage.

""I think we have to remember that 3.7 billion people do not have digital connectivity and almost a billion of people still do not have electricity,"" said Mari Pangestu told CGTN Europe's Innovation, Action, Change program.

""So before you can talk about digital connectivity, first of all, you have to have them connected with electricity,"" said Pangestu, managing director of development policy and partnerships at the World Bank.

The UK government is beset with potential bear traps for the coming winter. Energy prices are escalating sharply with smaller companies in danger of going out of business, one after the after. As the days get shorter and the country tries to put the pandemic behind it, there are growing concerns about public resilience against a combination of flu and COVID-19. And now, lines of cars are blocking petrol forecourts as worried drivers ignore government pleas not to panic-buy fuel for their vehicles. There's plenty of fuel, say ministers, just a shortage of drivers for the tankers.

""There is no shortage of petrol, plenty of petrol in both our refineries and in storage,"" says Environment Minister George Eustice. ""The only reason we don't have [it on] petrol forecourts is that people are buying petrol when they don't need it."" That may be so, but as the lines grow longer, public anxiety is growing as well. There are reports now that nearly two-thirds of the UK's 8,000 petrol stations are dry and that forecourt closures in Britain's cities are up to 90 percent. A Petrol Retailers Association spokesperson said that stations can't restock fast enough, and that one station was refilled at midday and then emptied by the end of the same afternoon. The government has pulled one lever by temporarily exempting the oil industry from the Competition Act 1998, designed to prevent companies creating monopolies. The fuel companies will for now be able to tackle the current logistics dilemma together, even filling each other's stations if necessary.

1115,San Marino becomes one of last European states to legalize abortion,"She told AP that she was pleased with the outcome.

""We supported this for the simple reason that it seemed right that women have a choice and aren't forced to go somewhere else, but to have the services on our own territory,"" said Sara Casadei, a member of Noi Ci Siamo, which campaigned for the ""Yes"" vote.

Before this, people seeking abortions had to travel to Italy, which surrounds San Marino, to get the procedure done out of pocket for around $1,765.

The residents of the tiny enclave of San Marino have voted overwhelmingly to legalize abortion, ending a 150-year-old ban. Around 77.3 percent of people voted yes in Sunday's referendum to allow abortions up to 12 weeks of pregnancy.

People will also be able to get an abortion after the 12-week mark if the pregnancy would cause them physically or psychologically harm or if the fetus has abnormalities. San Marino is one of the last countries in Europe to lift its total ban, enacted in 1865.

Before this referendum, someone who had an abortion could have faced three years in prison while the person who performed it could be imprisoned for six years – although the country has not convicted anyone of either crime.

The largely Catholic country also lagged behind other European countries for other to landmark legislation in women's rights. Women could not vote in San Marino until 1960 and divorce was not legalized until 1986.

The San Marino Women's Union created the original petition to overturn the abortion ban, and its president Karen Pruccoli told AFP that this vote was ""a victory for all the women of San Marino, over the conservatives and reactionaries, who believe women have no rights.

""It's a victory against the Catholic Church, who were our opponents and tried everything to prevent this result.""

Malta, Andorra and the Vatican are the only European states with a complete ban on the procedure, although Poland introduced an almost total ban on abortions earlier this year.

San Marino's government has six months to write the legislation to legalize the procedure before it goes to parliament."

Europe's center-left leaders were quick to praise the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) after it squeezed into first place in the country's legislative elections.

Following years of decline, center-left parties like the SPD have been resurgent recently. They are now in power – often with the support of more hardline left-wing parties – in Portugal, Spain, Denmark, Finland, Sweden, and Norway.

Green priorities

In a sign that the SPD will most likely form a coalition with the Green Party that came in third at the election, center-left leaders cited the climate as a welcome priority for the next government.

The Athens Geodynamic Institute said the quake's magnitude reached 5.8 and its epicentre was 23 kilometers (14 miles) northwest of Arvi in southeastern Crete, at a depth of 10 kilometers. Anything between magnitude 5 and 6 is described as a moderate earthquake by most seismologist groups and should be monitored for further shocks.

Olaf Scholz, the chancellor candidate for the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD) in Germany's Sunday general election, hailed a ""great success"" for his party after projections showed his party overtaking the conservatives. ""It's going to be a long election night, that's for sure,"" Scholz said.

The CDU chancellor candidate Armin Laschet said his party could not be satisfied with the results of the election but that he would do everything possible to build a conservative-led government. ""We cannot be satisfied with the results of the election,"" Laschet told his supporters after first projected results put his conservative bloc a whisker behind the Social Democrats. Subsequent projections showed the gap widening. ""We will do everything possible to build a conservative-led government because Germans now need a future coalition that modernises our country,"" he said.

Leaders of Alternative for Germany (AfD) put on a brave face after projected election results showed support for the far-right party dropping and said they rejoiced in seeing Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives slump to their worst-ever result. The mood was subdued at a restaurant in Berlin where party leaders and a few dozen members had gathered after the party failed to improve on the 12.6 percent it secured four years ago, settling instead around 10 or 11 percent.

1120,Battle for German chancellor begins after Scholz's election victory,"00:43

Olaf Scholz will start negotiations to build a coalition that would allow him to replace Angela Merkel as German chancellor after preliminary results showed him edging out her party in a tightly fought election. Figures released by the national election commission showed Scholz's center-left Social Democratic Party (SPD) overtaking the outgoing Merkel's Christian Social Democrats and their Christian Social Union sister party (CDU/CSU) with just over a quarter of the vote. Scholz described the results as a ""mandate"" for his party that indicates German voters are looking for a change. ""This is a mandate to ensure that everything that was discussed in this election and that we have proposed is also implemented,"" he said to supporters on Sunday evening. He will need to negotiate a coalition to secure a majority in the Bundestag, with CDU rival Armin Laschet attempting simultaneously to do the same. The Greens appear to have gained around 51 seats while the free-market Free Democratic Party (FDP) were placed a little over 11%, meaning the two together could likely form a majority government with either of the frontrunners.

The most obvious combination now would be for the SDP to seek a deal with the Greens and FDP because The Left party do not have enough seats to replace either in a majority government. All of the major parties have ruled out working with the far right Alternative for Germany (AfD). This would be the first three-way coalition in modern German history and the negotiations are therefore expected to take weeks or months. On behalf of the CDU, which has led Germany since 2006, secretary Paul Ziemiak admitted that the ""losses are bitter compared to the last election."" And, speaking after the polls closed, Laschet thanked Merkel for her support but lamented the ""difficult"" election fight with a retiring incumbent. He pointed out that the chancellor need not come from the biggest party, but simply needs a majority in the country's parliament. Merkel will continue her 16-year occupation of Germany's top job until the Bundestag agrees on her successor. As well as retiring as chancellor, she did not run for the constituency seat she has held since 1990 this time around. In a symbolic blow, her party lost it to the SDP.

1121,"""This is a very important day"" Germany's voters tell CGTN Europe","A steady stream of new and experienced voters entered the Farinelli elementary school in Munich's trendy Schwabing district on Sunday.

All of Germany's 88,000 polling stations opened at 8am sharp, with some Germans eager to place their votes early in what is being seen as an historic election for the country. It is the first time in 16 years the country will elect a new chancellor.

The ballots ask Germans to cast two votes, one for a candidate in their constituency and one for a political party, of which there are 47. But only a few parties are expected to make it past the 5 percent threshold to enter parliament.

The winners will make up the 598 seats of Germany's next ""Bundestag,"" or parliament. No single party is expected to win a majority, so the party with the most votes will need to negotiate with smaller parties in order to form a coalition.

That coalition will become the next government and vote for the country's new chancellor to replace long-standing Angela Merkel.

1122,Rome's famed river Tiber at risk according to local climate groups,"02:21

Environmental groups are calling for urgent action to clean-up Rome's River Tiber, after thousands of fish were found washed-up on the riverbanks. The Tiber is the longest river in central Italy. It divides the Italian capital in two, and demonstrates the two sides of the capital - the divine and the degraded. Giulio Bendandi has worked on the river for 40 years and described a story of neglect. ""It has been dormant all these years, they haven't done anything. It is abandoned.""

Mario Messina opened a restaurant on the Roman river 12 years ago, but said it's become a bittersweet location to do business. ""It is difficult with the floods but also with the pollution, often bulky waste like fridges passes by and it is not nice at all for the people dining here."" Consequently, many animals that call the river home are struggling to survive. This month thousands of fish were found washed up on the riverbanks and in the coastal town of Fiumicino, where the Tiber joins the Tyrrhenian Sea. It raised fresh concerns about chemical dumps and pollution. However, Italy's Regional Environmental Protection Agency told CGTN Europe the river is constantly monitored and that there has been no deterioration of the water quality. The agency says the fish died after a downpour of heavy rain, which swept street waste into the water and momentarily restricted oxygen.

Elouafi says policymakers need to look at how innovation functions in the private sector if they want to improve the situation.

""Taking the information up to the farmer has always been difficult. We saw a lot of innovations that were created by universities or other public institutions, but never made it to the ground. On the contrary, with the private sector, you really see that flow of innovation working very well. And it's because of the business model of the private sector,"" she said."

Restaurants can stay open until 2 am, while nightclubs and bars don't have to close before 6 in the morning.

Germany went to the polls on Sunday in a national election to determine Angela Merkel's successor. A whopping 40 percent of the German voters said they were undecided before the elections officially began. And opinion polls suggest a close race between the center-left Social Democrats [SPD] and Merkel's CDU-CSU conservative alliance.

Current polls suggest that the CDU-CSU alliance will gain 23 percent of votes and the SPD will receive 25 percent, but the actual outcome is still uncertain. Both parties are expected to fall short of a majority, meaning that despite today's elections, voters can look forward to months of coalition negotiations before Merkel's successor is decided. The Green party, which started strong earlier this year, is polling at only 17 percent of the vote, but either the CDU-CSU alliance or the SPD could ally with them depending on who is on top. Until then, the three main candidates - Olaf Scholz, Armin Laschet and Annalena Baerbock- have cast their ballots along with some of the country's 60.4 million eligible voters.

Olaf Scholz Olaf Scholz is a candidate for the centre-left SPD who painted himself as the successor of Merkel despite not being a member of her party. He has been called ""Scholzomat"" for his robotic speeches and is not the most charismatic candidate to hit the trail. However, unlike his peers, he has avoided campaign scandal and has quickly become one of the favorites in the election. He served as vice-chancellor and finance minister under Merkel, and he sported her famous ""rhombus"" hand gesture in a magazine photoshoot, further aligning himself with her. Scholz's party is left of Merkel's, and he has backed some of their policies, including an increase in the minimum wage and a wealth tax. He cast his vote in Potsdam, his constituency.

He was criticized for being seen laughing during a tribute to the victims of recent flooding in North Rhine-Westphalia, where he serves as the regional leader. He has also been criticized for his response to the pandemic. Despite this, his party is still trailing the SPD in what is appearing to be a close race. He cast his ballot in Aachen, his hometown.

Annalena Baerbock Annalena Baerbock is the 40-year-old candidate for the Green party. She started her campaign among raised fears around climate change, which gave her a strong advantage. Her party wants to decrease the country's timeline to ban coal production from 2038 to 2030. Baerbock has proven popular among young voters. And because of this, the Green party could double their percentage score from the previous election four years ago from 8.9 percent to 17 percent. But she has fallen short of the expected win for the top post, caused in part because of her inexperience and a plagiarism scandal. She cast her vote in Potsdam.

1127,The quest for gender parity,"Indeed, gender inequality in the workplace costs the economies of the world's developing countries an estimated 9 trillion dollars a year. So, what can be done to close that gap? Ameenah Gurib-Fakim, eminent scientist and former President of Mauritius joins Stephen to give her forthright take on a global crisis.

There is some debate over the exact figures - but what is clear is that the majority of the world's poor are women. Women are more likely than men to be out of the labour market doing unpaid care work - and when they do have jobs they are more likely to work for low wages in informal roles.

She has participated in several consultation meetings on environmental issues organized by international organisations such as the World Bank, SIDA, CIDA, EU and UN amongst others. Between 2011 and 2013, she was elected and served as Chairperson of the International Council for Scientific Union – Regional Office for Africa.

Since 2001, she has served successively as Dean of the Faculty of Science and Pro Vice Chancellor (2004-2010). She has also worked at the Mauritius Research Council as Manager for Research (1995-1997).

Ameenah Gurib-Fakim was the first female president of Mauritius, serving from 2015 to 2018. Prior to the presidency, she was the Managing Director of the Centre International de Développement Pharmaceutique (CIDP) Research and Innovation as well as Professor of Organic Chemistry with an endowed chair at the University of Mauritius.

WHAT DOES GURIB-FAKIM SAY?

The message from Ameenah Gurib-Fakim is clear: ""We need more empowerment: more empowerment of young people because Africa is the youngest continent, more empowerment of women because women feed Africa. So, we need to make sure that she has access to capital, she has access to technology, she has access to information because she can really push this sector forward and, of course, reduce poverty.""

She goes on: ""For any economy to prosper, we need to factor in the female component. We need to factor in female ingenuity not because it is an ethical thing to do or a moral thing to do [but because] it makes economic sense.""

She tells Stephen, education is the key – and a key lesson the world can learn from her country. ""My country lead by example. We made education free in 1976. And when that happened, parents no longer had to feel they were making an economic sacrifice by educating the girls because it didn't make economic sense to educate the girls, because the culture is such that she would be married off and leave the family and the boy had to have priority. So that was a game changer.""

But, she says – there is a paradox at the heart of the drive to empower women across the world: ""The worst enemies to women are women themselves. So the message I have for them is that when a woman is out there, let us make sure that we as a community of women, we strive to leave her there for as long as possible, because when she's out there shining, she becomes a beacon and a message and of course, a very powerful role model for others to rise in the younger generations to rise. So let us all take each other by the hand and rise together.""

And she has some tough words for the world if we are ever truly to win the war against poverty: “The chasm which is separating the haves and have-nots is getting bigger and wider."" She tells Stephen: ""But still, I think measures are being taken. But we need less philanthropy, and more taxes. People have to learn to pay. Until that leadership comes on board and takes the bull by the horns. We will still be having this conversation 10 years down the line."""

Iceland's ruling left-right coalition strengthened its majority after a national election that for the first time saw more women than men elected to parliament, final results showed on Sunday.

Opinion polls had forecast the coalition would fall short of a majority but a surge in support for the centre-right Progressive Party, which won five more seats than in 2017, pushed its total count to 37 seats in the 63-seat parliament Althing, according to state broadcaster RUV.

The current government, which consists of Prime Minister Katrin Jakobsdottir's Left-Green Movement, the conservative Independence Party and the centrist-agrarian Progressive Party, said before the election that they would negotiate continued cooperation if they held their majority.

Voters in Iceland elected 33 women to parliament, up from 24 in the last election. Iceland was ranked the most gender-equal country in the world for the 12th year running in a World Economic Forum (WEF) report released in March.

The Progressive Party is led by Sigurdur Ingi Johannsson, who served as prime minister for less than a year in 2016, when former prime minister and then-party leader Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson stepped down following Panama Paper leaks.

President Gudni Johannesson has yet to officially hand a mandate to the party that will be tasked with forming the next government.

The conservative Independence Party again became the biggest in parliament with nearly a quarter of votes and 16 seats, unchanged from the last election.

The Left-Green Movement got eight seats, down from eleven in the 2017 election, although two parliamentarians left the party shortly after the last election."

• Meghan Markle and Prince Harry spoke about vaccine inequality at the Global Citizen Festival in New York. Markle told the crowd of 60,000 that while the world had produced enough jabs to vaccinate 70 percent of every country, the doses have mostly gone to 10 wealthy nations. The festival aimed to combat climate change and urged rich countries to redistribute 1 billion doses. Other concerts will be held around the world, including in Paris and Los Angeles.

• French president Emmanuel Macron announced that his country will donate 120 million doses to other countries, doubling a previous promise. He added that it was an ""injustice"" that poorer nations were behind richer countries and that only around 3 percent of people in Africa have been vaccinated.

• Dolce & Gabbana's fashion show was one of the final events of Milan Fashion Week. They lit up their show with a disco-like atmosphere meant to symbolize a call to leave the darkness of the pandemic behind

• Greta Thunberg visited a controversial coal mine in western Germany on Saturday. Local villagers are protesting the mine owned by the energy company RWE because of its reported plan to cut down trees. The Swedish climate activist was in Germany for Friday's climate strike, the largest since the pandemic began.

• Hundreds of protesters marched against ""corona passes"" in The Hague, Netherlands. The country just implemented a requirement that people show proof of vaccinations to restaurants, bars, theatres before entering. The rule comes as most other measures are being lifted in the Netherlands. Other European countries have also created a similar requirement. The new rule is opposed by the hospitality sector, with one survey suggesting that around 40 percent of bar and restaurant owners will not ask for proof of vaccination.

• Russian president Vladimir Putin spent the weekend fishing and hiking in Siberia after going into isolation in the middle of September because a couple of members of his close circle tested positive. The Kremlin published pictures of Putin on his vacation, including shots of him standing next to a river.

• Russia reported 22,498 new cases and 805 deaths in the past 24 hours. In Moscow, the number of cases jumped by 25 percent last week compared to figures from September 11 to 17.

1130,Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou arrives in China after release by Canada,"Meng Wanzhou received a hero's welcome on her return to China, after fighting extradition to the U.S. for almost three years. Huawei's Chief Financial Officer and daughter of the company's founder was finally released and allowed to return home.

“Finally I came back home.” Ms. Meng told the cheering, flag waving crowd of well-wishers at China's Shenzhen airport as she stepped down from the chartered Air China flight from Vancouver

“After suffering for more than 1,000 days, I'm finally back to my motherland. The long wait overseas was full of struggles. But after I stepped down from the aeroplane, I can feel the exciting warmth of my homeland.” She added.

Meng Wanzhou was detained at Vancouver airport in December 2018 after a warrant was issued by the United States for a range of charges, linked to alleged breaches of sanctions against Iran.

It became a major international incident, souring relations between China, Canada and the U.S.

She was held under house arrest at her house in Vancouver, allowed out during the day wearing an electronic ankle tag.

The global telecoms giant Huawei has been the subject of a US trade embargo on national security grounds. Several other countries including Britain and Australia have followed suit. China claims the ban is really about fear of its technological advances and trade advantages.

Meng Wanzhou's release was confirmed during a court appearance on Friday.

It started with a video link to a U.S. court where she pleaded not guilty but agreed that she had made false statements regarding a fraud case.

With the extradition request dropped, a Canadian judge then ruled that she was free to return to China.

There were emotional scenes outside the courthouse, where Ms. Meng thanked everyone who had supported her, then spoke of its impact it had had on her life.

“Over the past three years, my life has been turned upside down. It was a disruptive time for me. As a mother, a wife and company executive. But I believe every cloud has a silver lining. It really was an invaluable experience in my life,” she said.

Her Canadian lawyer, Richard Kurland, said it had been a politically motivated case all along.

""The Americans never should have started this case in the first place. President Trump used Miss Meng as a trade pawn in negotiations with China wrongfully.” Mr. Kurland said outside the court.

In a simultaneous move, two Canadians who had been arrested on spying charges around the same time were also set free and allowed to return home.

Under the terms of Meng Wanzhou's release, she has until the end of next year to meet the conditions set by the court, at which point the US will drop the threat of prosecution altogether.

The hope now is that tensions could finally start to ease between China, the US and Canada."

Iceland is heading to the polls for an election that could see nine out of ten political parties winning seats in the parliament, potentially making it harder for the future government to find common ground on pressing issues such as climate change. Above all else, climate change was at the top of the agenda during the campaign trail, with some parties trying to take more urgent action and others claiming that Iceland could stand to benefit from it. Many left-leaning parties campaigned on promises to cut the country's carbon emissions further than previously agreed under the Paris Climate Agreement. Iceland already has an aggressive climate change policy compared to other European countries. It plans on being carbon neutral by 2040, a decade before its peers.

However, some parties announced plans that were previously unheard of before the election. The Socialist Party is offering anyone who wants it a job planting trees. The Pirate Party wants to encourage plant-based diets. And Vidreisn, a center-right party, said it would declare a climate emergency if it won. This is because Iceland is increasingly feeling the effects of climate change. This past summer, between June and August, the country saw 59 days above 20 degrees Celsius. It has also seen a dramatic decrease in glacial cover, around 800 sq km melted over the past 20 years. That's around the size of New York City. However, not everyone thinks that these changes will necessarily be a bad thing for the country. The state-owned national energy company said that its water capacity for its hydro-dams increased by around 8 percent because of melting glaciers. And an Icelandic farmer named Hermann Gunnarsson told AP that this year's harvest was the best he has ever had. ""The climate coin has two sides,"" he said. ""But the politicians who talk the most about climate change are afraid to speak about the benefits, too.""

And while three of the nine parties running have pledged to stop the construction of new energy plants in the country, David Gunnlaugsson, head of the center right party Midflokkurinn Sigmundur, argued that it's better to produce energy domestically because Iceland uses renewable energy. ""More production in Iceland is good for the planet and will at the same time improve our standards of living,"" he said. The coming election could also see an end to stability after the country went to the polls five times during the decade before 2017 when the current coalition government took power. After that election, the government was run by an unprecedented partnership between the Left-Green Movement, the center-right Progressive Party and the pro-business Independence Party. And while the head of the coalition, Prime Minister Katrín Jakobsdóttir, has largely been popular since she took power, she may not win another term as her party, the Left-Green Movement, is currently trailing in the polls. It is only expected to gain 10 to 12 percent of the vote on Saturday. The polls will close on Saturday at 10:00 pm GMT.

Britain is expected to announce plans to issue temporary visas to truck drivers to alleviate an acute labour shortage that has led to fuel rationing at some filling stations and warnings from retailers.

As queues started forming outside filling stations early on Saturday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson's office said it was looking at temporary measures to address the shortage of heavy goods vehicle (HGV) drivers.

Newspapers reported that the government would allow up to 5,000 foreign drivers into Britain on short-term visas, a measure that logistics companies and retailers have demanded for months but which the government had previously ruled out.

The UK's Road Haulage Association (RHA) says Britain needs 100,000 more drivers if it is to meet demand. The driver shortage has been caused partly by Brexit and COVID-19, and the loss of about a year of driver training and testing.

""We're looking at temporary measures to avoid any immediate problems, but any measures we introduce will be very strictly time limited,"" a spokeswoman for Johnson's Downing Street office said in a statement.

Downing Street declined to give further details.

Ministers have cautioned against panic buying, and oil companies say there is no shortage of supplies, merely problems delivering the fuel to the gas stations.

However, long lines of vehicles began gathering at petrol stations to fill up after BP said it had to close some of its outlets due to the driver shortages."
1133,Auf Wiedersehen: Angela Merkel bows out after 16 years in office,"04:57

After 16 years in office, Chancellor Angela Merkel is calling it a day. The 67-year-old German Chancellor's decision to retire has left a fresh field of new candidates hoping to succeed her. As Germany's 60.4 million eligible voters prepare to elect a new government, many are also reflecting on the legacy of the country's first female Chancellor, who leaves office with high approval ratings.

Her leadership at home has, in many ways, been characterized by a calm and cautious approach to governing, avoiding populist platforms and personality-driven politics. But looking back she has also faced challenges, including internationally. The 2008 Greek Debt crisis and 2015 Syrian migrant emergency strained her standing in Europe and with many voters at home.

01:46

The migrant crisis became a notable flashpoint in Merkel's leadership after she decided to welcome hundreds of thousands of refugees fleeing the Syrian civil war. It was a decision that proved controversial and helped see the anti-immigrant AfD party win seats during the 2017 election. It was the first time a far-right party managed to enter Parliament in modern Germany's history. Merkel very publicly stood by her decision and pushed back against criticism. ""Let me simply say that Germany is a strong country, and our intention must be to say: We have achieved so much, we will manage this. We can manage this and where there is an obstacle, we have to overcome it,"" she said in 2015. And while many long-term leaders look to use their final years in office to finesse their legacy, Merkel was faced with the unexpected shock of the COVID-19 pandemic, which dominated the final 18 months of her term. ""It's serious. Take it seriously. Not since German unity, no, not since World War II has there been a challenge to our country where it depends so much on our acting together in solidarity,"" she said in a televised address to the nation at the beginning of the crisis.

German voters will head to the polls on Sunday for a national election that will reshuffle power in the Bundestag (parliament) and leave the country with a new Chancellor. For the first time in 16 years, Angela Merkel isn't standing in the election and will retire once a new government is formed. A contentious campaign to replace her has been underway for much of the summer, after a quiet spring that was marked by COVID-19 lockdown restrictions.

Who's vying to be Germany's next Chancellor? Polling suggests that three candidates have a shot at becoming the nation's next Chancellor. Leading in the polls is Olaf Scholz of the left-leaning Social Democrats (SPD). Scholz is regarded as a dry, but stable leader of Germany's Finance Ministry. He's cast himself as Merkel's heir on the campaign trail. However, that title is up for debate. The Chancellor has not endorsed him and has publicly campaigned with her own party, the Christian Democrats (CDU). It has put forward North-Rhine Westphalia premier and party head Armin Laschet to lead the next Government, if victorious. Laschet has struggled to command the same likability with voters as Merkel has. Polling third place after weeks at the top in Spring 2021 is the Greens. For the first time in the party's history, it has named a candidate for Chancellorship, party co-leader Annalena Baerbock.

What do the polls say? It's increasingly looking like SPD candidate Olaf Scholz will be at the head of Germany's next government, according to polls published over the last few weeks. The latest polling from Friday has kept him ahead of Armin Laschet, though the CDU has seen a slight uptick in support. However, some surveys suggest that as many as four in ten voters are still undecided which would be more than enough to erase any comfortable early polling lead.

1138,"UK gas stations close amid driver shortage, prompting fuel fears","Exxon-Mobil's Esso said some of its filling stations that operate alongside Tesco supermarket stores were affected too.

Things seemed to operating normally at a BP petrol station in west London visited by CGTN Europe on Friday. However, the firm said up to 100 of its 1,200 UK forecourts were missing at least one grade of fuel – forcing a handful to close.

The UK government has vowed to ""move heaven and earth"" to resolve a lack of delivery drivers that is forcing some petrol stations to close, with the prime minister reportedly asking minister to relax visa rules. Supply chain disruption and chronic labor shortages have prompted the UK's central bank to warn of spiralling living costs this winter.

But Transport Minister Grant Shapps insisted there is no shortage of fuel supplies, and that the lack of truckers is due to the bottleneck in approving new drivers – with some 40,000 unable to take their tests, as centers are closed because of the pandemic.

""What we're doing is moving heaven and earth,"" the minister claimed.

""I have already introduced legislation, which has helped double the number of available testing slots from pre-pandemic levels,"" said Shapps. ""So we're getting those drivers tested and through and they're joining the marketplace. And of course, they're doing so on significantly better salaries as well. So wages have gone up and that's bringing more drivers back into the market again,"" he added.

Industry group the Road Haulage Association, has accused ministers of ""government by inertia"" – saying the situation had been allowed to get gradually worse before action was taken.

Media reports suggest the Prime Minister Boris Johnson has given the go-ahead for UK immigration rules to be relaxed to allow more foreign truck drivers into the country to ease shortages at petrol stations and other supply chains which have been hit by Brexit.

But with the wholesale gas price hike sending energy companies under, affecting more than a million consumers, and inflation set to soar four percent, according to the Bank of England, there’s a sense Britain’s economic recovery from the Covid pandemic could soon be running on empty.

Countries including the U.S., Australia and the UK have been taking an increasingly hard line towards China, imposing sanctions on organizations and officials accused of facilitating human rights abuses in the Xinjiang region. China says the measures are unjustified and that claims of forced labor, arbitrary imprisonment and even genocide of the ethnic Uygur people are based on disinformation.

Many soccer players in Europe earn millions each year, and Forbes has tracked their incomes to rank the highest earners.

Not only does the table account for the salaries the players earn from the clubs they play for - it also counts how much cash the sportsmen (and they are all men) earn from other sponsors.

These are called ""endorsements"" and come from companies that want the popular players to be seen wearing or using their products.

Some endorsements are directly related to their work, like the boots or accessories they play with. But others sources of revenue include modeling and social media paid-for posts.

According to magazine France Football the highest paid female soccer player in 2020 was Carli Lloyd. The U.S. international, who plays her club soccer at Gotham FC in New York ,is paid a salary of $518,000 a year .

1144,Is the Germany-China car market increasing cooperation or competition?,"""China is the biggest automotive market in the world and it's the most important market for us,"" he added.

""Chinese customers are tech-savvy, they're smart, they know what they want. It's also a bellwether for us where technology is going,"" Daimler's CEO Ola Källenius told CGTN Europe.

In 2020, more than one in three German-made cars were sold in China. Brands like BMW and Mercedes are increasingly focused on appealing to China's growing population of affluent consumers.

China has become a lifeline for Germany's top automakers as profits in Europe have slumped. During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, third-quarter sales from China offset major losses in Europe and North America.

The auto industry is at the heart of the German economy - but in recent years, brands like BMW and Volkswagen have become more focused on sales in Shanghai than Stuttgart.

However, success abroad has been met with ambivalence at home. Some economists fear the current relationship is not sustainable in the long term.

That's because China is also investing billions into homemade, high-tech car brands to compete. Any dip in the two nations' trading ties could put German automakers at risk, market analysts said.

""At the very top level of the management, I think there's much concern about the role China plays and the future competitors that will come from China producing [its own] cars,"" said Juergen Pieper, an auto industry analyst at Bankhaus Metzler.

""This is not very important in the next two or three years, but it's very important for the second half of the decade,"" he explained.

Chancellor Angela Merkel pushed to strengthen German-Chinese business cooperation during her four terms as Chancellor. She told lawmakers that common trade and investment commitments would help align the two nations.

Her state visits often included tours of the dozens of factories for German brands like Volkswagen operating across China. In her last year in office, Merkel changed her tune and urged German companies to look to other markets to minimize risk.

""Around three-quarters of our Asia exports go to East Asia. Half to China alone. In view of this, there are still many opportunities for diversification and the development of additional markets throughout the Asia-Pacific region,"" Merkel said at a business conference in October 2020.

The future of auto industry cooperation will depend significantly on the composition of the next government in Germany.

Left-leaning parties have called for a reassessment of Germany's ties with China, with some threatening to put business deals on the back burner while other sensitive issues are discussed."

""This will ensure customers know tips are going in full to workers and not businesses, ensuring workers receive a fair day's pay for a fair day's work,"" said the UK's Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy.

Restaurant, cafe and pub owners in the UK will be banned by law from keeping customer tips and not passing them on to their employees under new legislation unveiled by the government on Friday.

Cash tips are already legally the property of staff, but the same level of legal protection did not cover tips made by bank card.

The ban was first proposed five years ago, but has recently become more urgent after reports of some companies keeping part or all of the discretionary service charge intended to replace tips as card payments disrupted traditional tipping practices.

Conservative MP and Labor Markets Minister Paul Scully said on Tuesday that, ""Unfortunately, some companies choose to withhold cash from hardworking staff who have been tipped by customers as a reward for good service.

""Our plans will make this illegal and ensure tips will go to those who worked for it,"" he added.

Workers will welcome the new law after the hospitality sector was hit hard by the pandemic. According to the Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy, ""the move is set to help around 2 million people working in one of the 190,000 businesses across the hospitality, leisure and services sectors, where tipping is commonplace and can make up a large part of their income.""

Breaching of the rule might lead to compensation for the worker and the paying of a fine for bosses, but it relies on employees taking the issue to an employment tribunal.

Under the new legislation, the government also plans to introduce a code of practice, which should set out exactly how tips are to be distributed fairly among staff."
1146,"Technology threatens to 'worsen inequality,' says UNESCO chair","While technological innovation could play a key role in reversing the setbacks suffered in the recent past, it also threatens to widen existing divides.

The number of people living in extreme poverty fell from 36 percent in 1990, to 10 percent in 2015. But global progress has suffered a setback. The fallout from the pandemic has compounded the impact of conflict and climate change, which were already slowing progress.

""What we have to do is have creative ways of innovating in the interests of the poorest, of the most marginalized. And digital tech can do that. But we have to ensure that the harms and the challenges it faces, not least to our environment, are mitigated,"" Tim Unwin, UNESCO chair in Information and Communications Technology for Development, told CGTN's Stephen Cole.

Delivering digital connectivity to everyone across the world will be essential to tackling many of the challenges faced by societies, said Mari Pangestu, managing director of development policy and partnerships at the World Bank.

""We are facing a twin crisis, which is the development challenges that were accentuated by COVID-19 - whether it's poverty increasing by a hundred million or the increased inequality that we expect to happen. And we have the climate crisis. We have to make sure that there is digital connectivity, both research and development,"" she said.

The Japanese war orphans adopted in China It is thought that as many as 4,000 Japanese children were adopted by Chinese parents after Japan surrendered at the end of World War II. This is the absorbing story of one 80-year-old who didn't find out her biological parents were Japanese until she was nearly 60 years old. And it also looks at how some of the adopted orphans eventually returned to Japan and have done their bit to build better relations and understanding between the two countries.

TOP HEADLINES

• The World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended the use of Regeneron and Roche's antibody treatment, called Ronapreve or REGEN-COV in the U.S., for patients at high risk of hospitalization and severe illness. The antibody cocktail gained attention when used to treat former U.S. President Donald Trump's last year. It's currently under review by European authorities, while the UK gave it the green light last month and the U.S. has approved it for emergency use. The WHO also called for the company to lower the price of its antibody cocktail and make it available for everyone around the world equitably.

• The pandemic has caused male life expectancy in the UK to drop for the first time in 40 years. According to the Office for National Statistics, a boy born between 2018 and 2020 is expected to live until 79 years old, a drop from the previously estimated 79.2.

• Hundreds took part in unauthorized protests against restrictions, vaccinations and COVID-19 certificates in Bern, Switzerland, on Thursday evening. Similar protests last week led to violent clashes with the police. After a rise in cases in the summer, Switzerland has imposed the mandatory use of COVID-19 certificates, which have been required from September 13 for Swiss residents to access indoor spaces like restaurants, bars and museums.

• Novavax has applied to the WHO to have its vaccine approved for emergency use. The approval could clear the way for the shipping of millions of doses to many poorer countries.

• Portugal will lift all remaining restrictions on October 1, as announced by Prime Minister Antonio Costa on Thursday. That means restaurants and cultural venues will be allowed to welcome guests at full capacity.

• The EU's drug watchdog said it will decide in early October whether to approve boosters of the Pfizer vaccine for those aged over 16. The European Medicines Agency said they will take a decision about administering booster jabs of Pfizer and Moderna for at-risk people and the elderly in the same period.

• A 12-year-old boy in the Netherlands was granted the right to receive the vaccine, which he needed to visit his dying grandmother, despite his father's objections. Children aged 12 to 17 in the Netherlands can choose to be vaccinated but need permission from both parents. In case the parents don't agree, Dutch law says judges can make decisions in the best interests of the children.

• Nobel Prize winners in science and literature will receive their awards in their home countries rather than Sweden because of the uncertainty still posed by the pandemic, organizers announced on Thursday.

• The U.S. Centers for Disease Control has overruled its own health experts' advice, recommending the use of booster jabs not only for Americans aged 65 and older and some adults with underlying medical conditions, but also for workers in high-risk settings.

• Fewer than 4 percent of people in Africa have been fully vaccinated, with most of the doses available in the world having gone to only 10 rich countries. ""It is an indictment on humanity that more than 82 percent of the world's vaccine doses have been acquired by wealthy countries, while less than 1 percent has gone to low-income countries,"" said South Africa's president Cyril Ramaphosa."

Former Catalan President Carles Puidgemont ""must be brought to justice,"" Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said on Friday, as the the exiled politician was released by Italian police in Sardinia.

The 58-year-old's lawyer confirmed, he was free to leave the island but would return for a hearing in October, after spending a night behind bars.

Earlier on Friday thousands had gathered outside the Italian embassy in Barcelona to protest over the arrest of Puigdemont, but Sanchez said the Catalan leader must ""stand trial,"" adding that the Spanish government ""has respect for all judicial proceedings whether opened in Spain, in Europe or in this case in Italy, and will comply with any judicial decisions that may be taken.""

China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi has told the United Nations that ensuring equitable distribution of vaccines, adhering to the Paris Agreement on climate change and tackling poverty are the country's top priorities.

In a statement released by China's Ministry of Foreign affairs following a meeting with Mohamed Shahid, president of the UN General Assembly, Wang called on the member countries and regions to play a more active role in ""the building of a community with a shared future for mankind,"" especially for smaller and poorer nations.

As China and the U.S. both pledged this week to donate funds and vaccines to assist those countries that have struggled to purchase enough doses to inoculate their populations, Wang told the UN: ""China will play a bigger role in promoting international cooperation against COVID-19 and promoting equitable vaccine distribution.""

He also warned against politicizing the origins of the virus and said China would strongly oppose any attempts to do so.

The second point he made to Shahid was that the UN should be a united front on climate change, urging countries to respect the Paris Agreement and find common ground to share the responsibility of tackling this global crisis.

Wang went on to remind Shahid that although China has been successful in tackling poverty in recent decades, it should still hold a ""prominent position"" in global macro-economic thinking.

""China expects more countries to support and join the Global Development Initiative and inject new impetus into the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development,"" said Wang."
1151,Ukraine adopts law limiting oligarchs after assassination attempt,"Ukraine's parliament has passed a law intended to reduce the influence of oligarchs in the country, a day after an attack on a top presidential aide that officials say could have potentially been retaliation for the legislation. Gunmen opened fire on a car carrying President Volodymyr Zelensky's senior aide Sergey Shefir on Wednesday. The new law aims to ""prevent risks to national security linked to the excessive influence"" of oligarchs, according to Ukraine's parliament website.

Zelensky put forward the legislation earlier this year when he announced a new campaign to limit the authority of the country's oligarchs, accusing them of exerting too much control over the economy. ""Ukraine is open to big business but not to the influence of oligarchs on officials, politicians and the media,"" said Zelensky on Twitter. ""Today we took one more step to get rid of that.""

The new law means that individuals recognized as oligarchs will be prohibited from financing political parties and participating in the privatization of large companies. An individual may be classified as an oligarch if three out of four criteria stated by the law are met. These are: beneficial ownership of a monopoly company, significant influence over the media, participation in political activities and a fortune of more than $87 million. The law also means officials must declare any ""contact"" with the person designated as the oligarch.

The legislation was passed in a second and final reading by 279 lawmakers out of a required minimum of 226. People such as Ukraine's richest man Rinat Akhmetov, powerful tycoon Igor Kolomoisky and former President Petro Poroshenko, who is an outspoken critic of Zelensky, could be targeted by the law. However, some analysts doubted the new law will be effective, suggesting the criteria for identifying oligarchs are too vague.

""I don't see how this [law] can in practice undermine the ability of oligarchs to influence the government,"" said Hlib Vyshlinsky, head of the Kyiv-based Centre for Economic Strategy, to AFP. He said the legislation was adopted ""as a card in negotiations to bargain with the oligarchs and not in order to destroy them.""

The vote follows what officials have described as an assassination attempt on presidential aide Sergey Shefir, when more than 10 bullets hit his car during an attack near the village of Lisnyky, south of Kyiv. While Shefir escaped unharmed, his driver was ""seriously injured.""

Zelensky, who was on a visit in the U.S., promised a ""strong response"" to the attack on the 57-year-old former script writer and long-time associate of the president. Police have said they did not rule out the assassination attempt being politically motivated. On Wednesday, national police chief Igor Klymenko said Shefir may have been targeted as part of a bid to pressure Ukraine's top leadership or to destabilize ""the political situation in our country.""

1152,'Demographic crisis': Central European heads make anti-migration stand,"Political leaders from Central and Eastern European have signed a declaration against migration as Europe faces what they call a ""demographic crisis.""

The joint statement from close allies Hungary, Poland, Slovenia, Czechia and Serbia singles out migration as an issue rather than a solution to declining birth rates – and calls on the bloc to keep family policies under national jurisdiction.

It comes as Hungary and Poland face ongoing legal action from the European Union over anti-LGBT+ policies. The governments also share a similar anti-migration stance, with barbed wire fences being built on the border of Poland to stop migrants trying to cross from Belarus. Hungary built a fence on its southern border in 2015.

The conservative leaders met with speakers and academics as part of the fourth Budapest demographic summit on Thursday. The group shared similar concerns that migration is changing demographics on the continent and now they are planning to increase their countries' populations through birth rates rather than taking people in.

Strategies were also shared that they hope will help cement nuclear families and Christian values at the center of government policies. One element several leaders commented on was giving tax breaks to newlyweds and young families – something Hungary says has led to more children being born.

Hungary's right-wing Prime Minister Viktor Orban set the tone for the two-day event, declaring his country vaccinated against ""woke"" thinking. He also defended Hungary's anti LGBT+ law that bans promotion and display of homosexuality and gender change to under-18s. The recent legislation has been widely condemned and criticized for conflating homosexuality with paedophilia."

It is a continuation of the hard line French government officials have taken since they were blindsided by the surprise announcement of the formation of a trilateral security alliance between the three English-speaking Western allies and the scrapping of a contract for France to build submarines for Australia. On September 16, Australia said it was cancelling the French deal in favor of a new contract using U.S. and UK technology and expertise to deliver nuclear-powered submarines. The $40 billion deal signed in 2016 with France to build a fleet of submarines for Australia would have seen French defense firm Naval Group deliver the vessels. On Thursday, the company said it will send Canberra a ""detailed and quantified proposal"" of the ""costs already incurred and to come"" after the breach of the contract for the construction of 12 submarines.



Signs of tensions easing On Wednesday, the American and French presidents finally had a telephone exchange to discuss the crisis. The two main agreements that came out of the call were, firstly, a move to restore France's ambassador to the U.S. to his post in Washington DC, after he and his colleague in Canberra were recalled by the French foreign minister for urgent talks in the wake of the submarine deal collapse.

Russia's navy fired at targets in the Black Sea off the coast of Crimea to test using its Bastion coastal missile defense system, the country's defense ministry said on Thursday. The drills come as neighboring Ukraine held joint military exercises with the U.S., which are set to run until October 1. Russia's Black Sea Fleet practised detecting and destroying sea targets with the mobile anti-ship and surface-to-surface rockets, according to a statement from the defense ministry in Moscow.

Divisions were also shown carrying out strikes with truck-mounted missiles in video footage released by the government. Crews fired from concealed positions using drones to track a simulated group of enemy ships, the statement also stated. Russia's Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu says this Bastion System can hit sea targets at a distance of 350km and land targets as far away as 450km.

Earlier this year, a UK warship was tracked by Russian forces after sailing past the Crimean Peninsula, which Boris Johnson's government claimed are international waters as they, along with the U.S., do not recognize Russia's control of the Donbass region. These latest military exercises come in the same week that Russia, along with China, Belarus and six other countries staged anti-terrorist training at the Donguz training ground in the Orenburg region in what Russia calls Peace Mission 2021. Kyiv said its ""Rapidtrident 2021"" drill, being conducted with U.S. and NATO forces in the west of the country, is due to run until the end of this month.

The European Commission is proposing a standard charger for mobile phones and other electronic devices. By requiring manufacturers to include a specific type of charging port, the Commission says it will save thousands of tons of electronic waste every year. Under the proposed regulations, the USB type C charging port would become universal in the single market for mobile phones and some other electronic devices, such as headphones and digital cameras. ""Chargers power all our most essential electronic devices. With more and more devices, more and more chargers are sold that are not interchangeable or not necessary. We are putting an end to that. With our proposal, European consumers will be able to use a single charger for all their portable electronics – an important step to increase convenience and reduce waste,"" said Thierry Breton, European commissioner for internal markets.

Could Apple be forced to switch? The iPhone manufacturer Apple, which uses its own ""Lightning"" connector, argues that this type of regulation threatens to stifle innovation. However, at a press conference in Brussels announcing the proposal, European officials pushed back against that suggestion. ""No, it's not at all against innovation. By the way, it's not against anyone. It is just, like everything we do and like everything I do as a commissioner and everything we do in the Commission, for the consumer and for the European consumers. It's not against anyone,"" said Breton on Thursday.

Cutting e-waste The European Commission hopes the proposal will help cut electronic waste across the continent. It says unused or discarded chargers make up 11,000 tons of ""e-waste"" every year.

""We gave industry plenty of time to come up with their own solutions, now time is ripe for legislative action for a common charger.

Following criticism of the setup from Western politicians and media, election committee members who are responsible for selecting a majority of Hong Kong's lawmakers and its chief executive, spoke at the invitation of Beijing in an online event on the sidelines of the United Nations Human Rights Council. In April, then UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the changes to restrict election opportunities for ""patriots"" only were a breach of agreements reached when Britain returned the territory to China in 1997. Beijing dismissed the claims, saying the reforms were in the interests of the people and in keeping with the ""One Country, Two Systems"" approach.

""I am not entirely satisfied with the way the federal government has dealt with this,"" said Munich resident Florian Nickel. ""They should have reacted earlier, and more extensively, in the hope that things might have got better.""

Some German voters are angered that their armed forces did not do more to avoid the Taliban takeover and subsequent scramble to get people out of the country.

Only about half of the thousands of local Afghans Germany employed over its 20-year military operation in the country, have been evacuated and it is suspected around 5,000 were left behind, leaving them a potential target for the new Taliban regime.

Today, following the fall of Afghanistan to the Taliban, Berlin has announced it could grant asylum to 10,000 former Afghan staff and their families.

After all, two years prior, Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel had famously welcomed more than a million refugees into the country – a move applauded by the left and which galvanized the right.

For one, it helped propel the far-right Alternative for Deutschland (AfD) into parliament as the largest opposition force.

When asked if Germany should take in the remaining 5,000 Afghans who helped the German army, Munich University student Phillip Kemper answered with a question. ""What else can we do? We are partly to blame for the fact that the Taliban took over again and therefore also to blame that all those people are trying to get out.""

Germany's Foreign Minister Heiko Maas has announced a substantial increase in humanitarian aid to Afghanistan and neighboring countries in an effort to boost stability and thereby keep people from needing to flee.

""Germany has already increased humanitarian funding to Afghanistan and the region by 100 million euros [$117m],"" he said, addressing a donor conference for Afghanistan hosted by the United Nations in Geneva. ""We intend to provide another 500 million euros. [However] The Taliban has to respect basic human rights.""

He added that Germany, along with other NATO member countries, had a ""moral obligation to continue helping the Afghan people.""

But some German voters disagree. Bernhard Zimniok is a member of the AFD and a Member of the European Parliament.

His party is angered by the current CDU/SPD coalition government's readiness to grant asylum to some 10,000 Afghan refugees.

""They pick up everybody,"" he tells CGTN Europe. ""It will not be 10,000. It will be 100,000. Before, 'we have a family' meant, me, my wife, my kids. Nowadays the new explanation includes even their father, their mother: 'I have a brother, his wife, his kids and, and, and...' You pick up one [migrant], you get 30 or 40. Therefore I am really concerned.""

Germany has already taken in more than half a million Afghan refugees in the past few years, far more than the U.S., and has the number of Afghan asylum applications to the country has jumped by 130% since the beginning of the year.

Yet, according to Karsten Fischer from Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, immigration is not really playing a role in this year's election because ""there isn't a refugee crisis. Refugees and migrants are very different things. Migrants want to come because they want a better life, because they want to earn more money and so on. This is legitimate, but it is very different from refugees who just want to survive.""

The chancellor candidate for Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats says Germany ""will welcome anyone who can make a contribution."" While his main rival for the top job, the Social Democrats' Olaf Scholz, believes countries closer to Afghanistan should take on more of the burden of hosting refugees.

One thing is certain, Germany needs more people to sustain its challenged pension system and well-educated, contributing individuals from Afghanistan or wherever could be the ones to help support the country through many elections to come.

France's Naval Group said on Wednesday that it will send a ""detailed and calculated proposal"" to Australia in the coming weeks of the costs it expects Canberra to pay for scrapping a massive contract to purchase French submarines. In 2016, Australia agreed to buy 12 diesel-powered submarines built by Naval Group in a deal praised in local media as the ""contract of the century"" and worth 56 billion euros ($66bn). Despite all the hype, Australia ditched the deal last week in favor of nuclear-powered submarines from the U.S. and Britain, which infuriated Paris and has since sparked a diplomatic row.

France's defense ministry has said talks are already under way between Naval Group and Canberra. Pierre Eric Pommellet, Naval Group CEO told France's Le Figaro newspaper on Wednesday that a bill would be sent to Australia ""in a few weeks."" ""Australia terminated the contract for convenience, which means that we are not at fault,"" Pommellet added. ""It is a case that is planned for in the contract and will require a payment of our costs that were incurred and those to come, linked to demobilization of infrastructure and IT as well as the redeployment of employees. ""We will assert our rights. This decision was announced to us [France] without any prior notice, with unprecedented brutality.""

Previously, Australia had complained that the deal with Naval Group, which is partly owned by the French state, was years behind schedule and over budget. Naval Group had already completed $1.1 billion in work on the submarines, the ministry said, but suffered no losses as the work was covered by payments from Australia. Referring to the pullout as ""a betrayal,"" the defense ministry said the talks would now determine the size of compensation and damages owed by Australia.

On Sunday, Australia defended its decision to ditch the multi-billion-dollar order for French submarines and opt for an alternative deal with the U.S. and UK, saying it had flagged its concerns to Paris months ago. While Australia's Prime Minister Scott Morrison said he understood France's disappointment in response to the order cancellation, he emphasized his focus on always taking decisions in the nation's best interests. ""I don't regret the decision to put Australia's national interest first,"" the leader said. ""This is an issue that had been raised by me directly some months ago and we continued to talk those issues through, including with defense ministers and others.""

1160,Air pollution deadlier than thought: WHO slashes particle guidelines,"The World Health Organization (WHO) has halved its recommended level of tiny particles from burning fossil fuels allowed in the atmosphere, after new evidence has proved air pollution is deadlier than previously thought. It's the first update to the WHO's guidelines on global air pollution in 16 years, after data collected since 2005 has shown bad air is responsible for cutting the average lifespan of the global population by two years – a grim number that increases to up to six years in countries that struggle with severe air pollution, such as India.

The new guidelines recommend lower levels for six pollutants: ozone, sulphur dioxide, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5). The new limit for nitrogen dioxide (NO2), among the most harmful particles, is now 75 percent lower than in 2005. The PM2.5 guideline level has been halved, after evidence has emerged that these particles can enter not only deep into the lungs, but also into the bloodstream, causing mainly cardiovascular and respiratory problems and affecting other organs.

""WHO has adjusted almost all the air quality guideline levels downwards, warning that exceeding the new levels is associated with significant risks to health,"" said the WHO. ""Adhering to them could save millions of lives.""

How harmful is air pollution? At least 7 million people are killed by air pollution every year, according to data collected by the WHO. Recent research estimated that between 2012 and 2018, burning fossil fuels caused 8.7 million premature deaths across the world – including among thousands of children under five years old. Of the total premature deaths related to air pollution: • 27 percent are due to pneumonia • 18 percent are from stroke • 27 percent are from ischemic heart disease • 20 percent are from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease • 8 percent are from lung cancer.

In children, complications from air pollution often cause reduced lung growth and function, respiratory infections and aggravated asthma. Evidence has also emerged since 2005 that air pollution can be linked to other diseases such as diabetes and neurodegenerative conditions. A study from 2019 linked environmental pollution to the increased risk of developing bipolar disorder and depression. The WHO said air pollution, together with the climate crisis, is now one of the biggest environmental threats to human health. The UN body stressed that even sticking to the new guidelines, the global population remains exposed to damaging particles that are always harmful, no matter in what quantity they are present in the air. But if countries will manage to stick to the guideline levels recommended by the WHO, the organization estimates that almost 80 percent of deaths related to air pollution could be avoided. It will be up to each nation to decide whether to comply with WHO's guidelines on air pollution.

What are the main contributors to air pollution in our cities? In 2019, more than 90 percent of the world's population lived in areas where concentrations exceeded the 2005 guidelines for long-term PM2.5 exposure. ""Almost everyone around the world is exposed to unhealthy levels of air pollution,"" said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. ""Inhaling dirty air increases the risk of respiratory diseases like pneumonia, asthma ... and increases the risk of severe COVID-19.""

Air pollution – a mix of particles and gases that are harmful to human health either indoors or outdoors – has several contributing factors that could partly be attributed to modern life. There's a link between the climate crisis and air pollution: most of the pollutants in the atmosphere come from burning fossil fuels for energy and transportation. Historically, the main pollutant in both developed and industrializing countries has been high levels of smoke and sulphur dioxide coming from domestic and industrial use of coal, oil and gasoline. These days, the major contributing factor to air pollution is traffic emissions, especially in urban areas.

The exhaust fumes of cars, planes and all other petrol or diesel-fueled vehicles emit carbon dioxide (the most common of the greenhouse gases present in our air), nitrogen dioxide, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and PM10. Power plants and refineries emit more sulphur dioxide nowadays than volcanoes, which historically were the main emitters of this gas. Other pollutants come from landfills and livestock (methane), using chemical and synthetic cleaning products at home (which emit VOCs) and wildfires. Wildfires, which have devastated California in the U.S., Italy, France, Greece, Spain, Morocco and other places across the world, have not only destroyed hundreds of hectares of land, but they've also released PM2.5 in the air which, colliding with other harmful particles, contributes to smog.

Under the new rules, people who have received two doses of an AstraZeneca, Moderna, Janssen or Pfizer vaccine in the U.S., Australia, New Zealand, South Korea and the EU are considered fully vaccinated and exempt from quarantine, while those who have had two doses of the same vaccines in Latin America, Africa and other countries including India are considered ""not fully vaccinated"" and forced to quarantine for 10 days upon arrival in the UK. Diplomats in Latin America, West Africa and India have described the rules as ""discriminatory"" and ""offensive.""

• Germany will stop paying salary subsidies for unvaccinated workers forced to quarantine after having been in contact with someone who has tested positive or after returning from a high-risk country. The government hopes this move will boost the vaccination campaign, which has so far administered at least one dose of a vaccine to 67 percent of the population.

• Italy has pledged to donate 45 million vaccine doses to other countries by the end of the year – three times its original pledge. ""Nearly half of these have already been delivered and today I am glad to announce that we will triple our efforts. We will donate another 30 million additional doses by the end of the year to reach 45 million,"" announced Prime Minister Mario Draghi during a virtual global COVID-19 summit.

1162,Spain's $3bn plan to tackle high energy prices,"As winter approaches, a crisis over energy prices in Spain is growing.

Following record rises in energy prices, Spanish consumers face some of the most expensive rates on the continent.

Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez's left-wing coalition has decided to intervene. Over the next six months, it intends to transfer just over $3 billion from the energy sector back to consumers. This will be done through a mixture of price caps and tax relief on bills.

Spain's Secretary of State for the European Union (EU) Juan Gonzalez-Barba says this is not just affecting Spain.

""We want a European debate. We want to analyze the causes of the current price fluctuations and which elements of the current law regarding price-setting within the energy market are susceptible and could be improved by using a European approach.""

Spain, like the rest of Europe, is vulnerable to energy price changes. Despite significant efforts to invest in renewable energy, it still relies heavily on fossil fuels and imports 60 percent of its gas from countries including Russia. And as European economies have bounced back from the pandemic, the energy demand is pushing up the prices."
1163,Rehabilitated penguins return to the ocean,"00:44

It's time to go home to the chilly seas of the Atlantic coast for 14 Magellanic penguins after a period of rehabilitation recovering from malnutrition, hypothermia and dehydration at the Mundo Marino Foundation rescue center in San Clemente del Tuyu, Argentina. The penguins waddled down a windswept sandy beach to their freedom after being released by conservationists.

""We found these animals in a state of malnutrition and dehydration,"" biologist Sergio Rodriguez from the foundation told Reuters. ""In some cases they had issues molting, that is the natural replacement of their feathers that had been interrupted for various reasons including lack of nutrients, which means they lacked the feathers to withstand the cold sea waters.""

This lack of plumage meant the penguins had to retreat to the beach because they could not maintain their temperature in the sea. ""They needed to be treated with an adequate balanced diet provided by nutritionists and with a veterinary medical team,"" explained Rodriguez.

There are between 2.2 million and 3.2 million adult Magellanic penguins, mostly found around Argentina and Chile, according to the International Union for Conservation and Natural Resources. The Magellanic penguin was named after Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan. The species is currently listed as being of ""least concern"" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), which means they are not seen as in need of focused conservation.

1165,UK government's plan to subsidize CO2 production will cost 'millions',"Just weeks before world leaders gather in Glasgow to discuss how to cut carbon emissions, the UK government has stepped in with a financial package to encourage a U.S. company to make more of it.

Boris Johnson's government admitted its plan to subsidize Carbon Dioxide (CO2) production during a shortage of natural gas to avert a food supply chain crisis could cost tens of millions of dollars.

CO2 is crucial in the food production industry, including the use of liquid CO2 to keep food cool for transport and to be administered to livestock before they are slaughtered.

But a shortage of natural gas in the UK has caused a knock-on shortage of CO2. Most of the country's industrial supply of the gas is created as a by-product of fertilizer manufacturing, which uses natural gas as a source material.

One of the largest fertilizer firms in the UK, CF Industries, had stopped production because natural gas prices have risen so quickly it's not economical to use the gas to make fertilizer – and therefore CO2.

The UK's Environment Secretary George Eustice announced the government would pay CF Industries to keep its Teesside factory open for three weeks. On Wednesday, Eustice stressed the move was ""temporary"" but confirmed it would cost UK taxpayers ""many millions, possibly the tens of millions"" of dollars.

""There's a lot of turbulence in global supply chains at the moment,"" Eustice added. ""We didn't foresee that these two plants would need to close,"" he told Sky News."
1166,"Outcry over 1,400 killed dolphins forces Faroe Islands to review hunt","The Faroe Islands government is to review regulations governing its centuries-old tradition of hunting dolphins, after graphic footage of the slaughter of a record catch of hundreds prompted an international outcry.

The U.S.-based organization released footage showing people turning the water red as they cut some of the dolphins with knives. It described the hunt as ""brutal.""

But the government of the North Atlantic archipelago said in a statement the latest catch had been ""extraordinary"" due to the size of the pod and it would look into regulations around the practice.

""We take this matter very seriously. Although these hunts are considered sustainable, we will be looking closely at the dolphin hunts and what part they should play in Faroese society,"" Prime Minister Bardur a Steig Nielsen said.

'A bloody affair'

Meat from the hunt is traditionally divided among the islanders.

Hogni Hoydal, leader of the opposition Republican Party and a former fisheries minister who co-created the current whaling legislation, told Reuters he got around 50 kilos of the delicate and lean dolphin meat delivered to him on Monday.

""My claim is that the Faroese whale and dolphin killing, as long as the population is not threatened, is probably the most sustainable use of natural resources that we see in the modern world,"" Hoydal said.

""But I do understand that some react to the number [of slaughtered dolphins] and that it is obviously a bloody affair,"" he added.

Around 4,000 to 5,000 residents have collected their share of the catch, all of which was given away for free, Hoydal said.

The catch on Sunday September 12 was a record, the government said. On average, around 250 dolphins and 600 pilot whales are caught every year in Faroese waters, it added."

The European Commission said it would provide a ""more structured toolbox"" in the coming weeks to help member states deal with skyrocketing energy prices, as concerns mount that high bills could dampen the bloc's COVID-19 recovery. ""In this way, the Commission could help the member states navigate the options available to them,"" said Energy Commissioner Kadri Simson, who was short on details but said Brussels is looking for longer-term solutions to help cut Europe's dependency on imported fossil fuels.

In the immediate term, she said member states could intervene on energy taxes and provide direct support for consumers, without breaking EU regulations.



European gas prices have surged 250 percent this year alone, as energy demand rises post-pandemic, inventories remain low and bad weather in the U.S. disrupts supply.

""It's not ok for our economy, our citizens and we must manage this,"" Jernej Vrtovec, Slovenia's minister of infrastructure said ahead of Wednesday's meeting.

EU lawmakers have also expressed concern that Russia's Gazprom may be manipulating the market, a charge the company has denied. More than 40 members have asked Brussels to investigate.

The impact on consumer power bills has left governments scrambling to offset the costs.

Earlier this month, Spain introduced emergency measures to slash electricity taxes over the winter months, cap natural gas prices and redirect energy company profits back to consumers.

France and Greece are also contemplating a price cap, while Paris said it would give $120 vouchers to poorer households.

Italy is also stumping up cash, as the government warned of a 40 percent rise in retail power prices in the next quarter. The Draghi administration has already spent $1.4 billion and is working on another $3.5 billion intervention to help consumers."
1168,Germany's next chancellor faces big budget choices,"03:10

Carefully balanced finances have long been a sacred principle of the German government. Annual budgets are constitutionally required to follow the philosophy of spending only what you have, while avoiding new debt as much as possible. Yet, the hundreds of billions of dollars in emergency spending stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic has forced Europe's largest economy to re-evaluate its strict debt rules in order to keep the economy alive. Some candidates standing in the Federal Election on Sunday have called for the ""debt brake"" to be axed in order to promote more investment in Germany.

What is the debt brake and why was it suspended? When the pandemic first sent Germany into lockdown in March 2020, lawmakers were quick to vote to suspend the so-called debt brake to cover rising healthcare costs and business support schemes. The debt brake in Germany is one of the strictest fiscal policies in Europe. Its rules limit new budgets to take on no more new debt than the equivalent of 0.35 percent of the national gross domestic product. ""We are obliged to ask the parliament to authorize us to borrow an unusually large sum of money to fight the crisis,"" said Finance Minister Olaf Scholz, who is running to succeed Chancellor Angela Merkel. In the year-and-a-half since the first lockdown began, the finance ministry has reported tax revenues, which would normally cover most of the government's outgoing costs, have declined significantly as businesses feel the impact of reduced economic activity. ""When the crisis hit, the suspension of the debt brake really meant that Germany could run an enormously high fiscal deficit,"" explained Carsten Brzeski, a global analyst at Dutch bank ING. ""We have still an extremely low unemployment rate because all people went under the subsidized furlough schemes. It also has helped companies to survive because the government stepped in to support them,"" he added. WATCH: Carsten Brzeski considers the future of the debt brake

1170,Russia called on to send more gas to Europe before winter,"02:53

The International Energy Agency (IEA) has called on Russia to increase the supply of natural gas to Europe. The IEA's calls will intensify mounting concerns in Western capitals that Moscow has intentionally been restricting exports to help stoke a price spike this winter.

This week, the British government has been scrambling to avert a serious economic crisis that could see dozens of energy companies collapse and leave millions of customers without power. By Tuesday, the chances of that worst-case scenario materializing looked more remote. Ministers have announced a plan to prop up fertilizer production, which relies heavily on gas and a by-product of which – carbon dioxide – is vital for the production and distribution of many food and drink products as well as steel. While officials have ruled out bail-outs for struggling power firms, they are still working on a deal to secure continued supply for customers whose providers do go bust. There had been hope of an announcement by the end of the day.

""There is absolutely no question of the lights going out or people being unable to heat their homes,"" Business Minister Kwasi Kwarteng told parliament on Monday. That Kwarteng even had to say so highlights the gravity of the situation. Analysts say this crisis has not come entirely out of the blue. Jon Guylas, professor of energy, carbon capture and storage at the University of Durham, says Britain's increasing reliance on imports left it vulnerable. ""With gas generated from coal and then with North Sea gas, we've had it good for a long time and we've never really had to be concerned about energy security,"" says Guylas. ""Things are changing.""

Wildfires across the globe, including in Siberia, North America and around the Mediterranean have caused record levels of Carbon Dioxide (CO2) emissions this summer, says the EU's Earth monitoring service. Forests on fire emitted more than 2.5 billion tonnes of CO2, which is equivalent to India's annual emissions from all sources in July and August alone, according to the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service. More than half of CO2 emissions from wildfires came from North America and Siberia.

Heatwaves, drought conditions and reduced soil moisture amplified by global warming contributed to unprecedented fires in three continents. The Arctic Circle, which was also on fire, released some 66 million tonnes of CO2 from June through August, nearly a billion tonnes of which came from Russia. ""What stood out as unusual were the number of fires, the size of the area in which they were burning, their intensity, and also their persistence,"" Mark Parrington, senior scientist and wildfire expert at Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service told AFP.

Why were there so many wildfires during the summer? Fires started raging across northeastern Siberia in June and only started to abate in late August and early September, according to satellite-based monitoring from the service. Emissions from the region during that period were nearly double those of the year before. Even though satellite images do not provide answers to how these fires start, many of the blazes are thought to have been caused by ""zombie"" fires that smoulder through the winter and then reignite. Rising temperatures and increased dryness as a result of changing rainfall patterns create ideal conditions for bush and forest fires.

The World Meteorological Organization has reported that the five-year period to 2020 was ""unprecedented"" for fires, particularly in Europe and North America. In a draft report obtained by AFP, the United Nations' IPCC climate science advisory panel concluded: ""Globally, increases in temperature and aridity have increased the length of fire seasons and doubled potential burnable area.""

Wildfires have ravaged across most areas of the globe in 2021. The western U.S. and Canada's British Columbia posted record temperatures nearing 50 degrees Celsius and massive plumes of smoke from Siberia and North America reached across the Atlantic to parts of Britain and Europe. Persistent heatwaves along the Mediterranean rim worsened uncontrolled wildfires. Turkey's daily fire intensity reached the highest levels ever recorded in a near 20-year dataset and other countries hit by out-of-control blazes included Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Albania, North Macedonia, Algeria and Tunisia.

The Turow mine, which borders Germany and Czechia, has been the subject of a long-running complaint from the Czech government after it recently began expanding further toward the border.

Czechia claims plans to extend the mine threaten the environment and groundwater on its land.

In May, the European Court of Justice ordered mining be immediately halted as an interim measure until a final judgment could be made. Czechia then asked the court to impose a daily penalty of more than $5 million on Poland for not immediately closing the mine.

Czech authorities welcomed Monday's verdict despite the lower penalty.

Morawiecki stood firm Tuesday against the ruling from the EU's top court, telling a press conference: ""This decision is totally wrong ... we do not plan to stop operations of the Turow mine and energy power plant.""

He noted Poland would use ""all legal and any other possibilities"" to fight the decision.

The Polish government argues the Turow mine and nearby power plant are crucial for the country's energy security, supplying as much as 7 percent of Poland's energy output.

The mine, which produces lignite, or ""brown coal,"" has been running for more than a century. It and the nearby power station are part of the PGE Polish Energy Group. In 2020, the company's extraction license was extended at the mine until 2026, it's considered a major source of jobs for the region.

In response to Poland's refusal to comply, a spokesperson for the European Commission said Poland must pay the daily penalties and has a legal obligation to do so.

Another spokesperson said the European Commission wanted Poland to immediately halt operations at Turow and that the EU would use all its powers to ensure the fines imposed by the court were paid.

It was thought a financial penalty might pressure Warsaw to seek a resolution with Prague after bilateral talks began in June around mine upgrades and measures to limit damage to water levels, noise and air conditions.

However, the Polish government has pushed back ever since the ruling, saying the court's penalty undermines the talks.

Monday's order from the European Court of Justice adds to the other issues over which Warsaw is fighting the EU, the majority around rule of law."

Germany has reacted with shock and outrage after a 20-year-old petrol station worker was shot dead by a customer angry about being asked to put on a mask while buying beer.

The killing on Saturday evening in the western town of Idar-Oberstein is believed to be the first in Germany linked to the government's coronavirus rules.

The row started when the cashier, a student, told the customer to put on a face mask, as required in all German shops. After a brief argument, the man left.

The suspect then returned about an hour-and-a-half later, this time wearing a mask. But as he brought his six-pack of beer to the till, he took off the mask and another discussion ensued.

""The perpetrator then pulled out a revolver and shot him straight in the head,"" prosecutor Kai Fuhrmann told reporters on Monday.

The suspect, a 49-year-old German man, walked to a police station the following day to turn himself in. He was arrested and has confessed to the murder.

He told police he felt ""cornered"" by the coronavirus measures, which he perceived as an ""ever-growing infringement on his rights"" and he had seen ""no other way out,"" Fuhrmann said.

Idar-Oberstein mayor Frank Fruehauf called it ""an unfathomable, terrible act,"" and residents have laid flowers and candles outside the petrol station.

'The cruel result of hatred'

The murder comes just days before Germans head to the polls for a general election on September 26 that will see Chancellor Angela Merkel bow out after 16 years.

Katrin Goering-Eckardt, the parliamentary leader of the Green party, tweeted that she was ""deeply shaken"" by the killing, which she said was ""the cruel result of hatred.""

Agriculture Minister Julia Kloeckner from Merkel's center-right CDU party, who comes from the region, said the murder was ""shocking.""

The Tagesspiegel newspaper said far-right chat groups on the Telegram social platform were applauding the murder.

1178,Germany's coal conundrum divides chancellor candidates,"A landmark deal reached between the German government and the country's largest coal companies promised to shut down coal production before 2038, but recently updated climate legislation may require that date to be brought forward significantly to meet new emissions targets.

The revised Climate Action Law will require Germany to become carbon neutral by 2045 and cut greenhouse gas emissions by 65 percent before the end of the decade.

While no candidate eyeing the chancellery has opposed the updated policy or planned phasing out of coal power, party platforms are divided over the timeline to get it all done.

Chancellor Angela Merkel and her CDU successor Armin Laschet have said they are committed to the agreed date set for 2038 and nothing sooner. Meanwhile, the climate-conscious Green party is pushing for a quicker inclusion of more renewable energy sources.

Any changes to the deal could have a major knock-on effect for industrial regions that have been built up around the coal industry. Eastern regions such as Lausitz could face thousands of layoffs and feel an indirect hit to local businesses.

Melanie Zirzow, a coal industry employee, said: ""2038 gives us, let's say, 18 or 19 years to build a new infrastructure accordingly, so that we create opportunities and alternatives for the region."" Adding: ""We need this time. If we get out of coal even earlier, then the problems will only increase.""

Lausitz is home to three active coal mines that dig for lignite, or so-called ""brown coal."" Lignite is one of the dirtiest fossil fuels and has long been in the firing line of climate campaigners.

At present, Germany relies on lignite coal production for 23 percent of electricity needs. Renewable sources, such as solar and wind, account for 33 percent.

While unlikely to be part of the next government, the Alternative for Germany party (AfD) has received growing support from the region in recent elections. Its party platform has called for prioritizing local employment over any urgency to Germany's climate transition.

Parties at the opposite end of the spectrum have voiced similar concerns.

""A structural change requires time – time more than money,"" said Torsten Herbst, a member of parliament from the Free Democrats Party representing the region.

""We need an attractive mix for business investors to invest in new industrial jobs. That means lower business tax, a better digital infrastructure, also faster permits for industrial installations.""

Under the original deal, the German government pledged $47 billion to soften the blow that an end to coal production would likely have on the region – $5 billion of that is destined for utility companies that close plants, while the rest would help finance a major economic transition.

Even with additional funding, skeptics say it may be impossible to switch out of coal sooner than planned. Construction of renewable sources has slowed in recent years and the country doesn't have enough wind farms or solar panels to meet current supply demands.

""Germany sees itself very much as a leader in climate mitigation, but if we look at the last 10 years, we must admit that we've been lagging behind in slowing down,"" said Timon Wehnert, a researcher on energy transitions at the Wupper Institute.

Construction of additional facilities is planned for the next decade, but storing the excess energy for rainy days is likely to pose a problem.

""Every day is not a sunny day in Germany. Every day is not a windy day in Germany. And the storage facilities for these types of energy sources are very low at present,"" he added. ""In the long term, we need to think about the storage question."""

Afghans seeking to escape the Taliban and relocate to the UK have had their details accidentally revealed by the British government.

Earlier this month, the UK, the U.S. and other NATO members scrambled to evacuate their citizens and those who had worked for them after the Taliban gained control of Afghanistan.

UK Defense Secretary Ben Wallace said an email from Britain's Afghan Relocations Assistance Policy – the scheme used to help interpreters and others who had worked for Britain – had compromised more than 250 recipients by including all recipients' email addresses on them, rather than blind-copying the email addresses so recipients could not see who else had been sent the note.

The attack on Skripal, who sold Russian secrets to the UK, caused the most significant row between Moscow and the West since the Cold War, leading to the tit-for-tat expulsion of dozens of diplomats after London pointed the finger of blame at the Kremlin.

Russia has consistently rejected any involvement in the matter, casting the accusations as anti-Russia propaganda.

Skripal and his daughter Yulia were found unconscious on a public bench in the southern English city of Salisbury in March 2018. Along with police officer Nick Bailey, who went to Skripal's house to investigate, they were left seriously ill in hospital from exposure to the military-grade nerve agent.

The three eventually recovered but Salisbury resident Dawn Sturgess died from Novichok poisoning after her partner found a discarded counterfeit perfume bottle, which police believe had contained the poison.

In September 2018, British prosecutors charged two Russians, then identified by the aliases Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov, with conspiracy to murder Skripal and the attempted murder of Yulia and Bailey.

Dean Haydon, the UK's senior national coordinator for counter-terrorism policing, said prosecutors had now authorized them to charge a third man, Sergey Fedotov, who he said is aged about 50, with the same offenses.

Haydon also said Petrov and Boshirov were actually named Alexander Mishkin and Anatoliy Chepiga and that Fedotov's true identity was Denis Sergeev.

Skripal plot

""We can't go into the detail of how, but we have the evidence that links them to the GRU [the Russian federal intelligence agency],"" Haydon told reporters, describing them as highly trained. ""All three of them are dangerous individuals.""

As with the other two Russians, British police had obtained an arrest warrant for Fedotov and they were applying for Interpol notices against him, he said.

All three men are believed to be in Russia, with which Britain has no extradition treaty, and the Russian authorities have so far offered no cooperation, Haydon added.

Litvinenko case

The police announcement comes on the same day the European Court of Human Rights ruled Russia was responsible for the 2006 killing of former KGB officer Alexander Litvinenko, who was poisoned at a London hotel with Polonium 210 – a rare radioactive isotope.

Andrei Lugovoy, one of the men Britain accused of murdering Litvinenko, told Reuters on Tuesday that the ruling was politically motivated.

""I think this decision is absolutely politically motivated,"" Lugovoy told Reuters in an audio message shared by his assistant. ""I am very skeptical about it. I think it is extremely idiotic and damaging to the reputation of the European Court of Human Rights.""

Kremlin critic Litvinenko, 43, died weeks after drinking green tea laced with Polonium-210 at London's Millennium hotel in an attack Britain has long blamed on Moscow."
1182,German elections: How will COVID-19 policy influence voters?,"On Sunday, Germans go to the polls to elect a new government that will then elect a new chancellor to replace the long-standing Angela Merkel.

She has been praised by some for her handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. Compared with other European Union nations, Germany has been applauded for doing relatively well throughout the past 18 months of the pandemic.

A fast response to the initial outbreak, with wide-scale testing, allowed Germany's health care system to manage the rising infection numbers.

And while the economy was hit hard, considerable social services to help those most affected were promised and delivered.



Anti-lockdown divides

However, once federal and state lockdown measures and restrictions on public life were introduced – they were less severe, it should be noted, than other EU nations such as France and Spain – some felt the government's hand was reaching too far into their private lives.

Anti-lockdown, anti-government demonstrations began to occur across the country with protesters blaming politicians for encroaching on their rights and freedoms.

The government has had to tread carefully, constantly reviewing measures that will keep Germans safe and beds in intensive care units open.

To jab or not to jab

Vaccinations are now the dividing issue in German society. With only 63 percent of the population fully vaccinated, Germany's President Frank-Walter Steinmeier blames this on a ""crisis of trust"" between the citizens and the state.

Some political parties, such as the pro-free market Free Democratic Party and the far-right populist Alternative for Germany, have been campaigning on this ""crisis of trust,"" looking to garner more support from people opposed to vaccination.

Forcing people to get vaccinated is a sensitive topic in the country. While a majority agree to stricter rules for the unvaccinated, most don't want them mandated by the government.

""It's your own body,"" says 25-year-old student Nadiesta Kaminski. ""I think you should still leave it to the people because some want to get vaccinated later, as I actually do, just to see more studies, how it works.""

Munich mother Angelika Hofmann says everyone should have their own choice: ""The unvaccinated should have disadvantages, because they now had the opportunity to be vaccinated and the general public cannot always be disadvantaged with all these measures.""

German voter Philip Pappenheim believes in mandating vaccines, arguing that ""it is actually a positive thing because the people who are not vaccinated now are appropriately to blame. They don't do much to help the general public.""

The current ruling coalition government (CDU/CSU and the SPD) will not force inoculations, but are doing all they can to push more people to get the jab.

In August, the 3G rule was introduced across Germany. Now anyone wanting to access a restaurant or cultural space must show proof of a vaccine (geimpft in German), a negative test (getestet) or a recent recovery from COVID-19 (genesen).

The government has also announced it will stop paying for the currently free COVID-19 tests come October.

But what could a new government bring?

Both the chancellor candidates of the CDU, Armin Laschet, and the SPD's Olaf Schulz have said they will not mandate vaccines, however Annalena Bearbok of the Greens says her party will not rule that out.

Yet, with only days to go before Germans decide on the next leaders to take the country forward, the head of Germany's disease control agency, Lothar Wieler, warned that hospitals were filling up with young, unvaccinated people.

""The pandemic is not over yet,"" he cautioned. ""If the vaccination rate in the country doesn't increase drastically, Germany will experience a fulminant wave of new coronavirus infections in the fall.""

The direct impact the pandemic is having on the lives of Germans has fueled varying opinions that will likely play out in the ballot boxes."

The new alliance between the U.S., Australia and the UK, which stripped France of a $40 billion contract for submarines with Canberra, angered Paris and now the European Union is rallying behind its member state. At an EU meeting in Brussels on Tuesday, ambassadors agreed to postpone preparations for an inaugural trade and technology council on September 29 with the U.S. in Pittsburgh. ""One of our member states has been treated in a way that is not acceptable, so we need to know what happened and why,"" said European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. The topic was taken off the meeting's agenda, two EU diplomats told Reuters.

French and German ministers in Brussels have talked about the Australia-UK-US deal, known as AUKUS, as a ""wake-up call"" for Europe to become a stronger independent actor on the global stage. ""It is once again a wake-up call for all of us in the European Union to ask ourselves how we can strengthen our sovereignty, how we can present a united front even on issues relevant to foreign and security policy,"" said Michael Roth, Germany's minister for European affairs. He also talked of the importance for the EU to talk ""with one voice"" and for the need to work together to rebuild what he called ""lost trust"" with its allies. Roth's counterpart in France, European affairs minister Clement Beaune, said he would ensure that the matter is discussed at EU summits and ministerial meetings next month.

France has welcomed the support of EU top officials and ministers, with Beaune saying the row is ""a European issue,"" rather than a French one. ""I don't think France is overreacting,"" he said on Monday, after France had recalled its ambassadors to the U.S. and Australia and French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian accused the U.S. of betrayal and Australia of back-stabbing.

Some EU member states have shown more caution, with Sweden's EU Minister Hans Dahlgren saying: ""I don't think we should restructure the EU's trade policy because of this."" European Council chief Charles Michel told reporters last week, when the deal was revealed, that they observed ""a clear lack of transparency and loyalty"" and that there needed to be ""transparency and trust"" between allies. The EU's top diplomat Josep Borrell said EU foreign ministers meeting in New York ""expressed clear solidarity with France."" The European Commission said on Monday it was looking into delaying negotiations with Australia on Canberra's three-year bid to secure an EU trade deal.

Meanwhile, the U.S. president has requested a meeting with his French counterpart to discuss the crisis. Joe Biden is said to be urgently trying to schedule a call with Emmanuel Macron. President Macron will not be attending the UN General Assembly (UNGA) in person this year and so any such meeting will have to be on the phone or by video. As of Tuesday afternoon, no call had been agreed, although Macron did find time to speak to his Indian counterpart, Narendra Modi, about Indo-Pacific strategy. Macron also has meetings with the Georgian president and the Lebanese prime minister scheduled this week, along with the inauguration of a modern art collection in Paris.



Speaking after a meeting of EU foreign ministers on the sidelines of the UNGA in New York, the France's Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said: ""We thought unilateralism, unpredictability, brutality and not respecting your partner was part of the past but it continues.""



""It's not just about a brutal, unexpected and unexplained breach of a contract,"" said Le Drian. ""What matters now is the breach of trust between partners, because partners in alliance means transparency and predictability. It requires explanations."" The AUKUS pact will supply Australia with at least eight nuclear-powered submarines by 2040. Canberra pulled out of its original contract with France for a dozen attack-class submarines in a deal worth at least $66bn and for which work was already under way. Linked to the announcement was the unveiling by the Australian prime minister, the U.S. president and the British prime minister of a new security arrangement between the three countries, focused on security in the Indo-Pacific region.

The British government is this week being warned that by the end of the year, there may be fewer than 10 left standing.

A surge in global gas prices in recent months means smaller providers will struggle to suck up the extra costs of buying wholesale in a market where the UK regulator, OfGem, enforces a cap on consumer prices. In other words, that extra expense cannot be fully offset by passing it on to consumers.

A plan may be emerging during crisis talks between the government, regulators and energy companies that could see many of them collapse as a result. However Britain's government has made clear it will not bail out failing energy companies.

Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng told lawmakers in parliament: ""The government will not be bailing out failed companies, there will be no rewards for failure or mismanagement, the taxpayer should not be expected to prop up companies that have poor business models.""

To prevent company failures causing the lights to go out up and down the country, the Financial Times is reporting that emergency loans would be offered to larger energy companies that survive, to persuade them to take on otherwise unprofitable customers from those failing providers. Without the promise of state support, where would the incentive be for them to do so?

That is one part of the equation aimed at averting a serious economic crisis.

The other is a shortage of carbon dioxide essential for the production and distribution of, among other things, food, drink and steel. CO2 is sold by major fertilizer producers, which also rely heavily on natural gas in their production processes.

Some have halted operations in the UK on account of high gas prices, meaning both fertilizer and CO2 stocks are running low. The solution may again be more government spending – this time in the form of emergency subsidies, to persuade fertilizer manufacturers to restart production.

It is the kind of extra expenditure the state could do without, having already spent unprecedented sums to support businesses and individuals during the pandemic.

Getting the economy to stand on its own two feet again has become perhaps the main priority for policymakers in recent months, with the end of most domestic coronavirus restrictions in July and more recently an easing of rules for international travel. A major government support scheme for businesses is due to wind down at the end of September.

The hope appears to be that the current shortage will be short-lived and therefore not too taxing on the public purse in the long term. Arriving in New York for a meeting of the United Nations General Assembly, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said immediate action was needed to prevent businesses going bust. ""But this will get better as the market starts to sort itself out as the world economy gets back on its feet,"" Johnson added.

For now, consumers have been spared. The government and companies will absorb the costs. The longer this drags on, the more the pressure will build to pass on some of these higher prices in the form of higher gas bills."

People living in the Netherlands, who measure up as the tallest in the world, are shorter than previous generations, a study has shown.

After the population gained height for decades as living standards and diet improved, researchers found that men born in 2001, at 182.9cm, were a centimetre shorter, on average, than those born in 1980. Women were 1.4cm shorter, at 169.3cm.

The study, conducted in coordination with several public bodies, was based on more than 700,000 individuals who self-reported their height aged 19.

While immigration was cited as one reason for the drop, with families of those moving from abroad generally shorter than Dutch natives, those with no history of immigration were also shorter than their peers were 20 years earlier. Changing diets are considered to be a possible factor.

The Dutch nevertheless remain the tallest people in the world."

On Tuesday, China celebrates the Mid-Autumn Festival. The celebration marks the harvest and is the second most important in China after the new year.

For many it is an opportunity to eat mooncake pastries and reunite with family.

The festival is held on the 15th day of the eighth month of the Chinese lunisolar calendar, corresponding to mid-September to early October of the Gregorian calendar.

Here are five things you might not know about the celebration:

It's 3,000 years old

The Chinese have celebrated the harvest during the autumn full moon since the Shang dynasty, which was founded in 1600 BCE and lasted for 600 years.

The festival started to gain wider popularity during the Tang dynasty (618–907 CE). And, by the time of the Northern Song Dynasty (960-1279 CE), it had become a popular folk festival and the 15th day of the eighth month of the lunar calendar was officially designated as the Mid Autumn Festival.

By the Ming and the proceeding Qing Dynasties, the Mid-Autumn Festival had become one of the main folk festivals in China.

People call it the Moon Festival

The ancient Chinese found the moon is at its fullest in the middle of every lunar month and at its brightest in the middle of autumn. This led to the festival being attached to the full moon.

In ancient China, offerings and sacrifices to the moon were an important social ritual both for emperors and the people. According to researchers, by the time of the Tang Dynasty, sacrifices were replaced by larger entertainment events.

The full moon, in part due to its associations with the festival, embodies feelings of harmony and reunion for many Chinese people."

Poland has vowed to keep its disputed Turow coal mine running, despite being hit with a order to pay a 500,000 euro ($585,550) daily penalty to the European Commission for defying an earlier court ruling to halt operations.

Europe's top court, the Luxembourg-based Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU), ordered the penalty on Monday.

It followed a request from Czechia, which is locked in a dispute with Poland over the Turow open-pit mine that sits next to their shared border. The Czech government says the mine is damaging its communities.

The mine, which produces lignite, or brown coal, has been operating for more than a century, but has recently expanded further towards the Czech border.

The EU penalty could pressure Warsaw to seek a resolution with Prague after bilateral talks started in June over technical upgrades and measures to limit damage to water levels and noise and air conditions. A deal should end any legal disputes.

The Polish government said on Monday the EU court's penalty undermined those talks and said Turow, a major source of jobs and electricity in its region, would continue operations.

""The fine mentioned by the Court of Justice of the European Union is disproportionate to the situation and is not justified by facts,"" Poland's government said in a statement.

""It undermines the ongoing process of reaching an amicable settlement.""

The court's order comes amid other disputes Warsaw faces with the European Union, largely over the rule of law.

Czechia has taken its grievance over Turow to the European Commission, which last year started legal proceedings, saying Warsaw had breached EU law when extending the mine's life.

The country also took its case to the CJEU, and won judges' backing for a temporary order to stop Turow's operations until a final judgment.

'Judicial robbery'

When Warsaw said it would not halt production, Prague asked for a daily penalty payment of 5 million euros ($5.9m) to be levied.

The court on Monday agreed but set the fine much lower.

""Such a measure appears necessary in order to strengthen the effectiveness of the interim measures decided upon in the order of May 21, 2021 and to deter that member state from delaying bringing its conduct into line with that order,"" judges said.

Prague welcomed the penalty but said it still wanted to reach an agreement in an amicable way.

Some Polish officials strongly rejected the order.

""The CJEU demands half a million [euros in] daily fines from Poland for the fact that Poland did not leave its citizens without energy and did not close the mines overnight,"" deputy justice minister Marcin Romanowski said on Twitter.

""It is judicial robbery and theft in broad daylight. You won't get a cent."""
1189,Fears pandemic could delay plans to address child poverty in Europe,"08:40

There are fears that levels of child poverty in Europe could increase further as governments withdraw targeted financial support to families who have suffered during the COVID-19 pandemic. Before COVID-19, nearly 23 percent of all children in the European Union were at risk of poverty or social exclusion. Single-parent households were at the highest risk. It is widely believed the numbers have spiked dramatically during the pandemic as millions lost their jobs and families were hit with a fresh wave of financial hardship. Floods in northern Europe and fires across the south of the continent – in Italy, Greece and Spain – have also had a devastating effect, as families have lost their homes and livelihoods. This means that now nearly one in three children in Europe doesn't have access to adequate food, healthcare, early education, or decent housing.

Nearly a quarter of all children in Europe are at risk of poverty, a chronic issue experts fear could worsen due to the pandemic. Nearly a quarter of all children in Europe are at risk of poverty, a chronic issue experts fear could worsen due to the pandemic.

Food banks demand Across Europe, a record number of people turned to food banks during the pandemic. The Food Bank of Hainaut Occidental in Wallonia, Belgium had to collect three times as much food to meet the growing demand. ""We see the increase and what lies ahead of us is ominous,"" said Jacques Vandenschrik, president of the European Food Banks Federation. ""The increase in food demand for children, adults and seniors is going to be massive."" Vandenschrik fears a dramatic spike in hunger as the financial support governments doled out during the pandemic starts to dry up. ""Before the pandemic, we had this issue and while many people believe that Europe is a fantastic continent where everyone lives in a very decent way, well, it is not true,"" he said. ""There is no privileged country in Europe. Everywhere there is poverty and there is a need for feeding help.""

EU initiative 'not enough' To address the chronic problem of child poverty, the EU launched a new initiative earlier this year called the European Child Guarantee. It is aimed at lifting 5 million children out of poverty by 2023, by providing them with free access to healthcare, housing, and education. But critics say much more is needed if Europe is to really address the 18 million children living in poverty across the bloc. ""It's not ambitious enough, that is clear,"" said Jana Hainsworth, the secretary-general of the child welfare organization Eurochild. ""The money that's coming out of the European Union is just a drop in the ocean, but the political commitment is really important.""

Two new London Underground train stations opened their gates on Monday morning, marking the first major extension to the Tube network this century.

The $1.5bn Northern line extension, which began in 2015 and involved building a 3km tunnel from nearby Kennington, adds Nine Elms and Battersea Power Station to the iconic subterranean transport map in south London.

The extension – completed ahead of schedule and under budget – will help support around 25,000 new jobs and more than 20,000 new homes, with Battersea now a 15-minute direct ride from the City and West End. Trains will run every 10-12 minutes, doubling in frequency next year. Eight million people could eventually use the line.

""This extension will hugely improve the links between these vibrant, growing south London neighborhoods and the rest of the capital, and will also help to support thousands of new jobs and homes as we move forward with London's recovery from the pandemic,"" said Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London.

By 5 a.m., a crowd of more than 100 train enthusiasts had gathered outside Battersea Power Station station – which is the only Tube stop to feature the word ""station"" twice – to become the first passengers on the newly opened extension. Some had traveled from northern England the previous evening to ensure they made a slice of history."

Three people have died after crossing into Poland from Belarus, and a fourth person has been found dead on the Belarusian side of the border following a surge in illegal migration that has caused a diplomatic row. Polish officials, who announced the three fatalities inside Poland, gave no cause of death on Monday. The Belarusian border service identified the person found inside Belarus as ""a woman of non-Slavic appearance"" but did not say how she died. Poland's Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said there had been almost 4,000 attempts to illegally cross Poland's border in September and nearly 7,000 over the past two months and put the blame for the increase in migration on Minsk. ""[Belarus] has introduced a visa-free regime with several countries with great potential for illegal immigration, tens of thousands of people are being brought to Belarus,"" he said.

The European Union has also accused Belarus of encouraging people to cross into Polish territory, many of them from countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan, to put pressure on the bloc over sanctions it has imposed on Minsk. Poland has started building a barbed-wire fence to curb the flow of migrants and has declared a 30-day state of emergency in a 3km-wide strip of land along the frontier. ""There were three people who died unfortunately on the Polish side, as far as we know on the Belarusian side it was one woman,"" Polish border guard chief Tomasz Praga said.

Although he did not say how they died, he said there had been many cases of people being exhausted or suffering from hypothermia after arriving from Belarus and some had been saved from drowning in swamps. The Belarusian border service said ""clear signs of dragging a body from Poland to the Republic of Belarus were recorded"" near the corpse found on the Belarusian side of the frontier. ""This is a lie,"" Praga said. The Belarusian interior ministry declined to comment to Reuters. The Belarusian border service was not immediately available to comment. Praga said 110 people had been detained for allegedly helping organize illegal crossings. A pregnant woman had been detained after crossing the border with 13 children, none of them her own, and the children were admitted to hospital with COVID-19, he said. Interior Minister Mariusz Kaminski said 500 more soldiers would be deployed to help the border guard protect the frontier.

1192,"Homes destroyed, thousands evacuated as Canary Islands volcano erupts","The Canary Islands' first volcanic eruption in 50 years has forced the evacuation of more than 5,000 people, including 500 tourists, and destroyed about 100 houses, officials said on Monday.

The volcano erupted on Sunday, shooting lava hundreds of meters into the air, engulfing houses and forests and sending molten rock towards the Atlantic Ocean over a sparsely populated area of La Palma, the most northwestern island in the Canaries archipelago.

No fatalities have been reported but the volcano was still active on Monday. Pictures showed heavy smoke coming from the volcano and houses burning.

Officials said they were hopeful they would not need to evacuate any more people.

""The lava is moving towards the coast and the damage will be material. According to experts, there are about 17 million to 20 million cubic meters of lava,"" regional president Angel Victor Torres told Cadena Ser radio.

The lava flow has destroyed about 100 houses so far, Mariano Hernandez, president of La Palma's council, told Cadena Ser.

About 20 houses were engulfed in the village of El Paso along with sections of roads, Mayor Sergio Rodriguez told state broadcaster TVE. The lava was spreading through neighboring villages, putting hundreds more at risk, he said.

Tourists evacuated

A group of 360 tourists was evacuated by boat to Tenerife from the beach resort of Puerto Naos, ferry operator Fred Olsen said, and more could be transferred later in the day.

Despite the destruction, Tourism Minister Reyes Maroto told Canal Sur radio the eruption should be seen as an opportunity to entice visitors to the island.

""The island is open, if your hotel is affected we will find you another one,"" she said. ""Make the most of this opportunity to enjoy what nature has brought us.""

Volcanologist Nemesio Perez said it was unlikely there would be any fatalities, as long as no one behaved recklessly."
1193,Let's make China-Japan relationship work better,"Editor's note: CGTN's First Voice provides instant commentary on breaking stories. The daily column clarifies emerging issues and better defines the news agenda, offering a Chinese perspective on the latest global events.

China and Japan have one of the most important relationships in Asia. And with Fumio Kishida assuming the leadership in Japan, opportunity for cooperation and conflicts lie together.

Kishida, who served as foreign minister of the country previously, is known for his more peaceful and balanced approach to Tokyo's relationship with Beijing. But his decision to keep the foreign and defense ministers from the Suga cabinet in his new administration shows that there's mounting pressure to affirm a hawkish position on China.

Outgoing Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga had toughened Japan's foreign policy toward China, including pressing on several red lines regarding the Taiwan region and seeking to advance military encirclement of China with the U.S. and other countries. The new premiership of Kishida provides a positive opportunity for such dialogue to take place. However, the appointment of hawkish officials from the Suga administration in key foreign policy-related positions risks the continuation of an increasingly uncertain and tense relationship which will not be good in the long run for either country.

It is now up to Beijing and Tokyo to rectify their differences, ""agree to disagree"" and put relations back on the right track, striving for greater ""strategic stability"" as opposed to pursuing dangerous adventurism, militarism and tension.

The two countries represent Asia's two largest economies, pose the largest bilateral trade volume, are the largest two investors and thus represent the cornerstone of all growth and prosperity in this region of the world. Although the two countries struggle with longstanding historical differences and alternative geopolitical perspectives, both nations are obligated to live with one another, to make daily realities work and prevent crisis escalation.

To put it plainly, neither nation can afford to transform the other into a military adversary. Economic interdependence between the two is both inevitable, necessary and desirable."
1194,Germany's new government: A breath of renewal on European policy,"The SPD's chancellor candidate, Olaf Scholz, believes the next German government cabinet should be formed by a coalition of the SPD, the Greens and the Free Democrats (FDP). As for the CDU, this is an unprecedented setback. The party has acknowledged a ""painful loss."" But that decline hasn't stopped the party's current leader Armin Laschet from expressing his willingness to form the next government.

Which party will eventually lead the administration? That will depend on the outcome of negotiations, but it seems likely the SPD will have a chance to govern Germany in the near future.

Germany is faced with a new situation of having to form a three-party coalition, after the federal elections in October. Both the center-left Social Democratic Party (SPD) and the center-right Christian Democrats (CDU/CSU) could have the opportunity to form a government.

Editor's note: Alessandro Golombiewski Teixeira is a national thousand talent distinguished professor of public policy at the School of Public Policy and Management, Tsinghua University, and a professor of international business at Schwarzman College in Tsinghua. He is a former special economic advisor to the president of Brazil and former Brazilian minister of tourism, and minister of development, industry and foreign trade. He was also president of the World Investment Association – WAIPA. The article reflects the author's views, not necessarily those of CGTN.

Long alliance negotiations will surely follow. Germany is in a state of total confusion. If the SPD and the Greens had enough votes to form a coalition, it would be easy, but now the situation has become complicated.

In any case, it is certain that the German chancellor will be Scholz or Laschet. Scholz's calm style is considered to be like Merkel, while Laschet is viewed as a loyal Merkel supporter. For 16 years, the outgoing chancellor has made a deep mark on German and EU politics, and her departure marks the end of an era. As German politics officially enters the post-Merkel era, Germany seems to have come to a new crossroad.

Under the leadership of Merkel, Germany has played an extremely important role in determining the political and economic direction of the EU. Now, the composition of the new German government will affect the EU's decision-making on a range of key issues, such as post-pandemic economic recovery policy and relations with the United States, Russia and China.

Though the government's composition remains unclear, Scholz is thought most likely to lead Germany. If he achieves his goal to be the next German chancellor, things may take a different direction not only in Germany but also in Europe. He already stated that he will fight for European ""strategic questions for the next years,"" including the continent's sovereignty, and he wants to place Germany at the forefront of the EU to boost economic integration, which he said, ""we need in order to stay relevant in the future.""

These statements hint that Scholz wants to reduce the ""automatic alignment"" that the EU has with U.S. foreign policy. That is very good news for China, and other countries in the world. The main question would be whether the new chancellor can handle the relationship with China having been behind the U.S. trying to distance Europe from the emerging Asian power.

The future German chancellor should know that if he does not manage Germany-China and EU-China relations effectively, he will miss strategic opportunities that could represent a breath of renewal on European foreign policy.

1195,A global institution for an aging world,"Editor's note: John E. Ataguba is a professor of economics at the University of Cape Town's School of Public Health. David E. Bloom is a professor of economics and Demography at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Andrew J. Scott is a professor of economics at London Business School. The article reflects the authors' opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

The COVID-19 pandemic has made global aging impossible to ignore. This pandemic is the first to occur since the world's population aged over 65 exceeded that under five, and COVID-19-related mortality rises sharply with age.

The intersection of the pandemic and this new demographic reality has exposed a gap in our global governance architecture. There is no single international institution responsible for safeguarding the rights and advocating for the interests of the world's fastest-growing age group – those 65 and over. This institutional lacuna contributed to the lack of a unified global response to a worldwide pandemic that disproportionately affects this population. Inconsistent vaccine rollouts are the most obvious symptom, but many other dimensions of vulnerability exist. For example, in low-income countries, 46 percent of those aged 65 and over are in the labor force, and they are rarely a policy priority.

Other population groups have not been neglected. The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) targets the needs and rights of children, UN Women promotes gender equality and women's empowerment, the United Nations Population Fund focuses on issues of sexual and reproductive health, and the International Labour Organization monitors the standards and conditions of workers. An organization that emphasizes the older population is missing. Although older people are implicitly covered by the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the lack of an explicit focus on them, combined with demographic change, means they form a growing proportion of the world's most vulnerable people.

To see the difference creating an institution focused on older people would make, consider what UNICEF has done for children. Since 1990, the mortality rate for children under five has fallen nearly 60 percent. Although numerous factors are responsible, UNICEF's advocacy, as well as vaccination and sanitation programs, contributed significantly to this dramatic improvement.

The reasons for the current institutional gap are historical. The world's population structure was very different when the United Nations and the World Health Organization were established in the 1940s. In 1950, there were around seven times more children under 15 years of age than people aged 65 and older. But by 2050, these two age groups will be approximately the same size, with 1.5 billion people aged 65 and older – nearly double the number of children who were alive at the establishment of the UN and the WHO.

Filling this global governance gap requires two initiatives: a UN Convention on the Rights of Older People to provide a framework for tackling economic and social inequities and vulnerabilities, and an international agency, such as a UN Program for Older People. Many of the activities of UNPOP would mimic those of UNICEF. UNPOP would also follow UNICEF in protecting the most vulnerable and tackling abuse and exploitation.

Inevitably, a major focus would be health – where the need is great and the gap considerable. The world was largely unprepared for the COVID-19 pandemic. It cannot afford to be unprepared for the rising trend of age-related diseases driven by unprecedented but high-probability demographic shifts."
1196,HK's business environment brighter than ever with country's support,"Editor's note: Decision Makers is a global platform for decision makers to share their insights on events shaping today's world. Stephen Phillips is director-general of investment promotion at Invest Hong Kong. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

On September 27, Financial Secretary Paul Chan of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) launched the ""Report on Hong Kong's Business Environment: A Place with Unique Advantages and Unlimited Opportunities"" (The Report).

As businesses around the world look to secure growth opportunities after the ravages of the COVID-19 pandemic, the report could not be more timely. It sets out clearly the exciting opportunities in Hong Kong for international and mainland businesses. At the same time, the report sets the record straight about various misconceptions of Hong Kong as a result of biased reporting in some quarters. It is a must-read for businesses.

Since the establishment of the HKSAR of the People's Republic of China, ""One Country, Two Systems"" has been the cornerstone of our economic development, underpinning our institutional strengths which are so favorable for doing business. These strengths, coupled with many other advantages, provide the basis for our competitiveness. They are why Hong Kong has thrived as an international center for finance, commerce and trade, a home for corporate headquarters, as well as a major hub of investment, transportation and logistics.

But we can't ignore the reality that the Hong Kong economy was impacted by the social turmoil in 2019, the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and the actions of some countries. I would encourage business leaders to take a look at the facts in the report about the large-scale violence, the threats to national security, the challenges to rule of law and how Hong Kong has been subject to unjustifiable measures by certain countries. After all, the facts form the basis of sound investment and business decisions.

The good news for Hong Kong and businesses around the world is the Hong Kong National Security Law and the principle of ""patriots administering Hong Kong"" have effectively restored social stability and safeguarded the business environment in Hong Kong. Indeed a wide range of international organizations recognize this and foreign chambers of commerce here remain confident about the future.

This leads me to the key message I want to convey: the future really is one of unlimited opportunities.

Of course, every business needs solid foundations. Hong Kong provides these with our robust, inherent strengths. These include the rule of law and judicial independence; the free flows of goods, capital, talent and information; a low and simple tax regime; our robust financial system; sound regulatory frameworks; world-class infrastructure and digital facilities; our status as a free port; world-renowned dispute avoidance and resolution services; our wealth of talent; our position as Asia's international and cosmopolitan city; our safe and quality environment conducive not only to work but leisure and play. The list goes on, all underpinned by the unique advantages under ""One Country, Two Systems."""
1197,Rethinking the cities of tomorrow for a more habitable world,"Editor's note: Stephen Ndegwa is a Nairobi-based communication expert, lecturer-scholar at the United States International University-Africa, author and international affairs columnist. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

Amid all the social and economic devastation it has wrought worldwide, the COVID-19 pandemic has also come with a silver lining. A study released mid-September by the United Nations Environment Program, ""United in Science 2021 report,"" shows that confinement measures instituted by authorities to contain the pandemic caused a temporary reduction in carbon emissions.

For instance, emissions from coal, oil, gas and cement recorded an extraordinary drop of 5.6 percent in 2020, while emissions from road transport reduced by about six percent. However, these are small gains that cannot withstand the onslaught of the current trend in temperature rise. Moreover, notwithstanding its apparent environmental benefits, closing down economies is not the way to fight pollution and climate change.

COVID-19 is a once in a lifetime reminder about the things that we have long taken for granted, which have now come back to haunt us in a big way. In a world riddled with consumerism, we generally gave scant attention to the social and environmental impact of our lifestyles particularly in urban areas where the population density is high.

Social services have been pushed to the limit, raising questions of how long they can withstand the pressure exerted by perennial exponential demand. According to UN Habitat, cities consume 78 percent of the world's energy and produce more than 60 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, yet they account for less than two percent of the Earth's surface.

These are some of the critical issues of concern to authorities and players responsible for housing in towns and cities as the world marks World Habitat Day (WHD) on October 4. The theme of this year's event is ""Accelerating urban action for a carbon-free world.""

There is a need for a replacement of carbon-emitting production systems with sustainable ones that cause minimum damage to the world's flora and fauna. While it may be difficult to fully undo some of the damage that has already been done in urban centers, there is a window of opportunity for instituting mitigation measures to counteract these challenges through new models of living.

Effective action in urban renewal calls for vision and courage among various players in sectors that are instrumental in environmental conservation. These include national, regional and local governments and organizations, communities, academic institutions and the private sector.

Cities are responsible for about 70 percent of carbon dioxide emissions, with transport, buildings, energy and waste management being the major culprits of greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, we cannot continue to do the same things and expect a paradigm shift that can lead to a drastic curtailment of pollution in human habitat."
1198,Robust public health infrastructure essential for vaccine equity,"Editor's note: Lucy Chen is the global health advisor at the National School of Development, Peking University. Andre Shen is the founder and CEO of Bridge Consulting. The article reflects the authors' opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

The equitable global distribution of COVID-19 vaccines was a major subject at the 76th UN General Assembly (UNGA) last month. To date, less than 1 percent of people in low-income countries have been fully vaccinated, compared with the 10 percent in middle-income countries and more than 50 percent in high-income countries.

Leaders of various African countries, such as Rwanda, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Zambia, spoke up during the UNGA to call for equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines. Rwandan President Paul Kagame said, ""We can and must do more to speed up vaccine distribution in Africa. Doing so benefits the entire world.""

Even looking at Africa alone, there has been a large gap in vaccine distribution between North Africa and Sub-Saharan Africa. Many countries in Sub-Saharan Africa rely heavily on the vaccines distributed through the COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access (COVAX) initiative, which aims to provide equitable distribution of vaccines worldwide. However, with supply shortages, export restrictions and considerable stockpiling in some high-income countries, COVAX has been unable to fulfill its delivery targets, greatly affecting the vaccination progress in these countries.

Since more than a year ago, China has expressed political will in supporting African countries to obtain vaccines. On September 31 last year, President Xi Jinping promised China would provide COVID-19 vaccine shots as a global public good as soon as China had developed and started deploying a vaccine for use and that access would be prioritized for developing countries, especially in Africa. As of September 13, China has delivered 61 million doses of vaccines to Africa. China is also increasing its COVAX support with a $100 million donation announced by President Xi on August 5.

However, solely increasing the volume of vaccine deliveries to Africa will not fulfill President Xi's promise of making vaccines a global public good, nor will it realize the goal of vaccine equity. Simply sending vaccines that arrive at recipient countries' ports will not ensure the actual administration of vaccines to their populations. In early September, the World Health Organization's Regional Office for Africa noted that as vaccines supplies through channels like COVAX and the African Union increased, Africa could receive enough doses to meet the 10 percent target. Even so, to date, 26 countries on the continent have only administered less than half of the vaccines they have received.

Unequal vaccine distribution is only part of the reason for Africa's low vaccination rate. Even with the dedicated work from global health organizations like United Nations Children's Fund and the GAVI Alliance supporting childhood immunization in Africa over the past two decades, the vast majority of African countries face severe constraints within their public health infrastructure. This includes not having basic transport infrastructure and logistics systems that can distribute vaccines, qualified medical personnel and cold chain facilities that can store and transport vaccines, etc. It is these issues that, to a large extent, prevent countries from conducting effective vaccination campaigns regardless of the number of vaccines they receive.

Taking logistics and cold chain as an example, most of the facilities and systems in Africa have mainly been developed for national children's immunization programs, and as such, face significant challenges in the scale-up needed for COVID-19 vaccination campaigns. In practice, the vaccines that require ultra-cold storage have only been delivered to parts of North and Southern Africa, where the public health infrastructure is comparatively more advanced."

Editor's note: Wang Huiyao is the president of the Center for China and Globalization (CCG). The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

A central conference on talent-related work was held in Beijing on September 29. Chinese President Xi Jinping addressed the conference and clarified the guidelines, objectives, key tasks, and policy initiatives of talent work in the new era, which opens a new chapter for China's talent development.

As the world is experiencing great changes, the only way for such adaptation is to further deepen reform and expand openness. In this new development stage, it is important to accelerate the building of a global talent and innovation center to boost China's development.

Talent is an important aspect of national strength. China's human capital structure is shifting from being based on quantity to talent and quality.

I participated in the drafting of the National Medium and Long-term Talent Development Plan (2010-2020), which was the first medium and long-term talent development plan promulgated in 2010. In the past decade, China's talent development has continued to make progress.

According to the State Council and the Ministry of Education, China's skilled workers in 2020 exceeded 200 million people, and over 50 million of them were highly skilled; the total number of people with higher education in China reached 41.83 million.

Talent innovation is aligned with China's rapid development. China has gradually become a fertile ground for global talent innovation and entrepreneurship. From 1978 to 2019, the total number of students studying abroad reached over 6.5 million, and some 4.2 million have chosen to return to China after their studies, accounting for 86.28 percent of the group that has completed their studies.

According to the Global Innovation Index Ranking 2020, China's ranking has risen rapidly to 14th in the world from 29th in 2015. The total number of R&D personnel in China has ranked first in the world for eight consecutive years. The number of international patent applications has ranked first in the world with more than 68,000 articles.

A solid foundation of personnel is the key to achieving the country's long-term goals of realizing modernization by 2035 and making China a great modern socialist country in every dimension by 2050.

President Xi noted the need to broadly attract talent from around the globe, and there are two ways to achieve the goal.

First, we should welcome more Chinese returnees to contribute to the motherland.

Chinese students who study abroad receive an international, high-quality education, develop a global vision and enhance their international competitiveness. This experience makes those students more familiar with global rules and enhances their global networks, cross-cultural adaptability, and language skills, making them well suited to the needs of our modern globalized economy."
1200,Liberal internationalism should end with all its manifestations,"Editor's note: Azhar Azam works in a private organization as market and business analyst and writes about geopolitical issues and regional conflicts. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

In the aftermath of the Cold War, the U.S. described its role in four key elements: global leadership; defense and promotion of the liberal international order; defense and promotion of freedom, democracy and human rights; and prevention of the emergence of regional hegemons in Eurasia.

All these essential components of U.S. foreign policy are closely intertwined with each other. Washington claims the liberal international order respects territorial integrity, and values international law. America actually has used the clumsy mechanism of liberal internationalism or liberal hegemony for military intervention in remote areas to impose its democratic form of government and control the world.

Washington's invasion of Kabul to topple the Taliban government – and offensive on Baghdad, where the U.S. intelligence agencies found no evidence of weapons of mass destruction or Saddam Hussein's prewar links to al-Qaeda – was the last vestige of liberal internationalism that sought to bring democracy by force.

The U.S. falsity about forced political change in Afghanistan and Iraq was revealed by George W. Bush in 2004, when the former American president clearly expressed his goal in Baghdad and Kabul under the pretext of ""democratic"" allies. Behind delivering on the neocons' democratic demands, Washington's display of brute power had hegemonic ambitions as well.

Some U.S. officials thought restricting retaliation to Afghanistan could be dangerously ""limited"" and wanted a flamboyant victory. The purpose was to intimidate defiant Syria, Libya, Iran and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and reassert the U.S. waning hegemony in the region by trying to turn all Mideast countries into liberal democracies.

Notions about American exceptionalism are age-old and have been embedded in post-Cold War U.S. administrations. Even before the September 11 attacks, then-Secretary of State Madeleine Albright in 1998 arrogantly stated ""we are the indispensable nation"" and declared to ""put force behind the diplomacy"" as she was making the case for a possible strike on Iraq.

Donald Trump was contemptuous of the liberal international order and criticized China's ticket to the World Trade Organization, which his predecessors thought would help to turn China into a liberal democracy. He also needed big arms and diplomatic deals with the Mideast kingdoms to showcase in the 2020 U.S. presidential elections.

But Trump wasn't solely responsible for the downturn in liberal internationalism. When he took over, although proponents didn't accept the ""death"" of the doctrine, they agreed America's authority as the hegemonic leader of the liberal world order had slid into deep crisis.

Realists have been calling for less militarized and more cooperative U.S. foreign policy. They believe America should learn from its practical and moral failures to unilaterally shape the destiny of other nations by force. Putting emphasis on military restraint, diplomatic engagement and cooperation with all nations, they urge changes at the grassroots level of the U.S. overly-militarized foreign policy."

1202,"20 years after 9/11, U.S. gets back to 'square one'","On September 11, 2001, a series of deadly terrorist attacks on U.S. soil petrified the world.

The U.S. soon toppled the Taliban government. Nevertheless, on the 20th anniversary of 9/11, the U.S. must face the fact that the Taliban have reclaimed Afghanistan while U.S. troops have hastily evacuated from the country.

What the U.S. brought to Afghanistan is a complete humanitarian disaster: over 30,000 civilians were killed, more than 60,000 were injured and an estimated 11 million have become refugees as a result of U.S. military operations.

The 20-year war fought under four presidents was riddled with contradictions in policy: In 2002, then President George Bush explicitly claimed that the U.S. would be partners in rebuilding Afghanistan; in 2021, President Joe Biden said, ""Our mission in Afghanistan was never supposed to have been nation building.""

It's understandable that a war on terror is in the U.S. national interest. But it's confusing why the U.S. spent as long as 20 years and over $2 trillion on the democratic rebuilding of Afghanistan, only to end up evacuating in a rush. As a land never conquered by Great Britain or the Soviet Union during the 20th century, Afghanistan has once again proven its reputation as the ""Imperial Cemetery,"" this time to the U.S.

Besides Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria also suffered from U.S. attempts at a democratic transformation. In 2003, the Bush administration invaded Iraq on the pretext of the country possessing weapons of mass destruction. Since the Syria crisis in 2011, the U.S. government has never stopped instigating rebel forces against the Syrian government, and blatantly interfering in the country's internal affairs.

1210,What does Meng Wanzhou case tell us?,"Editor's note: Meng Wanzhou, CFO of Huawei, a Chinese high-tech company, has been released and returned home after being detained in Canada for nearly three years. The case, to some extent, has reflected the China-U.S. relations under both the Trump and Biden administrations. Huo Zhengxin, a law professor at the China University of Political Science and Law, shares his views on Meng Wanzhou's case. The opinions expressed in the video are his own, and not necessarily those of CGTN.

CGTN: What kind of legal considerations does the Meng Wanzhou incident bring?

Huo Zhengxin: In December 2018, Meng Wanzhou was detained by the Canadian authorities when she transferred at Vancouver airport. The Canadian authorities detained her at the request of the United States because the United States alleged that Meng Wanzhou had committed the crimes of wire [fraud] and bank fraud, and also committed the crime of violating its Iran-related sanctions law. And later, the U.S. government submitted a record of the case to the Canadian courts to request Canada to extradite Meng Wanzhou to the United States. As you know, there is a bilateral extradition agreement between the U.S. and Canada.

So technically, it seems that Canada has the legal duty to do so at the request of the United States. However, it should be noted that in order to extradite a suspect, the principle of ""double criminality"" should be met. Or in other words, in order to extradite Meng Wanzhou, there must be evidence to show that the actions or the behaviors of Meng Wanzhou are a criminal offense under both Canadian law and American law.

The U.S. has an Iran sanctions law. However, such a law does not exist in Canada. So, the U.S. government tried to [emphasize] that Meng Wanzhou has committed the crimes of bank and wire fraud before the Canadian courts. Since then, Meng Wanzhou has started a very difficult legal battle before these Canadian courts, and it's a very long extradition case.

So, from this case, we can find that from the very beginning, the U.S. government tried to target Meng Wanzhou, the CFO (Chief Financial Officer) of Huawei, with its notorious ""Long Arm jurisdiction."" And Canada, in this case, was only used as a means to implement [the U.S.'s] Long Arm jurisdiction.

So, from the very beginning, we believed that Meng Wanzhou is a political [hostage]. When Donald Trump was the president of the U.S., he said that he would intervene if [it] benefited the U.S. national interest and would help his government to reach a trade deal with China. So, from the very beginning, it was not a real legal case. It was a politicized [case] from the very beginning.

CGTN: Why did Trump want Meng Wanzhou arrested, and why did the Biden administration decide to drop the case now?

Huo: When Trump was in office, his government waged a trade war with China, and his government tried to target Huawei, a leading high-tech company, because the Trump administration believed that Huawei had become a challenge to the United States in the 5G technology area. And arresting Meng Wanzhou is a part of the plot to target Huawei, this Chinese company. But I should say that it's quite rare to target a company's executive instead of the company itself. So, in this case, I should say that the Trump administration had gone too far. This also may explain why the Biden administration decided to drop the case.

I think there are a couple of reasons: The first is that the arrest of Meng Wanzhou has put the U.S. in a very difficult situation because the whole world now sees that the U.S. has weaponized its domestic laws to realize its policies. So, it's not a good thing to build an image for the United States. The second is that the arrest – the detention – of Meng Wanzhou in Canada put Canada, America's ally, in a very helpless situation.

And now, Biden is trying to rebuild its relationship with its ally. So, dropping the case also helps Canada to get out of the trouble. And last but not least, I think that recently, President Biden and President Xi Jinping had a phone call. In that phone call, the two presidents also mentioned that it is necessary to maintain a sound relationship between the two powers. So, this also paved the way for the solution of this case.

I do hope that the two countries can build a very good relationship, and I do hope that Meng Wanzhou's case has ended. It would be helpful to build a good relationship between the two countries, but I should say that the future still depends on how many changes the U.S. is willing to make in its policy toward China.

1211,What's next after Meng Wanzhou's return?,"Editor's note: The video column does what the name says – takes note of ideas that may make people uncomfortable. By taking notes and breaking down various opinions, we try to provide an alternative line of thinking that will hopefully generate deeper discussion.

1,028 days. That's how long Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou stayed in Canada.

Many see her detention as the start of the decline in the China-U.S. relationship. Over the same 1,028 days, it reached the lowest points since establishing diplomatic relations. Now that she's back, what now? Is everything going to change?

The first thing that must be said is that Meng’s return is a very important, very positive step in the right direction. But, it’s not a turning point. Huawei, 5G, technology are crucial areas of interest and conflicts for China and the United States. The U.S. wanted to make a point: We don't like what we see with your development, and we will act to change it. Huawei was a symbol for what they disliked. So it was the target.

Meng's return means that the focus on the target has become less intense. But, that dislike remains the same.

You are not seeing Joe Biden easing a lot of the restrictions on Chinese companies. Many tariffs are still in place. More investigations are in the works. His commerce secretary did express the wish to strengthen business ties, but then in the same interview, she said she views Huawei as a security threat and would continue to block it from getting advanced chips. A former Clinton administration's commerce official described it as ""…her job is to paper over the decoupling and separation and try to suggest there is a positive path forward.""

Which is quite true. The Commerce Department is continuing the previous administration's efforts in working with allies to keep advanced tech out of Chinese companies. The Quad meeting in Washington ended with four countries boosting Australia's role in raw mineral exports. Australia is the world's second-biggest supplier of rare earths. China is the first. Talking about challenging a dominating position.

You can see that the thread of all action remains the same: China is a threat, Chinese technology is a threat. But the approaches are different. Donald Trump was more of a single-target hitter. He blackmails Huawei, then the next company or a sector of the Chinese economy, to get something back.

Biden's approach is different. He doesn't necessarily single out a particular company or an item. He comprehensively puts pressure. He views you as a threat, then he will use all means – political, economic, social, public opinion – everything to push you. He doesn’t just want you not to have those techs. He wants to change your behavior regardless of what you have.

So Meng's return, despite being significant progress, is still not enough to sway the entire China-U.S. relationship. It is a cause for celebration but also a time for cautiousness.

One pressure point is gone, the pressure is not. And soon, it will be applied.

1212,"Forget the speculation, here's the truth about Xinjiang's population","04:04

A vast, hot desert, Buddhist grottoes, freezing, snowy mountains… There are so many layers of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region to be explored. However, international attention has been fixed firmly on the region's demographics in recent months.

Among the disputes, the year-on-year change in population has been the most high profile. That's because the official data shows the natural growth rate dropped significantly – from 11.4 per thousand in 2017 to 6.13 per thousand in 2018. The size of the decline has sparked wild speculation. Yet the growth rate in Xinjiang remains significantly higher than the national level, the region's population trend is following the global demographic transition model, and the changes in the data are consistent with local policies and changing attitudes. Let's explore those factors through statistics.

First, the policies in the region related to births. Uygurs have traditionally lived in oases scattered within the Tarim Basin, south of Tianshan Mountains. Although listed by the central government as an ethnic minority, they are in fact the majority ethnic group in the autonomous region. From the 1970s, a series of family planning policies accelerated demographic change in Xinjiang. While Han people in the region had more restrictions on childbearing, ethnic minorities like Uygurs had larger population momentum boosted by a larger population base.

As a result, the gap between the two groups widened as time went on. In terms of the population growth rate drop-off in 2018, it was in the previous year that the Regulations of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region on Population and Family Planning were updated for the first time since 2010. The 2017 rules no longer differentiated Han people from ethnic minorities, and all households in urban areas could have up to two children, while those in rural areas could have no more than three. The couples who didn't follow the rules faced heavier legal liability, while those who followed were eligible for cash rewards. Early marriage and early childbearing are becoming less common in Xinjiang and across China. There were around 120,000 fewer newborns in Xinjiang from 2017 to 2018. In the same period, there were over 15,000 fewer registered first marriages, over 29,000 more family planning certificates issued.

Second, the number of people within a certain area should be aligned with the size of its economy and resources. Xinjiang's comparatively low level of industrialism and urbanization, as well as its imbalanced distribution and shortage of water resources, inevitably means a relatively low population density. Take South Xinjiang as an example. The actual population density was 8.08 people per square kilometer from 1998 to 2006, although lower than the national level, it exceeded the threshold of seven people per square kilometer for an arid region.

Third, looking at the overarching trend, Xinjiang's natural population growth corresponds with the general demographic transition model worldwide – currently falling after a period of increases. Globally, factors including epochal progress on medical technology and sanitary conditions, industrial production's decreasing reliance on human labor, as well as progressive attitudes towards marriage and birth-giving, have led us to the current demographic stage: a low natural population growth rate, built on the trends of a falling birth rate and lower death rate."
1213,The UK education is shifting: Implications for your education plans,"Editor's note: This letter is from Michael A. Mehari, who is the head of communications at BeGo Education, the education brand of LC Venture. The letter reflects the author's opinions, and not necessarily those of CGTN.

UK education has been arguably one the most influential system of education in the world for centuries, with the iconic universities of Oxford and Cambridge going as far as the 10th century. These two universities have been educating the elites of not just the UK but of the world. The UK is also home to some of the most prestigious UK boarding schools, with some going as far back as half a millennia. Together, they are responsible for 45 of the 55 UK's prime ministers, including the one currently in Office.

British education has also not remained confined to its shores but has been an international commodity. According to ISC Research, it is currently being taught at 12, 119 international schools across the world, with a total enrollment of 5.58 million students globally. Report show there were 485, 645 international students studying in the UK in 2018/19, with 24, 674 of them studying at British independent schools. Britain's top universities, as well as boarding and day schools, have also been the best models for educational excellence, adopted by many around the world.

However, the face of UK education is fast changing. The UK is having stiff competition form of the U.S., which has knocked it off from the top spot, attracting twice as many students from the rest of the world. But perhaps the most potent forces of change are coming from within the UK. There is an ongoing debate that the UK boarding schools and Oxbridge are caught in a never-ending cycle where they cannot escape each other and this is being fiercely challenged.

Organisations like Sutton Trust are leading the challenge. According to their report, the eight top schools had as many Oxbridge acceptances as another 2894 schools and colleges across the UK put together. The argument is that although only 7 percent of the UK population attend independent schools and roughly 1 percent graduate from Oxford and Cambridge, these elite are holding the lion's share of the government, business, media…etc. and decision-making power in the UK. They see this trend as worrying and many are demanding change.

These changes are nowhere felt than in the recent admission results to top universities, including Oxbridge. Leading UK universities are now more open to admitting students from a wider pool of students, including international applicants. They advertise contextual admission on their websites, and applications from less-advantaged regions and segments of the UK are now reaching admissions desks easily. The latest numbers with the state school Brampton Manor Academy getting more offers from Oxbridge than Eton School indicates that the top universities are paying attention."
1214,Letters to the Editor: How to fix a teacher crisis we are heading for,"Editor's note: This letter is from Leon Hady who is a former headteacher, and founder of Guide Education, which has trained thousands of teachers.

A quarter of teachers in the U.S. are considering quitting their jobs, after the difficulties of teaching through a pandemic. There are no similar figures available in the UK, but I know anecdotally many teachers feel the same - in addition to the ongoing teacher shortage.

We need to widen access to the teaching profession for non-graduates, career changers and people with the passion and skills (if not the qualifications) that make someone a great teacher. This would be particularly welcomed post-furlough when, from October 1, we can expect a spike in unemployment.

The new 'open access' teacher training should also be free. The Postgraduate Certificate in Education's (PGCE) cost of over £9,000 (post a £27,000 degree) puts so many people off - especially when teachers don't earn as much as many other professionals. We can't afford to ignore the learning opportunity chasm left by the pandemic. We also can't afford for it to get worse, as teachers leave the profession exhausted by remote teaching.

The current system is leaving us in a deficit. As many as one in six teachers quit in the first year, and that's after a third drop out of PGCE courses and more than 36,000 teachers leave the profession each year. Only 50 percent of Maths and Physics teachers remain in their posts after five years. We need new routes to qualification, and new talent filling those vacant posts.

The problem is bad now, but it will get worse, as the number of secondary school students is set to rise by 15 percent by 2027. On the current trajectory, class sizes will rise and children will suffer. The removal of teacher training colleges in the 1970s did away with a third of teacher training placement opportunities and the sky high cost of becoming teacher has done the same over the last decade.

We need to be honest about whether training to be a teacher is a smart investment for potential candidates. It can take only one more year to qualify as a Doctor than it does to become a teacher. Doctors seek to earn up to £88,000 per year after they specialize. A teacher can expect a fixed salary of around £36,000.

With the government's coffers so depleted after the pandemic, and public borrowing consistently high over the last decade (in spite of austerity), doubling salaries is not a feasible option. The alternative is to cast our net wider, including to non-graduates and make those courses free.

Many parents will ask, ""how can you teach a subject without a degree in the first""? Well, many teachers already do. Only half of Key Stage 4 Maths hours are taught by teachers with degrees in that subject, falling to only 37 percent in the most disadvantaged schools.

As a former headteacher myself, I know that the key qualities a teacher needs to have are patience, passion, communication skills and empathy. For most subjects, teachers simply don't need a degree level of education to be teaching these subjects. Subject Knowledge Enhancement Courses (crash courses in a subject ensuring that a teacher knows enough to teach) are often used.

Informally, in-school, if we have a need and a teacher has a good A-level in a subject, we ask them to teach that subject. Do we need to set the bar there in order to alleviate the teacher training issues we face? With a longer training period, as the new teaching apprenticeship outlines?

In the 1970s and 80s there was a drive to professionalize teaching with more qualifications, through universities after the teacher training colleges were disbanded and many were absorbed by universities. We ended up with several PGCE variants, which have served us well, and of course have been revised over time to improve, but its cost will always be a hindrance to some.

Rather than lowering the quality of applicants, I believe a free non-graduate route into teaching would increase it - hugely. This is because the pool of talent would be widened, meaning that those with the best natural aptitude and passion for teaching could also apply, and not just those who could afford either a degree, a PGCE, or both.

I regularly meet hospitality workers, retail workers, actors and musicians where I think ""they would be a great teacher"". A lot of them will be out of a job when furlough ends in several weeks' time. I want it to be as easy as possible for them to make that career change.

We don't remember our really great teachers because of where they went to university. We shouldn't recruit them based on that either.

1215,Letters to the Editor: The America I knew was better than this,"Editor's note: This is a letter from Yu Mengjie, a graduate from Clark University with a master's degree in communication, sharing her thoughts about the Capitol riot. There is an old Chinese saying, ""Even an upright official finds it hard to settle a family quarrel."" And I always learned from our media that it is reckless behavior to butt in other countries' internal affairs. However, with the U.S. run-off election turned into a riot and Trump supporters storming the U.S. Capitol, it is hard for anyone in the world with internet connection to turn a blind eye.

I spent two years living there, from 2013 to 2015, while I finished my master's degree and learned to drive for the first time. It was not a long period, but many memories flash in front of me now and then. Therefore, after an inner struggle, I decided to write down my feeling about the chaos. Some of my views might be personal since I am not a professional journalist, so thank you for your tolerance. Although from the previous reports, I expected some unrest along with the U.S. election process. I was still astonished to see a picture suggesting that the House of Representatives Speaker Podium had wound up on eBay. It was most likely an internet prank, yet it aptly described the chaos that the U.S. is facing. It's a joke that is hard to laugh at since the U.S. is still ranked at the top of the world economy, and it is also a country with a strong military force and nuclear weapons. Once such a country falls into turmoil, its impact on the world will be immeasurable. What is even weirder is that Trump put his people's lives in peril because he is unhappy with the election results. Five people died in the Capitol riot so far. Another thing in this chaos that leaves a deep impression on me is Facebook and Twitter's immediate response to Trump's unchained posts inciting violence. Twitter has blocked Trump's account permanently, and Facebook blocked him from posting indefinitely. People nowadays are living in a social media era. It changes the way we communicate. Information spreads faster, but it also brings some unexpected risks. Early in 1895, French social psychologist Gustave Le Bon defined the characteristics of crowds as ""impulsiveness, irritability, incapacity to reason, the absence of judgment of the critical spirit, the exaggeration of sentiments, and others. "" His theory may sound arrogant, but it seems like those characteristics are magnified on social media when people can hide their identity behind the screens. In August 2019, political theorist at Harvard University Danielle Allen had already foreseen that, yes, ""speech on a social media site, or a presidential platform, can eventually incites violence"" and advocated that the rules of incitement should apply to social media.

1216,Changes in China,"Editor's note: This is a letter from Graham Smith, a writer, teacher, and long-term China resident, who shares his views on the changes that have taken place in a Chinese city where he first moved to more than a decade ago.

I recently moved back to China, having spent six years back in the UK. Having lived in a medium-sized third-tier city in Jiangsu Province and then Tianjin and then Beijing the first time around, I've come full circle and returned to the city in Jiangsu I initially moved to in 2007. (I'll keep it unnamed, if that's alright). I hadn't visited it in nine years, so the changes both to the city itself and life in general seem phenomenal.

It's a much-repeated truism that China is developing rapidly, but sometimes it's useful to step back and delineate exactly what has gone and what is new.

The city I found in 2007 had about two million people in the urban areas. I chose it because I was offered a job teaching at a university, which provided an apartment and meals on campus, while the students would also have a decent standard of English, which I thought would make things easier for a newcomer. (I had never previously been further east than Budapest, so felt an understandable degree of trepidation).

It was a great introduction to China, far from the Western imports of Shanghai and Beijing. There were maybe 10 foreigners in the entire city, so there wasn't an expat bubble. But because few students had ever seen a foreigner before, they constantly remarked ""Laowai!"" or ""Hullo!"" when I passed by. It might have been understandable that they would comment on such a novelty, but it grew very tiresome. The university's old campus was just outside the city center, and between them were two streets filled with numerous tiny mom and pop shops and restaurants, selling some of the best noodles I've ever had in my life (you could literally watch the cook slice them off with a razor) at very reasonable prices.

There weren't much leisure facilities: there was a pool and snooker hall with spittoons on the floor, KTV bars, bath houses and a dreadful smoky nightclub, the memory of those toilets even now fills me with horror; but that was about it. Shopping for Western items was difficult: for items like decaffeinated coffee, oregano, or pasta I had to take a five-hour bus to Shanghai and then hunt out the foreign food store in some upmarket hotel. The local supermarket astonished me with its tanks with live eels, turtles and frogs, and customer service was an idea just taking hold. (I remember one hot day asking for ice with a drink, and the consternation and confusion of the waiting staff). When buying any larger item you had to see one salesperson, who would write out a receipt, and then another, where you would actually pay money. It felt like you bought things at the convenience of the shop.

But now? Now it's very different. The city center has been massively redeveloped, knocking down the little shops and restaurants for giant plazas and shopping malls. A tram glides back and forth in the street in front of the university gate.

Shopping is a totally different experience. E-commerce is everywhere. Previously I had never used Alipay or WeChat, but this time I have yet to use cash for anything. Meituan delivery riders in their yellow jackets are highly visible, and make ordering food incredibly easy. Taobao similarly makes buying household items a frictionless task. Young people now have the money to be fashionable, with girls in Japanese Loli outfits and boys in upmarket denim and sneakers. The new shopping malls reflect the priorities of the population: in one of the largest, with eight stories, floors two and three are dedicated to educational and extra-curricular activities for children.

Taxis, once so cheap and plentiful, can't be easily flagged down any more – it's all about ordering them through Didi. (In Beijing where I would sometimes spend half an hour trying to flag one down, this must be an absolute godsend). The roads are perhaps even busier, but the driving seems significantly better. Car horns, which once peep-peeped like bats trying to blindly navigate, now honk less vociferously.

Smoking seems also to have substantially declined. In 2014, according to the medical journal The Lancet, two thirds of Chinese men smoked, and there were few genuine restrictions on doing so indoors. But according to the 2018 China Adult Tobacco Survey, smoking among Chinese aged 25-44 and 45-64 has decreased significantly. It feels like a genuine sea change.

Meanwhile, the tower blocks throng all through the city, not just in the center. I don't recall seeing any before, but now there must be hundreds of 30-story tower blocks. There are several massive shiny new office blocks too. And the pace of life seems significantly quicker.

This isn't the sleepy backwater of 13 years ago. This is now a city bubbling with life, in the way that China does so excitingly.

And no one has called me laowai.

1217,DPRK's latest missile tests might compel concessions from the U.S.,"Editor's note: Andrew Korybko is a Moscow-based American political analyst. The article reflects the author's views and not necessarily those of CGTN.

The Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) carried out a series of missile tests over the past few weeks. These include cruise missiles, ballistic missiles, what it claims to be hypersonic missiles, and most recently anti-air missiles. These actions are aimed at drawing international attention that its leadership could then leverage to resume meaningful dialogue with the Republic of Korea (ROK) and the U.S. for the purpose of sanctions relief, military de-escalation, and peace on the Korean Peninsula.

This spree of tests reminded the world that the Korean War has never officially ended. It also showed that the DPRK is still capable of researching, developing, testing and perfecting high-level weapons systems even during the pandemic. It remains unclear whether its latest self-described hypersonic missile test was really part of that elite weapons class or not, but if it was, then it would be a regional military game-changer. American, Japanese, and ROK missile defenses like the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) would be neutralized.

Presuming some degree of truth to the DPRK's hypersonic missile claims due to the embarrassment that its leadership would feel on the world stage if that test wasn't what they said it was, the U.S.'s military options would be extremely limited. No country is presently capable of intercepting hypersonic missiles and probably won't be for a while. These arms could cut through the U.S.'s regional defenses like a knife through butter and thus bestow the DPRK with unprecedented capabilities to either carry out a first strike or respond to its opponents through a second one.

Pyongyang has made it clear that it has peaceful intentions though after offering to resume an inter-Korean hotline. At the same time, however, it rebuffed the offer for talks from the U.S. Joe Biden administration, describing them as a means for disguising hostile policies. This suggests that the DPRK might be trying to divide the ROK from the U.S., which is an old tactic but one which might have a greater chance for success considering that America is incapable of defending its ally from Pyongyang's hypersonic missile capabilities."
1218,Germany's new beginning,"Editor's note: Joschka Fischer, Germany's foreign minister and vice chancellor from 1998 to 2005, was a leader of the German Green Party for almost 20 years. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

Germany has voted, and its seemingly eternal chancellor, Angela Merkel, is finally stepping down after 16 years. In fact, that is the only certainty that the election has offered. Everything else remains ambiguous.

Unlike their neighbors on the left bank of the Rhine, the Germans are no revolutionaries. The latest federal election has proven that once again. Far-left and far-right parties have been further weakened.

Political stability and continuity are a near-essential constant for Germany, owing to its history, size, and location in the heart of Europe, and they are values that a majority of German citizens obviously hold dear. Had Merkel decided to run again, she almost certainly would have been re-elected.

And yet, the same majority had become fully aware that Merkel's approach could not go on. Her method of ""driving by sight,"" waiting things out, and dithering was tantamount to a complete renunciation of a strategic vision for Germany and Europe. Germany needed a break with the past – a new start – and that is what its electorate has now voted for, even while still ostensibly opting for rule from the center.

On the surface, it seems that nothing much has changed. As always, the fight for the chancellorship – the head of the future federal government – will be between the country's two traditional mainstream parties, the Social Democrats and the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), with its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU). Each won only around a quarter of the vote, with the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) holding a slim lead over the CDU/CSU.

The outright dethronement of the two erstwhile big-tent parties would have seemed too much like revolution and therefore didn't happen. Support for the Greens did not rise enough to give them a claim to the chancellorship, probably because a similar message of change could be delivered in a less ostentatious fashion.

The real change – which by German standards can almost be called a small revolution – lies in the sudden transition away from the two-party coalitions that were previously the norm at the federal level; a future of three-party coalitions now awaits. Though they still came out on top, the SPD and the CDU have been severely weakened. That fact alone will fundamentally change the balance of power in any future coalition government."
1219,Expo Dubai as an opportunity for globalization: Better late than never,"Editor's note: Gao Lei is an assistant professor at the Collaboration Centre for Theories and Practice of Open Economy, Center for Xi Jinping Thought on Opening-up at the University of International Business & Economics. The article reflects the authors' opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

Under the theme of ""Connecting Minds, Creating the Future,"" Expo 2020 Dubai, which was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, is now open for business until March 31, 2022. The World Exposition, or the World Fair, which was initially designed to display the innovation and cutting-edge achievements in science, technology, manufacturing and even socio-economic governance all over the world and in the hosting state, in particular, was first held at Crystal Palace in London, UK, in 1851. Back then, the British empire, where the Industrial Revolution began with the UK as the leading great power, enjoyed most of the privileges and fruits of expanding productivity for the first time during the long journey of human civilization.

As much as we would never cease criticizing and condemning the exploitation of other parts of the world through imperialism and colonialism, we would still need to recognize at least two trends promoting the great exhibition: globalization and the development of science and technology.

Karl Marx, as he moved to London in 1849, paid close attention to the entire process of the great exhibition at Crystal Palace, not far away from where he lived. Less than one year before that, he and Frederich Engels, who lived and managed a family business in the northwestern British city of Manchester, collaborated and published one of the masterpieces in the history of human thought, The Communist Manifesto.

In this work and through regular correspondence, they both highlighted the exhibition itself, the significance of the fast development of productivity and the impact of globalization upon the international community. As the pair saw it, people all over the world would take a path of closer and closer connection that is irreversible, industrial development would bring prosperity to countries experiencing industrialization that is unstoppable, and advanced technology would release enormous and unpredictable potential in creativity and innovation.

In addition to these positive points, Marx also keenly grasped a negative one – the contradictions among states via fierce competition. But he mentioned little about the solution.

In 1851, China was still under the rule of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911), which showed little interest in catching up with cutting-edge technology and management skills. With the emperor's focus being on the sparkle of the Taiping rebellion that was kindled in south China, the authorities could spare little energy and resources for industrialization. But there were Chinese products in the exhibition that even received awards, yet it was private rather than official activity."

Editor's note: Yared Nigussie is an economic and political commentator based in Addis Ababa. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

Ethiopia's economy is tottering. The cost of living is becoming very high as inflation balloons continuously. The Tigray War in the north has cost $2.5 billion and international investors are staying away, according to Louw Nel, a senior political analyst at NKC African Economics, a consulting firm.

The war that has lasted for nearly a year has been disrupting supply chains and, as United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told the Security Council in August, it has drained $1 billion from Ethiopia's coffers.

The conflict has had its own negative impact on prices.

Currently, the cost of everyday goods is skyrocketing alarmingly and even the middle class are finding it hard to buy even basic commodities. Although Ethiopia's inflation woes predate the conflict, they have been exacerbated by it.

Inflation has risen on average by 30.4 percent, according to the Central Statistical Authority (CSA). Food inflation reached 37.6 percent in August, the highest in 10 years.

Economists assert that a profound reason is the aggressive spending of the government and sections of society on food items for soldiers who are fighting in Tigray.

However, the primary and prolonged reason for the galloping inflation is the lack of aggregate supply from the agricultural sector, the backbone of the nation's economy. Farmers, especially in northern parts of the country, are joining fighting militias to fight, leading to worsening supply shortages."

Editor's note: Bradley Blankenship is a Prague-based American journalist, political analyst and freelance reporter. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

U.S. President Joe Biden's most ambitious legislative push, his signature ten-year $3.5 trillion spending bill supported by progressives, looks like it may end up being sacrificed in order for Democrats to focus on avoiding a government shutdown and passing a bipartisan infrastructure package.

Should that be the outcome for the larger Biden bill, as so-called moderates are threatening, it would call into question the future of his entire domestic program. Based on how U.S. politics has worked for some time, this probably would spell doom for his presidency - at least in terms of his domestic vision - and I've previously written about why that is.

Instead of delving deep into this issue again, it would be appropriate now to take stock of how this reflects deeper systemic issues in Washington and why Biden's situation is not even close to being unique.

For one, Presidential candidates make promises all the time and fail to deliver on them. This was the case with former president George H. W. Bush when he famously said, ""Read my lips: No new taxes."" In reality, however, Bush had to compromise on raising some taxes with congressional Democrats in order to reduce the national budget deficit.

Bush's broken promise on what was seen as his signature is widely recognized as one of the major reasons why he was a one-term president, losing in 1992 to Bill Clinton.

But there are more recent comparisons that are better fitting for the situation the Biden administration is still reeling from, namely from his two most recent predecessors, Donald Trump and Barack Obama, on the still-relevant issue of health care reform.

Then-president Barack Obama, who Biden served under as vice president, made health care his signature issue. After riding into power on a wave of strong public disfavor with outgoing president George W. Bush and the Republican Party, the Democratic Party held their first federal ""trifecta"" since 1993 and was poised to push much-needed health care reform.

Appeals were immediately made to centrists which meant scrapping the idea of a ""single-payer"" system like those in other developed countries, later tossing out a more moderate ""public option"" system before settling on the final version of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) that is virtually identical to a policy proposed in 1989 by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank.

With the ball firmly in their court, Democrats' internal fighting left the issue of health care still unsolved for millions of Americans – and so much so that it's still one of the major political issues in the country. An ever-growing number of progressive Democrats are now in favor of that original single-payer system, believing the ACA to be simply a band-aid on a gaping wound.

On the other hand, the unpopularity of the ACA among Republicans was a major campaign point for every Republican presidential candidate since its passage, including Donald Trump who also came into power with his party holding a federal trifecta.

Trump had promised to ""repeal and replace"" the ACA with a palatable Republican alternative, but this, and even attempts to simply repeal and replace later at an unspecified date or vote through a ""skinny repeal"", broke down in Congress."
1222,Key lessons based on China's fast development,"As the People's Republic of China celebrates another National Day, it's important to remember that it has been a long and winding road that took China from an underdeveloped country decades ago to a great power in the world today. Within a few generations, Chinese people have moved from widespread poverty, illiteracy and subsistence farming to becoming the world's second-largest economy, eliminating absolute poverty and setting up a nationwide social network that provides health care and affordable education for all.

The first lesson the world can learn from China is the value of making a long-range plan and sticking to it. The most notable example of this is its Five-Year Plans started in 1953, which have laid the blueprint for everything from eliminating poverty to reforming the economic system.

The second lesson is the government's willingness to invest in the country. Decades of planning and investment have left China with a magnificent infrastructure – roads, high-speed railways, airports and waterways. Infrastructure is the very foundation of trade and prosperity. Similarly, the country is pouring massive amounts of money into research and development, somewhat similar to the U.S. investment during the Space Race. According to the white paper titled ""China's Epic Journey from Poverty to Prosperity"" issued on September 28, China spent 2.4 trillion yuan ($370 billion) on research and development in 2020, ranking second in the world.

By the end of 2020, China had established 533 key national labs, 350 national engineering research centers, 1,636 national enterprise technology centers, 212 mass entrepreneurship and innovation bases, 1,287 national technology enterprise incubators, and 2,251 makerspaces approved by the Ministry of Science and Technology.

The third lesson is that the Chinese government puts people first — not lobbyists or powerful business interests. This explains why China was able to protect its public from COVID-19 epidemic and some other countries were not. It also explains why Chinese people show very strong support for their government. Before making any decisions, the government widely consults stakeholders, including holding public hearings and calling for public submissions on any policy changes. China does not have paid lobbyists who corrupt the political process by funding elected representatives' campaigns in exchange for favors."

Editor's note: Nikola Mikovic is a freelance journalist based in Serbia. He covers mostly Russian, Ukrainian and Belarusian foreign policies, and writes for multiple web magazines. The article reflects the author's opinions, and not necessarily the views of CGTN. The fate of Syria, Libya and Nagorno-Karabakh heavily depends on wider geopolitical deals between Russia and Turkey. Although the two countries have been rivals throughout most of history, Moscow and Ankara now act as partners and regional actors that have a potential to reshape the future of the Middle East and Caucasus.

On September 29, Russian President Vladimir Putin hosted his Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan in the Russian Black Sea resort of Sochi, some 500 kilometers from Crimea. A week before the meeting with Putin, the Turkish president told world leaders at the 76th session of the UN General Assembly that Ankara firmly supports Ukraine, and will never recognize the incorporation of Crimea into the Russian Federation. Such a statement drew criticism in Moscow. Days after Erdogan's speech, Russia increased air strikes on Turkey-backed forces in northwest Syria. Was that the Kremlin's response to Erdogan's address to the United Nations? Turkish reaction to Russian air strikes was rather moderate. Ankara ""strongly condemned"" Russian actions, but hesitated from taking any radical steps. Instead, Erdogan told Putin in Sochi that joint Russo-Turkish steps regarding Syria are very important, since the peace in the war-torn country depends on relations between Moscow and Ankara. The Middle Eastern nation is just one neuralgic point where Russia and Turkey support different sides. In Libya, the Kremlin openly backs Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar and his Libyan National Army, while Ankara firmly stands behind the UN-recognized government in Tripoli. A potential deal between Putin and Erdogan could result in a diplomatic solution to the civil war that erupted after Muammar Gaddafi was overthrown in the NATO-backed uprising in 2011. Still, Russia and Turkey are not the only foreign powers operating in the north African country, which means that sustaining peace in Libya is possible only in coordination with other actors involved in the conflict, namely Egypt, France, and the United Arab Emirates. The situation in the Caucasus, on the other hand, is not that complicated. The region has traditionally been in the Russian sphere of influence, but after the war over Nagorno-Karabakh between Armenia and Azerbaijan in 2020, Turkey managed to position itself as another ""factor of stability and peace."" In other words, the 44-day conflict changed geopolitical reality on the ground. Russia deployed peacekeeping troops to the turbulent region, and Turkey increased its influence in Azerbaijan. Rumors are flying that Ankara may be planning a military base in the country, which would mean more NATO presence on the Russian borders. However, despite backing opposing parties in Syria, Libya and the Caucasus, Turkey and Russia have forged close cooperation in the field of energy, defense and tourism. The TurkStream pipeline, providing natural gas from Russia under the Black Sea to Turkey, is already fully operational.

Yuan has published several papers on China-U.S. security relations in Chinese academic journals and is a regular contributor to many Chinese media outlets.

China is holding its eighth National Martyrs' Day on September 30. President Xi Jinping, together with other Chinese senior officials, veterans, young children and representatives from all walks of life attended the solemn ceremony at Tian'anmen Square, where they sang the national anthem, held a minute of silence and presented flowers to the Monument to the People's Heroes. This day gives the Chinese a pause for reflection and preparation for renewal for their nation.

A day of reflection

The National Martyrs' Day is a day of commemoration to the heroes who sacrificed their lives for national independence and people's liberation. The day was chosen as September 30 every year because it is the day the Monument to the People's Heroes was laid, on the eve of the founding of the People's Republic of China on October 1, 1949.

On this day, memorials are held across China. There are tens of thousands of monuments, museums and halls dedicated to people's heroes across China and hundreds of commemoration sites on foreign lands, which represents various Chinese ethnic groups who shed blood for national independence.

The commemoration of martyrs is a sacred ritual in China. The huge sacrifices that the martyrs and all Chinese people made have shaped the identity and character of the Chinese nation, that is perseverance and invincibility against outside invaders to safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity. In fact, over 35 million people died during the war of resistance against Japan, which demonstrated China's enormous contribution to the global Anti-Fascist War."

Editor's note: Zhou Wenxing is assistant professor at the School of International Studies, Nanjing University. The article reflects the author's opinions, and not necessarily the views of CGTN. Former Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida is set to become the country's next prime minister after winning the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) leadership election on September 29. The election of Kishida has drawn much attention. What concerns China is whether the would-be prime minister would follow or change the confrontational China policy his predecessor Yoshihide Suga has been pursuing. China's concerns are not groundless.

The right-wing political forces are gaining ground due to China's continuous rise even in the post-COVID-19 pandemic era. Out of their growing strategic anxiety, more political elites, including those from the LDP, tend to advocate for a tough policy toward China. In order to get elected, Kishida, who has long been viewed as a moderate, also made some strongly worded expressions about China during the LDP presidential race. For example, he warned that ""the Taiwan Straits will be the next big problem"" in early September during an interview with Bloomberg News. After taking office, the new prime minister is expected to fulfill these, if any, commitments he made during the race. Besides, as the Shinzo Abe-era foreign minister, Kishida is believed to be affected by the former prime minister when making his China policy. During his premiership from 2012 to 2020, Abe adopted a hedging policy toward China and the U.S., namely, developing economic ties with China while collaborating with the U.S. in terms of security to balance against the former. In view of Abe and the relevant faction's significant influence, Kishida would be impacted more or less when dealing with China. Lastly, the strategic relationship between China and the U.S. remains unchanged. Japan has been following the U.S. in terms of foreign policy after World War II. Currently, the Joe Biden administration is still pushing forward the so-called strategic competitive policy toward China, particularly by strengthening U.S. allies including Japan. With this structural context at play, Kishida would follow U.S. policy to some extent.

1226,China's new outline for women's development reinforces their rights,"Editor's note: Li Juan is a researcher and lecturer at the Human Rights Institute at Southwest University of Political Science and Law. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN. On September 27, the State Council issued ""The Outline of Women's Development in China (2021-30),"" a medium- and long-term plan for implementing the basic national policy of gender equality in the new era. The new Outline aims at prolonging women's lives and improving women's health, the primary field of development. This shows that China values the protection of human rights, especially women's rights. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), sustainable development can only be achieved when women ultimately have the right to make free, informed and responsible choices and can consciously protect their rights and interests in society. Women's health is an indispensable part of Health For All. The new Outline emphasizes women's reproductive health and proposes strategies and measures, including popularizing sex education, sharing contraceptive responsibilities of men and women, ensuring women's right to make informed choices about contraception and birth control, preventing unwanted pregnancy, and reducing abortions for non-medical purposes. Reproductive health is an important part of women's health and is closely related to every individual, every family and the health of offspring. The 1994 Cairo International Conference on Population and Development, and the 1995 United Nations Fourth World Conference on Women linked reproductive health issues with women's rights, pointing out the right to reproductive choice is a basic human right and should be protected and respected.

However, the strategies and measures proposed by the Outline have also caused some misunderstandings, such as the belief that reducing non-medical purposes abortions limits women's freedom of reproduction. This interpretation is erroneous and ignores facts.



First, reducing non-medical purposes for abortion should be interpreted under the target framework of reducing unintended pregnancy and improving women's reproductive health, and its starting point is to better protect women's lives and physical health. As sex has become increasingly common among young people, the lack of knowledge about contraceptives has led to a gradual increase in unintended pregnancies. For instance, a report from China Daily in 2015 revealed an estimated 13 million abortions were performed in China, and 62 percent of the abortions were done to women aged between 20 to 29. In addition, the ""2020 Report on Reproductive Health in China"" indicates 25.9 out of 1,000 women in China had induced abortions in 2014, and the number increased to 28.3 in 2018. The year 2018 alone witnessed a repeated abortion rate of 55.9 percent, meaning 55.9 of 100 women undergoing induced abortion have done it twice or more. Besides these hard facts, terminations of pregnancy will damage women's reproductive health, easily causing complications like habitual abortion and infertility. Therefore, sex education is crucial to preventing unintended pregnancy, reducing abortions for non-medical purposes and protecting women's reproductive health.



Secondly, the reduction of routine abortions is also to eliminate sex-selective terminations of pregnancy. The Chinese government has taken measures to forbid abortion caused by the sex of a fetus. However, some places in China still have a strong preference for sons, and a lot of women are forced to have multiple abortions to give birth to boys; some have even lost their lives. Restrictions on this behavior therefore would ensure women's reproductive choice, rather than limiting their freedom. The abortion of female fetuses seriously violates women's rights to life and health and undermines the realization of gender equality. Hence, measures to reduce abortion for non-medical purposes are necessary.



In conclusion, as China allows couples to have three children, the reproductive right of women is in dire need of protection. The new Outline has provided a basic framework for protection, but ensuring women's health still has a long way to go.

1227,"Analyzing legal, political issues surrounding historic Arctic voyage","Editor's note: Nong Hong is the executive director and a senior fellow at the Institute for China-American Studies. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

Renowned Chinese sailor Zhai Mo and two crew members embarked on a four-month voyage beginning at the end of June this year, attempting to circumnavigate the Arctic for the first time in human history. However, Canada stopped their sailboat in the Arctic Ocean near Lancaster Sound, a part of the Northwest Passage.

This voyage does not challenge Canada's sovereignty or legal status over the Northwest Passage as claimed by a report on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC). One of the issues that worry Canada the most is whether China will adopt the same legal position as the United States and the European Union: treating the Northwest Passage as a ""strait for international use"" in opposition to Canada's claim to it as ""internal waters.""

In its Arctic Policy White Paper in 2018, China maintains that all activities to explore and utilize the Arctic should be conducted in compliance with treaties such as the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and the Svalbard Treaty, as well as with general international law. However, the white paper does not touch on the status of the Northwest Passage and other straits in the Arctic, focusing instead on the considerable opportunities and challenges posed by economic and environmental considerations. Hence, of the Arctic five (Canada, Denmark, Norway, Russia and the United States), Canada is the most concerned about the white paper's implications, warning that China's Arctic policy is attempting to tread a fine line between respecting the sovereignty of Arctic nations and leaving room to profit from disputes in international law.

Zhai's request to pass through the Northeast Passage, in order to shorten the distance compared with passing through the Panama Canal, was rejected by Canada based on its Interim Order No. 3 – Restricting Pleasure Craft Navigation Due to COVID-19. Article 6 (1) of this order stipulates that Transport Canada may, in writing, exempt a person from the application of any of the prohibitions set out in this interim order in some circumstances, e.g., the minister of health, after being consulted, determines that public health and safety and the protection of the marine environment will, to the extent possible, be maintained. Sources in China said that Zhai and the other two crew members conducted self-quarantine before June 30 when they started the tour, and the risk of epidemic spread is extremely low. But it is up to the Canadian authority to define whether this exemption is applicable in Zhai's case."
1228,Modernizing our arsenal against malaria,"Editor's note: Abdourahmane Diallo is a former health minister of Guinea and the CEO of the RBM Partnership to End Malaria. The article reflects the author's views and not necessarily those of CGTN.

Consider the humble mosquito. When compared to some of the world's most notorious and vicious predators, it might not look like much. And yet it has killed more people in history than any other creature. As a carrier for some of the world's deadliest diseases, including malaria, yellow fever, Zika, dengue, and chikungunya, it instills fear in tens of millions of people around the world.

Malaria, the oldest of these diseases, dates back to the time of the dinosaurs and continues to have a devastating impact on people's lives. Each day, it deprives thousands of young people of a future. Among the 400,000 deaths from malaria recorded in 2019, two-thirds were children under the age of five, and almost all lived in Africa.

Throughout my career in public health, I have seen modern technology transform our centuries-old fight against malaria in the space of just a few decades. Insecticide-treated mosquito nets, indoor residual spraying of homes, rapid diagnostic tests, and new treatments and prophylactics were not even part of the conversation when I started work on my medical degree. Now, these interventions are saving lives every day.

Ensuring wider access to these innovations has been instrumental to the progress we have made in ending suffering for millions of people and eliminating the disease in many countries. But it is clear that these tools will not be enough to achieve the ultimate goal of eradication.

Mosquitoes and the malaria parasite have survived as long as they have by constantly adapting to new conditions. Now, growing drug and insecticide resistance in the Greater Mekong Subregion and Sub-Saharan Africa threatens to weaken our current tools for prevention and treatment. Collaboration between scientists and the private sector is urgently needed to develop new medicines to combat resistance to artemisinin, the main component of the first-line drug that treats the most common form of the disease, and to insecticides that stop the malaria-carrying Anopheles mosquitoes in their tracks."
1229,Kishida offers an opportunity for China-Japan ties to improve,"Editor's note: CGTN's First Voice provides instant commentary on breaking stories. The daily column clarifies emerging issues and better defines the news agenda, offering a Chinese perspective on the latest global events.

Fumio Kishida was elected leader of the Liberal Democratic Party of Japan (LDP) on Wednesday, winning a tight race to succeed Yoshihide Suga as Prime Minister. Kishida, who served previously as foreign minister, is seen as a moderate contender on a competition that turned into a shouting match over hawkishness on China, with Tokyo having hardened its strategic position against Beijing in recent months owing to increased pressure from Washington.

Despite this, Kishida's victory was the best possible option for Beijing compared to his rivals, but the question remains: can ties between the two countries recover?

In line with American preferences, Japan has positioned itself as a military and strategic competitor against China, an approach which accelerated under Suga's legacy as Prime Minister. Tokyo has, in the past few months, reaffirmed its support for separatism in China's Taiwan and sought to incorporate the island into their own national strategy, whilst cooperating more strongly with Washington via the Quad.

Despite the enormous China-Japan economic relationship, this has sent ties between the two on a dangerous trajectory.

Kishida is not likely to change this new status quo radically given Japan's own position, but nor is he about to drastically make it worse. This provides some opportunities.

Kishida hails from the moderate faction of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) that are more restrained when it comes to China. As described by Reuters, Kishida ""hails from one of the LDP's more dovish factions and is seen as lukewarm about revising the pacifist constitution."" Representing Hiroshima has also made him more reserved about military aggression and nuclear weapons.

This contrasts to the more hawkish position pursued by Suga's faction. An article in The Diplomat this month quotes, ""Kishida would look to carefully balance the Sino-Japanese relationship and the Japan-U.S. alliance."""
1230,U.S. can't have economic ties with China à la carte,"Editor's note: CGTN's First Voice provides instant commentary on breaking stories. The daily column clarifies emerging issues and better defines the news agenda, offering a Chinese perspective on the latest global events.

The U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo has recently made a spree of seemingly contradictory comments concerning America's economic relationship with China.

On the one hand, she said ""there's no point in talking about decoupling"" and that ""we have no interest in a Cold War with China.""

But on the other, she is unleashing a litany of complaints about China and insisting that America maintains its lead on manufacturing and critical technologies such as semiconductors, bemoaning ""cheap labor"" which sent capabilities overseas. She has also been reaching out to Europe urging the two sides to work together to slow China's innovation.

But actions speak louder than words.

The U.S. might stress the importance of its economic relationship with China now and denies the premise of decoupling, something the previous administration would never admit. But in practice, Washington continues to ramp up a hybrid war against China on multiple fronts that very much risks creating a Cold War.

The U.S. continues to stress a policy of unreasonable and obsessive protectionism, it continues to attack China's leading technology companies and encourage others to do the same by seeking monopolies over certain sectors, and likewise persists in ramping up military tensions around China's own periphery.

The Biden administration may not be as callous and unhinged as the Trump presidency, yet for all intents and purposes, its policy towards China remains the same.

That policy has never been about denying China is of an economic benefit to the U.S., but about aiming to subjugate and entrap China strategically – a clear move to exclusively benefit from China's markets for its own ends. The policy is about demanding greater access whilst simultaneously aiming to hamstring Chinese companies of strategic and technological significance."

Indeed, today's anger and alienation present an opportunity to address cracks in our societies' economic foundations, starting in the United States. Commercial activity is being rapidly digitized at scale, suggesting that the largest and most successful companies in the technology sector – from Amazon to Zoom – will continue to be dominant market forces for the foreseeable future. Yet while investors in these fast-growing enterprises have enjoyed significant financial gains, most others have not. The leading tech companies have fallen short not only in creating value for many of their stakeholders but also in contributing to U.S. economic growth overall. Indeed, now that everyone has adapted to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, many business leaders have shifted their focus back to quarterly profits and share prices. Just this month, Microsoft, the world's second-most valuable publicly traded company, announced a $60 billion share buyback plan and dividend increase. Meanwhile, there has been very little talk of what management teams could do to create long-term value for shareholders and stakeholders alike. Mounting evidence, presented by the International Monetary Fund and many others, suggests that Big Tech companies are stifling innovation through their acquisition strategies and competitive practices. If one believes, as we do, that economic growth is predicated on innovation, then one must support urgent action to address this problem. Beyond the various legislative proposals to break up Big Tech firms, there are some simple steps that the newly confirmed chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Gary Gensler, can take immediately to ensure corporate accountability among technology firms and to encourage sustained commitments to innovation for America's shared benefit.

First, the SEC can and should require all publicly traded companies in the U.S. to disclose clearly how much they spend on research and development (R&D). Under decades-old accounting standards, this category includes only activities aimed specifically at developing new products, services or processes, or at major improvements to existing products, services or processes. Small, incremental ""routine or periodic alterations"" are expressly prohibited from being qualified as R&D.



Yet, much to the country's social and economic detriment, several of today's Silicon Valley giants have lumped together such minor alterations under their R&D expense-line items. Given that the biggest technology companies command a large and increasing share of the economic pie, transparency about how much they are investing in genuine innovation is fully warranted.

Second, the SEC should make the long-overdue switch back to semi-annual reporting. Research suggests that there are high costs associated with the quarterly disclosures that every public firm currently undertakes. The formation of a capital market in which management teams must constantly issue profitability guidance has fostered a short-term mentality with far-reaching adverse economic consequences.



Short-termism has hampered managers' ability to make substantive long-term investments, shortened the average tenure of chief executive officers (CEOs), and diminished managers' capacity to make decisions that may be crucial to U.S. competitiveness in the global economy. Likewise, burdening small publicly traded firms – the foundation on which the economy is constructed – with repetitive and substantial reporting costs impedes growth-oriented investment by diverting resources.



Beyond these reforms to encourage change from the top, the pandemic has created an opportunity to reinvigorate grassroots innovation. This fall, millions of U.S. students have returned to the classroom, some for the first time in more than a year. Because state governments are relying on federal funding to continue to educate the country's youth, we have a once-in-a-generation chance to bring about fundamental change in the delivery of education at the local level.



Economists, intellectuals, entrepreneurs and politicians share a general dissatisfaction with America's educational performance relative to its peers. In particular, U.S. schools have evidently failed to nurture creativity, risk-taking and challenge-seeking in today's young people. These values played a seminal role in U.S. national development and should be inculcated in students as they return to the classroom.



The last 18 months have brought disruptions but also opportunities for positive change. America's capitalist system will need to adapt to the new world. That means, for starters, re-centering the economic conversation around stakeholders and our shared future. The return to schools and campuses should occasion a return to education that celebrates the core and essential American values that helped the country become such an unprecedented success.



As we look to the future after the pandemic, we must focus on strengthening our institutions and reinvigorating our culture. To that end, shoring up the next generation's intellectual foundation and providing corporations with the flexibility to innovate are just two steps we can take today. Many more can follow from those. Although America's social, financial, and political challenges remain as stark as they have ever been, we can strive for a rebirth of the values and institutions we need.

1232,"Virtual influencers to revolutionize marketing, but not without issues","CGI icons, such as Miquela in the U.S., based on British model Emily Bador's physical features, and Rozy, a South Korean model, command vast followings on social media. Miquela, a perpetually 19 years old all-American teenager, boasts three million followers on Instagram, sharing her life story, with a team of developers behind the scenes crafting her engaging narrative.

By contrast, human models and celebrity personalities make a riskier investment for brands looking to create eternally young and controllable ambassadors for marketing. This creates seismic changes for both marketing industries and young followers on the receiving end.

Virtual influencers, or computer-generated personalities (CGI), are starting to gain traction in the social media sphere. Animated personalities and models now command huge followings in Asia and can generate vast sums of money for their creators in brand endorsements and advertisements.

Brands are always looking for an edge in competitive markets, and appealing to the new generation of young digital natives is crucial for success. Brands such as Calvin Klein, Samsung and Prada have all got in on the action, converting their legion of followers into customers.

China too is at the forefront of this trend, with CGI influencers such as Ling making deals with the likes of Tesla and Nayuki, one of the largest bubble tea chains in the country. CGI influencers are harder working than any human influencer could possibly be and with little risk of scandals destroying a brand's reputation by proxy. Peace of mind for companies is something that unpredictable human celebrities can never 100 percent guarantee.

Forward-thinking corporate companies are also increasingly keen to associate their brand with the creative tech-savvy of CGI influencers alongside the financial rewards. The UK marketing think tank OnBuy suggests that British CGI influencers earn significantly more than the average social media salary of $46,703. In 2020, U.S. marketers spent $3 billion in total on influencers in the last year, a lucrative industry showing no signs of stopping with more CGI influencers on the horizon.

The market is so big now that niches can be filled with various bespoke influencers. Specialist personalities can be created to target certain audiences and appeal to brands looking to penetrate markets with a high degree of accuracy. Our increasingly rich digital world now has room for influencers to facilitate all commercial activities, such as shopping, socializing and being entertained at every level.

CGI influencers are largely uncharted territory. Human celebrities have the advantage of appearing real and complex, something consumers may relate to more. However, this dichotomy between authenticity and novelty has found a middle ground in other parts of Asia.

In Japan, v-tubing or virtual YouTubers, where human influencers create 3D avatars of themselves in whatever image they see fit, are gaining popularity. These ""holostars"" can earn seven-figure sums in brand deals, merchandise deals and patron donations from subscribers. Most importantly, they provide a medium where creators can express themselves on a personal level without the mechanical feeling of a team of developers being behind their image.

Paradoxically, the persona that the creator puts out can mean that influencers reveal more intimate details about themselves while simultaneously protecting their personal lives.

Technical issues and glitches may be another hurdle for this budding marketing revolution. Virtual influencers may very well be easily controlled down to the very last pixel. However, it is still possible for the developers behind the scenes to make mistakes. Running costs for animation, voice actors and a plethora of other production fees also stack up. A quick video for a human influencer may take hours and hours of painstaking labor for a team of animators.

Real influencers also have a physical presence and leverage with fan meet and greets. But CGI influencers can never meet their avid followers in reality and may lose this aspect of emotional connection as a result. Many may think, ""If this person is not real, why should I purchase their endorsed products?"" However, whether the illusion then shatters when followers realize they cannot build a strong emotional connection with virtual influencers remains to be seen.

Further complications arise when the issue of accountability is considered. CGI influencers could never go rogue or say something rude unintentionally, but if a product they promote turns out to be faulty or causes problems for their buyers, who is responsible?

Whether an entire team of developers can be liable in such situations remains to be seen, and this legal framework is still being worked out as the technology continues to become more and more popular. Virtual celebrities may currently be taking the world by storm; however, just how cohesively they fit into Asia's gigantic marketing industry remains to be seen.

1233,AUKUS will exacerbate the arms race,"President Joe Biden, joined virtually by Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, speaks about a national security initiative from the East Room of the White House in Washington, D.C., the U.S., September 15, 2021. /CFP

President Joe Biden, joined virtually by Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, speaks about a national security initiative from the East Room of the White House in Washington, D.C., the U.S., September 15, 2021. /CFP

Editor's note: Sumesh Shiwakoty , a policy analyst and commentator, currently serves as a board member and South Asia director for the U.S. Department of State-funded California-based non-profit ""United by Love,"" has worked in the past with the World Policy Institute in New York, has received a research grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, and written analyses for publications including The National Interest, The Diplomat, and The Times of India. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

In his announcement of AUKUS, the trilateral security pact between the U.S., UK, and Australia, U.S. President Joe Biden stated that the deal will ensure ""peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific over the long term."" President Biden is wrong. If anything, the opposite is true.

AUKUS will exacerbate the arms race while seriously undermining the current international nuclear nonproliferation governments. The deal will further militarize the Pacific. Only the military-industrial complexes of the three nations will benefit, while those who will pay the ultimate price will be the people of Pacific island nations.

Many of the world's leading nuclear policy experts and scholars have expressed concern that AUKUS will cause the proliferation of highly sensitive military nuclear technology. To operate nuclear-powered submarines under this deal, Australia must be the first to exploit a loophole under the 1970 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), which allows non-nuclear-weapons states to acquire nuclear-powered submarines and remove nuclear materials used for fuel from the inspection system of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).

We can assume from Australia's indication that its nuclear submarines will not need refueling that it will use highly enriched uranium (HEU) like that of the U.S. and the UK, instead of low enriched uranium. The danger for nuclear nonproliferation government is obvious, as currently, the American and the British nuclear submarines use HEU enriched above 90 percent, a similar concentration of uranium, for making nuclear weapons.

James Acton of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace states that while it is improbable that Australia will acquire nuclear weapons, this ""will set a damaging precedent,"" making it difficult for a nonproliferation government to deter future proliferators. He is right.

Other nuclear countries could exacerbate the arms race by exploiting this same loophole to supply nuclear technologies to countries that are interested in acquiring nuclear weapons. AUKUS will also heavily militarize the Pacific as it includes cooperation on underwater technologies to long-range strike capabilities. This will invite rival powers to militarize the Pacific further.

On the other hand, the AUKUS deal has alienated a close NATO ally of the U.S. and UK. Australia's unilateral cancellation of its $66 billion contracts to purchase diesel-powered submarines from the French defense contractor the Naval Group is a severe economic setback to the French defense industry.

France showed its anger by recalling its ambassadors from Washington and Canberra, having never before recalled an ambassador from the U.S. The French foreign minister called the deal a ""stab in the back,"" while French opposition politicians asked France to leave NATO."
1234,Hong Kong is open for business,"Editor's note: Alexandr Svetlicinii is an associate law professor at the University of Macau, where he also serves as program coordinator for the Master of Law in International Business Law in English Language course. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

On September 27, 2021, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) of the People's Republic of China (PRC) issued a report on the region's business environment signaling to the world that it is open for business. The present note highlights the specific features of Hong Kong's legal system, which under the ""One Country, Two Systems"" principle, creates a favorable environment for international business.

Grounded on Article 31 of the PRC Constitution, the fundamental principles of the HKSAR's legal system are embedded in the HKSAR Basic Law. The law guarantees the protection of private property, including the ownership of enterprises and investments from outside the region. The HKSAR Basic Law also provides that no foreign exchange control policies are applied in the region and ensures the free convertibility of the Hong Kong dollar and free flow of capital in and out of the region.

According to the report, Hong Kong currently maintains 22 investment promotion and protection agreements with 31 foreign economies, providing further assurances for the protection of foreign investments.

In terms of international trade, Hong Kong is a separate customs territory and a distinct member of the World Trade Organization. It maintains its status as a free trade port and safeguards the free flow of goods, assets and capital. Hong Kong benefits from closer integration with the Chinese mainland through the Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement, the development of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, and the adjacent cities of the Guangdong Province.

Following the principle of ""One Country, Two Systems,"" the HKSAR Basic Law ensures the continuity and stability of the HKSAR legal system based on common law and remaining largely intact following the PRC's resumption of sovereignty over the region in 1997. The laws previously in force in Hong Kong and regulating business transactions, including the common law, rules of equity, ordinances, subordinate legislation and customary law were largely maintained."
1235,Why the U.S. intelligence shouldn't be trusted,"After 20 years, trillions of dollars and countless lives, how is it even possible that U.S. intelligence got it so wrong? Well, when considering this question, it's important to recognize the fact that this is by no means a unique situation for U.S. intelligence.

He said the major problems were that the U.S. and its partners didn't understand, among other things, the endemic corruption of the Afghan military's senior ranks, the effects of the U.S.-brokered Doha agreement or, it could be said, the morale of the soldiers they had been training for two decades.

U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin's testimony was the inspiration for this question. In his words, he said that the Afghan military's sudden collapse following the American retreat had apparently taken everyone by surprise.

In the first congressional hearings about the U.S. retreat from Afghanistan, top military officials shared details about the haphazard operation that brought an end to America's longest war. After hearing the testimony from these officials, one key question came to mind: How much can anyone even trust U.S. intelligence at this point?

Consider just some key intelligence mistakes that we already knew about in Afghanistan. The U.S. had entered Afghanistan in 2001 with the explicit goal of uprooting al-Qaida and denying it a safe haven in the country. They had also launched an international manhunt for Osama Bin Laden, the group's former leader who U.S. intelligence believed to be hiding somewhere in Afghanistan.

But it turned out that he was hiding out in Pakistan, a fact which was revealed not through the astounding work of U.S. intelligence but actually based on a tip from a walk-in, a former senior Pakistani intelligence officer, at the U.S. Embassy in Islamabad, according to a 2015 investigation by award-winning journalist Seymour Hersh.

We also know, despite what Austin said, that corruption in Afghanistan has been highly widely acknowledged for some time. According to the so-called Afghanistan Papers published by the Washington Post, top U.S. officials had long come to the consensus that the war was unwinnable yet misled the public on this fact to prolong the war.

One figure that speaks to this corruption is the fact that an estimated 40 percent of U.S. aid to Afghanistan ended up in the hands of corrupt officials, warlords, criminals and insurgents.

But it didn't end there. As the U.S. had announced a clear path to withdraw from Afghanistan, anonymous U.S. intelligence officials leaked details of an alleged Russian intelligence program designed to pay Taliban fighters to kill U.S. soldiers. This was the subject of wall-to-wall media coverage, dubbed ""Bountygate,"" designed to pressure then-President Donald Trump into staying in the Afghanistan quagmire.

U.S. President Joe Biden himself admitted in April that this very serious allegation was based on a U.S. intelligence assessment made with ""low to moderate"" confidence. In essence, this allegation was unproven at best but more than likely false.

This is the exact same U.S. intelligence apparatus that has constantly gotten it wrong or deliberately lied. Most famously, former U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell, who had previously served as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told the United Nations Security Council that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction based on ""facts and conclusions based on solid intelligence.""

Whether it was a deliberate lie or an honest mistake, hundreds of thousands of Iraqis lost their lives after the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq that was based on intelligence that was plain wrong.

Similarly, declassified documents from the National Security Agency (NSA), Department of Defense and White House show clearly that high-ranking U.S. officials had distorted the truth surrounding the Gulf of Tonkin incident in 1964 to mislead the public into a full-scale U.S. invasion of Vietnam, another one of America's most controversial and unpopular wars.

It then begs the question of how reliable U.S. intelligence actually is and how seriously should anyone take alleged security risks emanating from U.S. assessments? One also has to wonder what good the U.S.'s global spying apparatus setup does, if anything.

There seem to be two interpretations. First, that the U.S. outright lies to advance its ""interests,"" which almost never has to do with the actual interest of its citizens but rather the insatiable greed of its military-industrial complex. Second, that top U.S. officials are extraordinarily incompetent, which is terrifying if Washington is supposedly the leader of the free world.

Both of these are interpretations. Even a combination of both should raise serious doubts in the international community about Washington being a reliable security partner.

1236,What climate change requires of economics,"Editor's Note: Daron Acemoglu is professor of economics at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). The article reflects the author's opinions, and not necessarily the views of CGTN.



This summer's record-breaking heat wave in the American northwest offered a reminder – as if it were needed – of what anthropogenic climate change will mean for living conditions now and in the future. Average global temperatures have already risen to 1.2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and could increase by another 5 degrees Celsius over the next 80 years. This warming is hastening the extinction of many species and rendering parts of the world less hospitable for human habitation. By some estimates, climate change may force more than one billion people to migrate by 2050.



Confronted with such massive long-term risks, many of our long-held assumptions will need to be revised, and the economics discipline is no exception. If we are going to avoid misguided policy pathways such as those that would abandon economic growth completely (even though billions of people around the world are still in poverty), we need to adapt mainstream economics to new climate realities.



True, the discipline has long recognized the importance of environmental issues. William D. Nordhaus, the recipient of the 2018 Nobel prize in economic sciences, introduced the costs of greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions into standard economic-growth models in 1991, and this work has shaped how economists and many policymakers think about climate change.



But existing approaches in economics still do not provide the right framework for managing the problems that will confront us over the next several decades. As with most early works, Nordhaus's seminal contribution can be improved in many ways. For example, his framework does not recognize the endogeneity of technology, and its assumptions about the future costs of climate change do not reflect the severity of the problem.



When we account for endogenous technology, we find that the transition to cleaner energy is much more important than simply reducing energy consumption, and that technological interventions need to be redirected far more aggressively than they have been. Similarly, when one incorporates more realistic assumptions about the costs of global warming – including the possibility of climate tipping points – one's conclusions about how to approach the problem tend to change substantially.



But these improvements alone will not suffice. Economics will need to undergo even deeper changes, for at least two reasons. The first concerns the bedrock of most dynamic economic analysis: the utility function, which represents the trade-off between current and future consumption. This device helps us determine how much consumption a decision-maker should be willing to sacrifice today to realize more value at some point in the future. It has proved its uses in many domains of analysis: individual consumption, investment decisions, public spending, innovation, tax policy, and more.



The key question for a climate-policy utility function is: How much current consumption do we need to sacrifice to avoid the damage that global warming will cause in the future? The answer will depend on how we approach the problem of discounting. When thinking about individual or corporate decisions whose consequences will play out within the next decade or so, it makes sense to start from the premise that one dollar will be less valuable 10 years from now than it is today. But when applied to decisions whose effects will be felt 100 years from now, this kind of discounting has some unpleasant implications.



Suppose we apply a discount rate of 5 percent, which is common in analyses of individual or corporate decision-making and implies that a dollar a year from now is worth 95 cents today. But this discount rate would also mean that a dollar 100 years from now is worth only about half a cent and that a dollar 200 years from now is worth about 0.003 cents. At this rate, we should sacrifice $1 today only if it will yield benefits equivalent to about $200 a century from now – a benefit-cost analysis that lends itself to climate inaction in the present.

Economists have recognized this inconvenient implication of discounting for climate policy at least since the 2006 ""Stern Review."" In that report, Nicholas Stern and his colleagues dispensed with the hard discounting approach and thus arrived at policy recommendations that were more aggressive than those supported by the economic consensus at the time. But because the Review did not offer a philosophical justification for its chosen method, it was criticized by other economists, including Nordhaus."

1238,China's epic journey is emulatable by the entire Global South,"Editor's note: Andrew Korybko is a Moscow-based American political analyst. The article reflects the author's views and not necessarily those of CGTN.

China is the world's largest developing country and naturally has a moral responsibility to assist the rise of fellow countries in similar positions. On September 28, 2021, its State Council Information Office released a 71-page white paper titled ""China's Epic Journey from Poverty to Prosperity,"" which could serve to inspire other Global South countries to emulate its general development model in accordance with their own national traditions. This detailed report deserves to be read in full, given its wealth of data and insight, but the present analysis will highlight the main characteristics of China's epic journey for those with limited time.

The People's Republic of China made unprecedented contributions to humanity due to the Communist Party of China's (CPC) unwavering commitment to putting its people's interests first. The CPC's vision of building a ""Xiaokang,"" or ""moderately prosperous society"", is in consonance with China's historical traditions. It prioritizes not only material development but also its immaterial component through its strong support for socio-cultural programs. Equitable and sustainable economic development is maintained by eco-environmental policies and the CPC's effective management. Social equality and justice drive domestic policy.

Speaking of internal policy, the CPC acts as the core of the country's decision-making processes though it importantly operates according to the principles of socialist consultative democracy. This sees the CPC relying on feedback from all elements of society with a particular emphasis on workers and minorities. Together, the CPC and the Chinese people devise, implement and improve upon the country's policies. This people-focused governance model is meritocratic and sets the global standard in this respect. It also effectively roots out economic, political and social corruption, the latter increasingly referring to pernicious foreign influences.

True prosperity for all is ensured through their mutually beneficial and complementary interactions. Historically unparalleled achievements, such as the full elimination of extreme poverty last year, were only made possible through their cooperation. Reforms, and specifically the policy of opening-up, play integral parts in this national rejuvenation process, as does the cultivation of patriotic sentiment throughout society. Everything is always improving because of the earlier mentioned feedback loops and the trust-based synergy between the CPC and the Chinese people. Their hard work makes this all possible."
1239,Inside the U.S. extrajudicial killings: A 'Western immorality'?,"Editor's note: Ahmad Faraz is an independent researcher on international issues focusing on Asia. The article reflects the author's opinions, and not necessarily those of CGTN.

On September 30, 2011, a Hellfire missile launched from a drone landed in Yemen, killing a radical cleric and al-Qaeda propagandist, Anwar al-Awlaki. He became the first U.S. citizen to be killed in a ""targeted killing"" by a U.S. drone strike. Then-president Barack Obama ordered the killing, and it bypassed all existing legal procedures existing in the U.S. constitution. Human Rights activists marked the event as an ""extrajudicial killing."" Interestingly, according to the Intercept report, al-Awlaki was never charged with any crimes, let alone a conviction.

However, two weeks later, another drone attack shook the Yemeni soil killing al-Awlaki's 16-year-old boy, Abdulrahman al-Awlaki, alongside other civilians. Abdulrahman was not the primary target of that strike. The Obama administration justified the strike. Moreover, according to The Intercept, Obama's press secretary even blamed the boy for his own death that he should have ""had a more responsible father."" Perhaps the saying may be true, the sins of the father visit upon their sons. But for al-Awlaki, the sin visited twice as six years late in 2017, Nawaar al-Awlaki, his eight-year-old daughter, was killed alongside 30 civilian casualties in a botched-up operation led by U.S. Navy Seals Team in Yemen. According to Reuters, she was shot in the neck and suffered for two hours.

The year passes by; the story remains the same, marking different victims in different regions. On August 29, just days before the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, a drone strike killed ten civilians of one family. The target was an innocent aid worker and his family members, including seven children. The U.S. merely acknowledged the mistakes, and according to a BBC report, described the strike as a ""tragic mistake"" only.

The events and tragic stories are only a glimpse of the U.S. extrajudicial killings, the practice of targeted killings, and violations of human rights internationally. It seems, in the name of national security and war against terror, the champion of Human Rights is continuously violating human rights and bypassing international laws and norms for decades.

Targeted killings

According to Carpenter's writing in Foreign Policy, targeted killing is a clear violation of Human Rights. Target listing or making a ""kill list"" is also a violation of basic tenants. There are international prohibitions on this issue. But it seems, since 9/11, the current hegemon- The U.S. itself is breaching these laws on a daily basis. The al-Awlaki case has become the face of U.S. targeted killing. In this regard, Carpenter also argued that even if al-Awlaki was the al-Qaeda propagandist, killing him was illegal as there was no evidence of him taking part in armed conflict, a standard set by the International Committee on Red Cross definition.

However, this is not the only prohibition the U.S. has breached. The drone strike of Qasem Soleimani also violated international laws related to internationally protected persons. As an official of the Iran government, Soleimani was an internationally protected person. Therefore, killing Soleimani is a violation of international laws and norms.

Apart from international laws and norms, targeted killing is also an act of ""extrajudicial killings,"" and it overrides due legal process and ""right to justice."""
1240,Reinvigorating multilateralism,"Editor's note: Carlos Alvarado Quesada is President of Costa Rica. Jacinda Ardern is Prime Minister of New Zealand. Stefan Löfven is Prime Minister of Sweden. Cyril Ramaphosa is President of South Africa. Macky Sall is President of Senegal. Pedro Sánchez is Prime Minister of Spain. The article reflects the authors' opinions and not necessarily those of CGTN.



Last year, the United Nations conducted a worldwide consultation involving more than one million people from 193 countries. The feedback pointed to some important facts. And this year's UN General Assembly must respond by bolstering rules-based multilateralism.

For starters, the consultation found that the expectations and hopes of the world's women, men, girls, and boys are strikingly similar. People want better access to basic health care, sanitation, and education. They also want to see more solidarity with those hit hardest by the pandemic and with those living in poverty. Respondents' top concern over the long term is the twin crisis of climate change and accelerating biodiversity loss. Almost 90 percent of participants agree that global cooperation is vital to deal with today's challenges, and a majority believe that the pandemic has made international cooperation even more urgent. Especially encouraging is that young people worldwide clearly want more international cooperation.

Last year's consultation was a call to action. Now, UN Secretary-General António Guterres has released Our Common Agenda, which follows on the UN75 Political Declaration adopted by all UN member Heads of State and Government one year ago. The new agenda sets out a bold plan for how we can tackle the challenges of today and tomorrow.

The threat of breakdown must be viewed as an opportunity for a breakthrough. That is why we commit to stepping up our countries' support for the secretary-general's efforts to translate the UN's ambitious agenda into reality.

The COVID-19 pandemic, which we are still battling at the global level, has driven home the message that we live in an interconnected and interdependent world. Moreover, in the last few months, we have seen record numbers of people affected by heatwaves, devastating floods, and some of the largest wildfires in recent history, confirming once again the unparalleled threat posed by our changing climate.

The UN is the heart of the international system. The fact that the world came together 76 years ago to create an organization to ""achieve international cooperation in solving international problems"" is extraordinary in itself. But even more striking is that this organization, despite its challenges and shortcomings, has endured. It has shown that the path to a better, more peaceful, and sustainable future is paved with cooperation, not zero-sum competition.

However, the world's international organizations were built primarily to resolve inter-state challenges, not problems that transcend borders, such as financial crises, pandemics, terrorism, crime networks, threats to our oceans, or climate change. We, therefore, must modernize our multilateral institutions, making them fit for purpose and better equipped to deal with the global and cross-generational challenges we face."
1241,China: Farewell to poverty and longing for prosperity,"Editor's note: Lu Xia is an associate professor at the School of Marxism Studies and a research fellow at the National Academy of Development and Strategies, Renmin University of China. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

Almost three months ago, President Xi Jinping, in his speech at the ceremonial gathering of the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China (CPC), declared to the entire world that China had achieved the great goal of building a moderately prosperous society by eradicating absolute poverty, a phenomenon that existed in Chinese society with a long history. This historic achievement deserves analysis and generalization of the experience in retrospective as well as formulation of plan and schedule in prospective. And it has been fulfilled by a white paper, entitled ""China's Epic Journey from Poverty to Prosperity,"" issued by China's State Council Information Office. In addition to the description and display of the country's journey to moderate prosperity in all respects, aka xiaokang, this official document attaches great significance to the realization of the goal in terms of its competence, challenges and contribution by claiming that it marks a critical step toward national rejuvenation for the Chinese nation.

People-centered prosperity

To borrow former U.S. President Abraham Lincoln's famous quote, moderate prosperity in all respects are prosperity of the people (from all social categories), by the people (via the leadership of the Party), and for the people. Just like what I argued about China's common prosperity in my last op-ed essay, the key of achieving prosperity is a dynamic integration of the realization people's all-round development and the development of all the people. Without poverty being alleviated and poor regions being well-off, there will be no moderately prosperous society in an all-round way. Thus, moderate prosperity in all respects is actually a form and stage of common prosperity.

Since the 18th National Congress of the CPC, poverty alleviation has become one of the priorities of the Chinese authority, which was embodied in the Two Centenary Goals. To view and understand moderate prosperity in all respects, one should use concrete and tangible criteria. Not only does it tackle the issue of livelihood for each and every single Chinese citizen, but it also aims to reduce the imbalance of development level, living standards and resources disposal between urban and rural areas.

So in the process of building moderate prosperity, the overall planning of urban and rural has become more coordinated and the new wave of urbanization in certain regions has placed people at the center. As a result, the gap between urban and rural has been gradually narrowing and the connection between urban and rural areas has been significantly strengthened. In reality, the re-balance between urban and rural will ultimately benefit people of both groups.

Coordinated and integrated prosperity

In the early 1980s, when chief architect of China's reform and opening-up policy Deng Xiaoping borrowed the word xiaokang from ancient Chinese classics to describe a better-off living condition for Chinese people and to set strategic goals for China's development, he was referring not only to the improvement in economic fields, but also a bigger blueprint. Like all the countries which took the path of industrialization and modernization, China also had to face issues like ecological deterioration and deepening of social inequality."
1242,Groundless slander underpins Tokyo's cybersecurity strategy once again,"Editor's note: Hamzah Rifaat Hussain is a former visiting fellow at the Stimson Center in Washington, former assistant researcher at the Islamabad Policy Research Institute (IPRI), and a TV anchor at Indus News in Pakistan. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily those of CGTN.

The adoption of a draft cyber security strategy (CSS) 2021 by Japan, which focuses on a three-year time frame till 2024, has once again presented an alarmist interpretation of regional dynamics which contradicts reality. The strategy set to replace Tokyo's current one, which was adopted in 2018, is purportedly aimed at targeting perceived threats, but it is actually a case of pointless engineering of scenarios which lack any credibility. China and Russia were targets and it coincides with the Quad announcement of technology initiatives which hinted at siding with China's Taiwan region. The veracity of the claims made can be questioned on merit alone.

Firstly, there is a glaring contradiction between Japan's proposed strategy of working with local governments by implementing policies through public trust and the remarks of Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato, of which the latter came prior to the official endorsement by the cabinet for the CSS 2021, because there is no confirmation that any cyber attacks from Russia or China during the Olympic and Paralympic games of 2020 took place.

Examined further, the wording of the CSS 2021 suggests that China is ""believed"" to be conducting cyber attacks while Russia is ""suspected"" of being involved in hostile cyber activities without pointing out the exact contours, scope, modus operandi or even the locations where such activities are taking place. This entire strategy is built upon conjecture once again and will only promote misunderstandings as parallel hawkish Indo-Pacific strategies are devised by the Quad.

Note that in principle, mere conjecture and contentious observations cannot underpin cyber security strategies aimed at tackling hybrid warfare. Yet Tokyo has undertaken this path with the ironic aim of securing national and regional security. By definition, it is the exercise of kinetic and non-kinetic strategies which require independent verification, which in this case borders on smear campaigns and slander instead of facts.

With this baggage, Japan is also mulling the option of accelerating cooperation in the cyber field with ASEAN member states without any due cognizance of whether the respective leaderships would be receptive of such hollow strategies.

Note further that the decision to adopt a cyber security strategy coincides with the development of various technology initiatives by Quad member states including India, Australia, Japan and the United States, with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison mentioning how efforts were afoot to make emerging technologies aimed at protecting a ""stable Indo-Pacific."""
1243,For the people: How China built a moderately prosperous society,"On September 28, the Chinese government released a white paper titled ""China's Epic Journey from Poverty to Prosperity."" The paper details how China established itself as a ""moderately prosperous society."" Chinese President Xi Jinping declared in July this year that thanks to the continued efforts of the whole Party and the entire nation, China had realized the first centenary goal of building a moderately prosperous society in all respects, a goal which coincides with the national revival of China.

The transformation of China from a peasant agrarian society into a ""moderately prosperous"" nation is one of the most drastic and profound economic transitions in all human history. Never in any other incidence has a nation of such a size and population been able to so rapidly reverse its fortunes and join the ranks of major powers. As the paper quotes: ""This achievement reflects the Chinese people's aspiration for a better life, and their indomitable will to surmount all difficulties and challenges on their way forward. It has boosted their pride and confidence in the nation, and inspired further endeavors on the quest for national rejuvenation.""

The paper explores how the institutional role of the Communist Party of China made such a trajectory possible. Prior to its rule, China was a ""poor and backward country."" The rise of the Party to power with its vision of reviving the country initiated a ""social revolution"" and helped overcome China's ""century of humiliation,"" drastically changing the country and establishing ""the fundamental political conditions and the institutional and material foundations"" for prosperity, a role which was accelerated through reform, opening up and modernization. It notes the Party followed the traditional Chinese idea of Xiaokang – the hope and dreams of the people for a better life.

But in moving the country forward, the establishment of a ""moderately prosperous society"" is not merely ""development for development's sake"" or the idea that only some people get rich at the cost of others. China sees the interest of its entire people as a collective endeavor that it must strive to achieve and protect."

Editor's note: Freddie Reidy is a freelance writer based in London. He studied history and history of art at the University of Kent, Canterbury, specializing in Russian history and international politics. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily those of CGTN. The election of a new NATO secretary general may not be done until September 2022, but the process is an arduous one, taking months of protracted negotiations between the organization's 30 members. Recent events though have caused many nations to re-evaluate the relationships and priorities of their fellow members.

The chaotic U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan took many nations by surprise, forcing rapid responses and leaving many citizens and partners at great risk. The move was also a powerful symbol of America's foreign policy objectives, the formulation of which appears increasingly unilateral despite overtures to the contrary from the White House. The second major obstacle is over attitudes to the Russian Federation. Many eastern member states are increasingly wary of their eastern neighbor and as such are keen for a strong candidate from a member state on the border. Coupled with these strategic prerequisites is a desire within the alliance to have a female secretary general for the first time in 72 years. With this in mind, Croatia's Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovic, Estonia's President Kersti Kaljulaid and Dalia Grybauskaite of Lithuania are all leading candidates. However, while the female criterion may be satisfied by such a choice, the more dovish voices in the alliance, Germany and France, are likely to be wary of what could be perceived by the Kremlin as an antagonistic appointment. U.S. President Joe Biden has also tried to calm relations between Washington and Moscow which were particularly strained during his time as vice president. If serious questions over the U.S.'s commitment to global security as well as differing attitudes over Russia presented major challenges, the announcement of the tripartite AUKUS alliance between Australia, the United Kingdom and United States only served to pour fuel on the fire in seriously disturbing the harmony within NATO.

1245,The good and bad in Germany's election,"Editor's note: Jan-Werner Mueller, professor of politics at Princeton University, is the author, most recently, of ""Democracy Rules"" (Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2021). The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

First, the bad news. In Germany's federal election, the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) suffered losses, but still polled in excess of 10 percent. Despite constant infighting and numerous scandals, the party seems set to be a lasting feature on the German political landscape.

But the good news is that the election disproved various kinds of conventional wisdom about the far right: Western democracies are not fated to fight culture wars constantly; grand coalitions between center-left and center-right do not necessarily strengthen political extremes; and social democratic parties can do well without pandering to nativism and Islamophobia.

Many sophisticated observers have been saying that a struggle between cosmopolitan liberals and more ""rooted"" communitarians (to use as neutral a phrase as possible) defines politics in the advanced economies nowadays. While some conflicts might be understood in the context of a more or less simplistic divide between ""anywheres"" and ""somewheres,"" there are plenty of other challenges that cannot be reduced to this binary.

In Germany, immigration has receded as a major concern in recent years. In the run-up to this election, citizens instead cited pensions, the future of the welfare state, and climate as the issues that concerned them most. The main parties staked out different positions on these issues, and a classic contest between center-right and center-left proved to be bad news for the far right.

The fact that citizens had a choice between two clear policy alternatives meant the typical populist complaint that all ""mainstream"" parties are the same, and that supposedly corrupt elites pursue the same policies to harm ""the people,"" hardly rang true.

Nor did the grand coalition between the Social Democratic Party (SPD) and outgoing Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democratic Union (CDU) bear out the assumption that such arrangements provoke support for extremist parties. Instead, the Social Democrats signaled a clear leftward turn and a break with the era of Merkel.

There also was speculation that discontent with the government's handling of the pandemic would prompt citizens to vote for AfD simply because it seemed like the only consistent way to register protest. After all, AfD is the only party not in power anywhere in Germany's federal system, in which nine different coalitions govern the country's 16 states.

There are two reasons that did not happen. First, for many Germans, AfD is a party bent on historical revisionism, which is to say relativizing the Nazi past. It seems that even some staunch conservatives who were deeply disappointed by the CDU's management of COVID-19 do not want to be associated with anything that smacks of neo-Nazism. AfD's inability to capture discontented voters shows that its strategy of trying to be both respectable and radical could work for only so long."
1246,From moderate prosperity to modern society,"Editor's note: Wang Huiyao is the president of the Center for China and Globalization (CCG). The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

China on September 28 issued a white paper detailing how achieving moderate prosperity in all respects has benefited the country. ""A moderately prosperous society in all respects is a society in which all people share the fruits of development, a society where no individual, region or ethnic group is left behind, and a society that promotes the well-rounded development of all,"" said the white paper.

The 13th Five-Year Plan (2016-2020) was a decisive period for China in its mission to build a moderately prosperous society. The successful fulfillment of this goal by the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China (CPC) is an extraordinary achievement, particularly taking into account the complicated international situation and impact of the global pandemic.

Having achieved this feat, the 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-2025) is of great importance because it not only sets a guideline for China's economic and social development in the next five years and beyond, but also marks the first five-year period in the CPC's quest to meet its second centenary goal.

The original formulation of a ""moderately prosperous society"" was defined in quantitative terms – to double the GDP and per capita income of urban and rural residents by 2020 as compared to 2010. By 2019, China had reached an annual GDP of 99 trillion yuan ($14.4 trillion) – already more than double the 2010 figure of 41.2 trillion ($6.37 trillion) – with a per capita GDP of $10,276.

The nation's economic development, though a bright spot, is not the sole focus of building a moderately prosperous society. Major breakthroughs have also been made in other areas. There has been a real improvement in the living standards of Chinese people, as reflected by the steady rise of various indicators. For instance, the Human Development Index (HDI) has increased from 0.49 in 1990 to around 0.76 in 2019. Life expectancy is also well above the world average, reaching 77.3 years by 2019.

Despite the progress in the areas mentioned above, the CPC also needed to ensure that the development pattern is balanced. During the 40 years of reform and opening-up, China has helped more than 850 million people out of poverty, accounting for more than 70 percent of global poverty reduction during this time.

Over the past three decades, global poverty alleviation has lagged far behind the pace of globalization, and rising inequality has been the main cause of the recent wave of counter-globalization. Thus China's achievement in poverty alleviation is of global significance and can contribute to the further development of globalization by contributing to global poverty alleviation. Domestically, the poverty alleviation program significantly reduced the gap between rich and poor in China.

China has leveraged its system and policy advantages on the way to building a moderately prosperous society. The government has taken advantage of infrastructure, industrial development, education, health support, and environmental protection to foster development."

Editor's note: Bobby M. Tuazon is the director for policy studies of a Philippine think tank, Center for People Empowerment in Governance (CenPEG), and a professor at the University of the Philippines. He is also an editor and co-author of 15 books. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily those of CGTN.

At the start of his presidency, Joe Biden vowed to rebuild America's alliances, which he said had been diluted by his predecessor's ""America First"" policy. Targeting China, Biden redefined his alliance system as ""a united front of democracies"" that upholds a rules- and human rights-based international system. This united front strategy is now sculpted into Biden's new ""Pivot to Asia,"" where he seeks to marshal the support of the Asia-Pacific - a strategic region in terms of broadening America's military encirclement of China.

Globally speaking, it has become clear that the overarching goal of the U.S. today is to curb China's economic, trade and technological power, allowing the current superpower to maintain its hegemony in the world. As the U.S. Coordinator for Indo-Pacific Affairs on the National Security Council Kurt Campbell said, the main challenge facing the U.S. is conjoining ""European and regional instruments"" to address the ""Chinese challenge.""

In Southeast Asia, Biden's new strategy set off a string of communications, with top U.S. officials talking to their counterparts in some ASEAN countries. This diplomatic maneuver seems to have hit a wall except for the Philippines.

In a phone conversation in April, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Philippine Secretary of Foreign Affairs Teodoro Locsin Jr. expressed concerns with alleged Chinese maritime militia vessels in the South China Sea (SCS), calling on Beijing to abide by the 2016 arbitration ruling in favor of Manila. In July, following a visit by U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte restored the Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA) with the U.S.

The restoration of the VFA, which Duterte had previously threatened to terminate, signaled a victory by the Philippine armed forces top brass' partiality to the decades-old alliance with the U.S., which should be maintained, so they believe, as a deterrent to China. In effect, the Philippines' official stand is an endorsement for a deeper military cooperation with the U.S., including its Freedom of Navigation Operations in the SCS, which for years have constituted provocative acts on China.

But the Biden administration's success in the Philippines is enmeshed in a gridlock as far as other ASEAN countries are concerned. Singapore and Vietnam - two ASEAN countries visited by U.S. Vice President Kamara Harris in August - remain uncommitted to America's strategic security objectives against China. Beijing is the major trading partner of the two countries. Singapore keeps a balancing act with both the U.S. and China. Vietnam is engaged in bilateral talks with China to settle maritime disputes while maintaining close party-to-party solidarity ties.

Thailand's beneficial relations with China, especially in trade, investment and infrastructure development, make it averse to heeding Washington's hostile policy on China. Indonesia, the de facto leader of the ASEAN, has concerns similar to Thailand's and is laser-focused on domestic priorities, including the pandemic and the completion of infra projects in cooperation with Beijing.

Biden's attempt to win over ASEAN to its side against China is doomed to fail. Not only is China the region's major trading partner, but the economic future of the U.S. is tied to a harmonious relationship with the Asian giant.

For years, ASEAN countries have refused to be dragged into any feud between the two major powers as they pin their future on an environment of peace and neutrality. To emphasize this point, ASEAN in 1995 signed the Treaty of Southeast Asia Nuclear Weapon-Free Zone, where the member countries committed to keeping nuclear weapons out of the region. The treaty has been supported by China.

In effect, the regional organization, not the U.S., provides the stability in this part of the world, parrying any destabilizing pressure from the current superpower, which is not part of Asia. Pursuing this role, ASEAN is in continuing talks with China for the Code of Conduct for the SCS. Both parties have agreed that the talks should continue without any interference by a non-ASEAN country.

Nowhere is ASEAN's rejection of the U.S.'s gambit diplomacy more revealing than in their reactions to the recent formation of the new trilateral military alliance AUKUS (Australia, the UK and the U.S.) and the reactivation of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (QUAD) of the U.S., Australia, India and Japan.

This month, the Indo-Pacific AUKUS pact forged an arms deal to equip the Royal Australian Navy with multibillion-dollar worth nuclear-powered submarines. Majority of ASEAN countries, led by Indonesia and Malaysia, warned about the destabilizing effect of AUKUS and the threat of an arms race."

Editor's note: Stephen Ndegwa is a Nairobi-based communication expert, lecturer-scholar at the United States International University-Africa, author and international affairs columnist. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily those of CGTN. The just opened China-Africa Economic and Trade Expo (CAETE) in China's Hunan Province marks yet another milestone in the bilateral partnership. Even amid the pandemic, the partners have been relentless in the pursuit of new horizons and in their quest for mutual development.

These are indeed unprecedented times, with China-Africa trade soaring even in the face of a grave global economic dispensation. On September 3, China's Foreign Affairs Ministry released a statement showing that trade between the two partners soared by 40.5 percent year on year in the first seven months of 2021, hitting a record high of $139.1 billion. Of particular importance is the fact that African products are now gaining acceptance in the Chinese market, with imports from Africa increasing by 46.3 percent to $59.3 billion during the January-July period. In addition, China's imports of agricultural produce from the continent, such as rubber, cotton and coffee, doubled compared to the same period last year. Nothing could be a better barometer of trust or endorsement of an investment location than Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). In addition to the deeply entrenched infrastructure development cooperation, which has witnessed a revolution in Africa's terrestrial and virtual connectivity, China's overall FDI in Africa hit $2.07 billion in the period under review. This shows that Chinese investors' appetite for risk in the continent is increasing as the latter proves its resilience even amidst adversity. It is the reason that the contract value of newly signed projects and volume of contract business by Chinese enterprises in Africa also recorded a significant increase over the pre-COVID-19 levels in 2019. This is the backdrop of the second biennial CAETE, which runs from September 26 to 29. The steadfastness of the two partners has seen their trade grow 20 times in the last decade, with China taking first position as Africa's biggest trading partner for the last 12 consecutive years.

1249,Understanding Hong Kong's economic recovery,"Editor's note: Bobby Naderi is a London-based journalist, guest contributor in print, radio and television, and documentary filmmaker. The article reflects the author's opinions, and not necessarily those of CGTN.

China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) has issued a report that says the region's business environment has recovered despite foreign-backed violence and U.S. economic suppression.

The ""Report on Hong Kong's Business Environment: A Place with Unique Advantages and Unlimited Opportunities"" states that this is largely due to the implementation of the national security law and the fact that the HKSAR relied on the advantages of ""One Country, Two Systems"" principle in order to regain social stability and recover business environment, hence creating conditions for economic recovery.

According to this new report, the financial market is improving as well. In the 12 months ending June this year, the amount of IPO funds raised increased by more than 50 percent, and the turnover of HKSAR stocks increased by nearly 70 percent.

This has been backed by a survey conducted by the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce, which says over 60 percent of the interviewed companies believe that the national security law as well as the reform and opening-up of the Chinese economy have had a positive impact on their businesses.

In similar fashion, the latest Global Financial Center Index report released by research institutes shows that HKSAR's overall ranking has returned to the top three in the world. The financial market has been relatively less affected by the pandemic, thanks to a series of support measures, including a digital economy that implements digital legislation and promotes standardized and innovative development through 5G technology and network.

Let's face it. Hong Kong could only be where it is now as per the letter and spirit of the ""One Country, Two Systems"" principle and the national security law that promotes and sustains public participation and safety through progressive reforms.

For all the economic and social problems they may have experienced, many people continue to support their government and elected officials. They are against foreign interference in the city's internal affairs and those who commit subversion and national security offences.

The region's business environment recovery is important to not only the mainland but also the rest of the world. As an offshore financial center, the HKSAR is key for China's inbound and outbound investment and financing. Beyond funding, the region is China's most important springboard for foreign direct investment.

In essence, this can be attributed to the trust of Chinese and foreign firms on HKSAR's institutional framework as well as progressive reforms and funding pool for their investments. In the specific case of mergers and acquisitions, this has helped the territory to play a key role in facilitating Chinese companies' overseas acquisitions."
1250,Huawei's Meng Wanzhou: A victim of U.S.'s hegemony,"Editor's note: Dr. Allawi Ssemanda is the executive director of Ugandan-based foreign policy think tank Development Watch Center and author of ""Why Africa Deserves a Permanent Seat on United Nations Security Council"". The article reflects the author's opinions, and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

After spending almost three years under house arrest in Canada, Huawei Technologies Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou and her legal representatives reached an agreement with the U.S. Justice Department that allowed her to return home and leave the dungeon of psychological isolation endured during her house arrest.

Before she gained her freedom, Meng appeared in a court of Brooklyn via video link and pleaded not guilty to bank and wire fraud cases she was being accused of with claims that she tricked Hong Kong based HSBC bank which saw her Huawei transactions cleared by the bank which the U.S. Justice Department claims violated ""global financial institutions"" and Washington's sanctions against Iran.

Canadian officials had arrested Meng in Vancouver, Canada in December 2018 at the request of U.S. officials who later requested that Meng be extradited to the U.S. to face the charges.

Going forward, it is important to note that whatever reason Washington advances for Meng's arrest and extradition request, the arrest was political and against international laws. While the Justice Department alleges that Meng bypassed Washington's sanctions against Iran by concealing the relationship with a Huawei's subsidiary firm in Iran, such claims lack international laws backing.

First of all, Meng was dealing with HSBC about a business deal with Huawei and its subsidiary in Iran. Though it is true that the U.S. imposed secondary sanctions on companies dealing with Iran, it is also a fact that these are unilateral sanctions and are not based on international laws and cannot be equated with United Nations sanctions that all countries must observe.

Put differently, the above clearly shows that U.S.'s request to Canada to arrest Meng for having business deals conducted in Hong Kong-based bank is driven by U.S.'s libido dominandi – the urge to dominate the world and behavior of intimidating and bullying other countries to accept and stop business deals that have no direct connection with Washington.

The other reason that cannot be swept under the carpet is that Meng was just a victim of former U.S. President Donald Trump's political manoeuvre and his botched trade war against China. Trump is remembered to have launched what some analysts described as poorly thought decisions against China and consistently targeted Chinese firms including Huawei and also announced high trade tariffs against Chinese products in an effort many saw as trying to force Beijing into signing what Trump called fair trade agreements."

Editor's note: Andrew Korybko is a Moscow-based American political analyst. The article reflects the author's views and not necessarily those of CGTN.

The Asia-Pacific is the most economically significant region in the world, but it's also among its most volatile after the U.S. began to destabilize it as part of its grand strategic campaign to ""contain"" China. It was already troublesome enough that America started meddling in China's internal affairs in the Hong Kong Special Autonomous Region, the Taiwan region and the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, but it also created two complementary military alliances against China: the Quad between itself, Australia, India, and Japan, and AUKUS with Australia and the UK.

The second-mentioned one is especially dangerous because its flagship project aims to outfit Australia with a fleet of nuclear-powered submarines. As it presently stands, only those countries with nuclear weapons have been able to field such vessels, so this will be the first time that a non-nuclear-armed state will have them. Indonesia and Malaysia have warned that these risks may trigger a regional arms race, with Kuala Lumpur especially worried about a nuclear one.

AUKUS' nuclear dimension already seems to have emboldened Japan. Two of the contenders to lead Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party following incumbent Prime Minister Yoshihide Suge's decision not to seek re-election at the end of this month, former Foreign Minister and Defense Minister Taro Kono and former Minister of Internal Affairs and Communications Sanae Takaichi, are in favor of exploring the possibility of their country's own nuclear-powered submarine fleet.

What's so disturbing about their interest in these systems is that Japan is the only country to have suffered from nuclear attacks, which were launched against it by its now-American ally in the final days of World War II. The Japanese public is therefore extremely sensitive about all nuclear-related issues, especially after the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster. Furthermore, Japan is supposed to follow a policy of pacifism per its post-war constitution, yet wanting to field a fleet of nuclear-powered submarines suggests a return to militancy."
1256,Facts of U.S. meddling in Hong Kong laid bare,"Editor's note: Stephen Ndegwa is a Nairobi-based communication expert, lecturer-scholar at the United States International University-Africa, author and international affairs columnist. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

As the United States becomes increasingly desperate to hold on to a hegemonic past that is fast fading away, it is also becoming more blatant in its quest to maintain the status quo. The U.S.'s version of intervention has done more harm than good to the world, having been based on achieving objectives that have nothing or little to do with its hosts or partners.

However, the rise of China is a phenomenon that gives the U.S. extreme anxiety. The superpower is hell bent on using all means possible to clip the wings of its formidable geopolitical rival. The strategy involves attacking the country's legitimate interests in order to weaken the object of its envy from the roots.

As is currently happening in China's Taiwan region, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) is one of the sites that the U.S. has identified for a fight in its quest for dominance both in the Asia-Pacific and Indo-Pacific regions. In its usual posturing as a human rights defender and democracy advocate, the country has instigated unrest in the HKSAR in the last few years. On September 24, the U.S., Japan, India and Australia held their first summit in an attempt to undermine China's influence in the Indo-Pacific region.

It had disrupted quite a bit of HKSAR's governance, but the HKSAR has grown more resilient under the leadership of the Chinese government. The success of the recent voting of the 2021 Election Committee's subsector ordinary elections is testament of the maturity ""One Country, Two Systems"" principle. Contrary to ugly scenes witnessed in the U.S.-style electoral politics elsewhere, the HKSAR elections were devoid of bickering and other instances of contestation, which authorities said marks transition from chaos to governance.

It was a good time to finally lift the lid of the U.S.'s deception. On September 24, China's Foreign Ministry released ""Fact Sheet: U.S. Interference in Hong Kong Affairs and Support for Anti-China, Destabilizing Forces."" The new document gives a chronological order of events, leaving no doubt who is the bad boy in all these disputes.

The document highlights more than 100 instances in five key areas of the U.S.'s intervention. The first is the U.S. Congress' passing of anti-Hong Kong legislation like the Human Rights and Democracy Act of 2019 and the Hong Kong Autonomy Act of 2020. The second is the slapping of sanctions, with 14 items cited in the fact sheet since May 29, 2020, after the U.S. revoked HKSAR's special status and preferential economic treatment."

Editor's note: Hamzah Rifaat Hussain, former visiting fellow at the Stimson Center in Washington and former assistant researcher at the Islamabad Policy Research Institute, is a TV anchor at Indus News in Pakistan. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN. Of the many global issues discussed at the 76th session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA), the Israeli-Palestinian conflict came into the limelight once again. As both Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and Israeli Ambassador to the UN Gilad Erdan issued ultimatums and counter claims which widened trust deficits and made any chances of durable peace elusive, positions were consolidated as leaderships were emboldened into utter defiance.

The intractable nature of the decades-long conflict which has affected thousands of lives in the territories and imperiled the security of the Middle East at large is largely due to American lopsided diplomacy in the region which has been an obstacle to peace. It was noteworthy then that Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas called for an ""International Peace Conference"" while addressing UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres instead of an American-led peace initiative which has repeatedly failed and underlined brewing skepticism of any future Biden outreach to Palestine and the administration's ability to broker sustainable peace between the two sides. One can hark back to the brutal humanitarian crisis which unfolded in May 2021 where the inability to adopt an impartial, rational and ethical approach to the situation resulted in immeasurable suffering of Palestinians who have increasingly viewed American commitments to multilateralism and humanitarianism with great incredulity. The fact that the 2021 UNGA session now witnessed yet another stalemate on the Israeli-Palestinian issue is largely due to American indifference to human rights violations and its controversial status as a peace broker on the world stage. Key insights from countries which are averse to one-sided foreign policies neglecting human suffering and have a history of peacemaking and peace building both in the Middle East and beyond can provide valuable strategic input towards resolution of the dispute. In light of this, the proposed ""International Peace Conference"" could possibly be the only platform to resolve the conflict as a UN-backed multilateral deliberative forum.

1258,Future China-Canada relations depend on Canada being independent,"Editor's note: CGTN's First Voice provides instant commentary on breaking stories. The daily column clarifies emerging issues and better defines the news agenda, offering a Chinese perspective on the latest global events. The release and return of Meng Wanzhou to China breaks a three-year impasse that has plagued relations between Beijing and Ottawa. The Huawei CFO was subject to trumped up, politicized charges from a U.S. administration that goaded Canada into doing its bidding to the detriment of the China-Canada relationship. What now? The drama of course speaks a truth that has been known a long time, that Canada is overtly subservient to the United States in its own international relations, even when it is not in its national interests to do so. It has emulated Washington's strategic hostility towards China, and left analysts questioning whether even after Meng's release, relations might remain stagnant in the cold. Canada doesn't have a China problem so to speak, it has an American problem. China and Canada have good reasons prior to be on friendly terms. Canada is home to one of the largest overseas Chinese diasporas in the world, a total of 1.77 million, or 5 percent of the total population. There is no other country in the English-speaking world that holds such a population size. The two countries were also import bilateral trade partners.

Yet by weaponizing Huawei and Meng, the U.S. sought to articulate China as an enemy of Canada and Ottawa's liberal, pro-U.S. establishment inevitably fell into this trap as Beijing moved to defend its own interests in the wake of a prominent figure being arrested at America's request. Canada and its apologists repeatedly insisted that Meng's arrest was conducted ""in line with the rule of law,"" but the U.S. had no commitment to the rule of law whatsoever. Former President Donald Trump openly stated that she was a bargaining chip. China had no reason to believe that the arrest of Meng was being conducted in good faith, yet despite this Canada continually insisted it had ""done nothing wrong"" and failed in every single instance to criticize Washington's behavior in causing this international incident. They wholesale bought into the ""China threat"" mantra instead. The United States, in order to legitimate its own broader geopolitical agenda against China, needed a justification to make countries ""take sides"" with it when they would not otherwise do so. And Canada took the side. As a result, if relations between China and Canada are to progress from this impasse, Canada must pursue a path of self-reflection and soul-searching. If it decides to take on China solely on behalf of the United States as it did with Meng Wanzhou, it will lose – both in the battle and in the overall international relations. It has nothing to win from being Washington's puppet. If Canada chooses to pursue a more independent foreign policy based on balance and neutrality, with respect for China's interests and people, both parties can prosper and move forwards.

Editor's note: Thomas O. Falk is a London-based political analyst and commentator. He holds a Master of Arts in international relations from the University of Birmingham and specializes in U.S. affairs. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN. After 16 years of Angela Merkel as chancellor, Germany held its general election, hoping to find a successor who could fill her shoes. However, even with most of the results in, German politics will face one particular conundrum over these next months: uncertainty on several levels.

Only a year ago, the election appeared already decided. Merkel's Christian Democratic Union (CDU) was leading all polls significantly, with the Social Democratic Party (SDP) trailing by double figures. Moreover, assuming that the Greens would be its main competitor for the election win, the CDU's strategy first focused on Annalena Baerbock, allowing Social Democrat candidate Olaf Scholz to establish himself. What followed were various mistakes by the CDU and its campaign, beginning with the decision of taking Armin Laschet over Markus Soeder as chancellor candidate, who – to this day – possesses significantly higher approval ratings in Germany compared to Laschet. These mistakes paired with Laschet failing with his bid to present himself as the male version of Merkel and an unfortunate viral video of him during Germany's recent flooding disaster paved the way for Social Democrats and significantly damaged Laschet's candidacy and – according to the current results, a mere second place. And here is where Germany's problems start. A two-party coalition will not suffice for the first time in its post-World War II history. The most likely scenario is hence a coalition of three parties, which poses a conundrum in itself since the now most likely coalition – the Social Democrats, the Greens and the Free Democratic Party – will be faced with finding common ground despite diametrically opposed visions on taxes, immigration, social security and on how to address climate change. For these reasons alone, one can expect Angela Merkel to remain in a caretaker role for the foreseeable future, as negotiations starting with exploratory talks and then coalition negotiations will likely take months. Moreover, entering these negotiations alone is no guarantee for success. In 2017, Germany's previous general election, exploratory talks were held between CDU, the Free Democratic Party and Greens from October to November, only for the Free Democrats to pull out over irreconcilable differences with the Greens.

Editor's note: James Rae, a professor at California State University Sacramento, was a Fulbright Scholar at Beijing Foreign Studies University from 2017 to 2018. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN. Sino-American relations have been fragile for a decade or more, and face numerous and growing areas of complication. Despite harsh rhetoric toward China, the first two years of Donald Trump's presidency saw amiable personal and diplomatic encounters between the two nations and leaders. The tide turned in the spring of 2018, when the United States levied tariffs on billions of dollars of imports from China. From there, the Trump administration applied comprehensive political attacks on China across diplomatic, commercial, and security realms. No decision better symbolized the assault on China's development than the arrest of Huawei's chief financial officer (CFO) Meng Wanzhou on an American indictment during a visit to Canada in December of that year.

The arrest is a notable affront for several reasons. The indictment offered virtually no direct evidence of criminal behavior and was dated from conversations held years before between Huawei's leadership team and a private British bank. It was clearly motivated to provide a high-profile victim for the Trump administration's goal to look tough on China rather than any natural legal process. Moreover, the U.S. arrest warrant claimed that Huawei violated American sanctions on Iran. The U.S. attempt to apply the shameful practice of extraterritoriality has long been renounced in international law and is a legacy of colonial era arrogance repackaged in recent decades by American hegemonic ambitions to apply its own internal standards to other countries' diplomatic preferences. We can trace this back decades, even the 1996 Helms-Burton Act in the U.S. sought to place sanctions on any country in the world that did business with Cuba. Finally, if the U.S. wants to violate established norms of international law to prosecute its diplomatic goals of isolating Iran and ensnare foreign commercial enterprises in such efforts (i.e. ZTE, Huawei), it should not do so by ruining the lives of individual people. The brazen and outrageous act of Meng's three-year house arrest is unimaginable if a French, Dutch or even a Russian company had also violated the American domestic law. Would the U.S. have indicted, or Canada arrested, a European woman of such high profile? Perhaps, but more likely this whole affair reflects the mistreatment and belittling approach American foreign policy makers still hold toward Asia broadly and China specifically.

He is a Fulbright recipient at the University of Maryland, the U.S., and a former assistant researcher at Islamabad Policy Research Institute. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

As leaders of Australia, India, Japan and the United States met in Washington for their first in-person meeting, perhaps the grouping's only measure of history is this transition: from virtual to in-person.

Otherwise, a Friday joint statement from Quad leaders finds their ""path-breaking"" COVID-19 vaccine partnership shot down to pledges, more ""rules-based"" posturing to threaten maritime stability in the Pacific, and loud pronouncements on denuclearization, democracy and smart technologies without significant traction or demonstrated peace-building leverage.

""Together, we recommit to promoting the free, open, rules-based order, rooted in international law and undaunted by coercion, to bolster security and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific and beyond,"" stated the leaders. Firm emphasis on ideology to advance contested regional goals is the very definition of coercion.

Consider the preposterous notion that the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) – the gold-standard for addressing peace, stability and dispute sensitivities in the South China Sea – is upheld by the Quad's so-called championship of the ""maritime rules-based order.""

What escapes the alliance once again is the fact that UNCLOS cannot be weaponized in the Pacific to effectively disregard the region's territorial integrity, complimented in part by developments beyond the Quad's toxic rules-based discourse: sustained momentum for a South China Sea Code of Conduct by all relevant parties, and the demonstrated weight of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) on non-interference.

The latter is particularly relevant to Friday's joint statement. After all, the Quad's support for ASEAN's unity is predicated on the assumption that ASEAN's regional outlook in the Pacific has favorable overlap with what the Quad insists must be seen as ""the heart of the Indo-Pacific region."" Another sign that the Quad's maritime security overreach is undergirded by imagined realities.

Interestingly, lofty promises of the recent past – such as reliable COVID-19 vaccine supply targets for Southeast Asia and claimed Quad expertise on health security – also fall flat. By the alliance's own admission, some 79 million vaccines have been supplied to countries in the Indo-Pacific so far.

That is only a fraction of progress towards the Quad's one-billion vaccine supply target set for the broader Asia by 2022's year-end. Unmet expectations on supply chains for vaccine production add to an immediate reality check: the Quad's controversial vaccine diplomacy campaign is in dire need of sober introspection, not persistent overconfidence.

Informed critics sensed such trendlines as coming. A key weakness is the Quad's direct and implied opposition towards China – its technological genius, its anti-pandemic interventions, its diversification of assistance in the Pacific. All of which ensure that any Quad commitment on multilateralism, universal rights and shared values would be all but tethered to containment."
1263,Release of Meng ends a contemptible mess of illegality,"Editor's note: Radhika Desai is a professor of political studies at the University of Manitoba in Canada. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

The release of Meng Wanzhou, chief financial officer of Huawei, from her detention in Vancouver and her immediate return to China end a complex saga that would fill multiple volumes.

They would concern the U.S.'s underhand moves to meet the technological and competitive challenge of Huawei, particularly on 5G technologies. They would detail the U.S.'s mixed and ambiguous motivations concerning China. It would further involve Canada's own entanglement in tense relations between its two biggest economic partners. All this before we even got to the details of the case against Meng. Here we can only make a few limited but critically important points.

Let's start with the deeply problematic circumstances of Meng's arrest. Since the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York issued an arrest warrant on August 22, 2018, Meng had traveled through many countries with an extradition treaty without being arrested.

The reason was simple. Extradition is only possible when the crime on which Meng was charged was also a crime in the country through which Meng was traveling. ""Fraud and conspiracy to commit fraud to circumvent U.S. sanctions on Iran"" was not a crime in these countries.

Moreover, that charge arises from unilateral (and therefore, we must mention here, illegal) sanctions imposed by the U.S. on Iran. It is hardly news that these sanctions, and U.S. efforts to make them stick, have constituted illegal harassment of not only Iran, but also many U.S. allies. So, the first point we must underline is that the very basis of the arrest is illegal.

Moreover, without such illegal sanctions, even if the alleged ""fraud"" had been committed, it would be a matter between the ""fraudster"" and the entity ""defrauded"" and would, at worst, have involved a comparatively small fine. In these circumstances, a new charge was needed and was concocted: that Meng, a Chinese national, had lied to a British bank, HSBC, in Hong Kong.

Since the alleged crime was committed by a foreign national on foreign soil against a foreign institution, the U.S. could only claim standing to charge Meng because her allegedly fraudulent transaction would have passed through U.S. servers for some nanoseconds. This reasoning would normally be a joke in bars frequented by lawyers."
1264,Donald Trump to blame for Meng Wanzhou's ordeal,"Editor's note: Anthony Moretti is an associate professor at the Department of Communication and Organizational Leadership of Robert Morris University. The article reflects the author's views and not necessarily those of CGTN.

Meng Wanzhou is home. She should blame Donald Trump for the unnecessary and stressful ordeal she had to endure over the past couple of years.

To understand this disastrous geopolitical story, you need to remember several important points.

First, Donald Trump hates China; that was clear when he was U.S. president and it continues today, though because he is no longer in the White House few people care about his nonsensical ramblings. Whether it was tariffs, his rhetoric about coronavirus, promoting the reckless ""China Initiative"" or seeking to deny Chinese students the chance to study in the U.S., Trump was a one-man wrecking crew when it came to undermining China-U.S. relations.

Therefore, when Trump demanded his Department of Justice build a worthless case against Meng, no one should have doubted his real intent: He wanted to provide another example of his hatred of China. And because Meng was the Chief Financial Officer of a company he despised and the daughter of the company founder, she was the perfect pawn in his game.

That brings us to the second point: Trump wanted to destroy Huawei. Trump fully embraced the idea that Huawei was a tool of the Chinese government, a multinational telecommunications powerhouse that was eager to spy on its customers and then share whatever data it had collected with Chinese government. In reality, Trump would not accept that Huawei created solid products that attracted many Western nations and customers. Instead, he saw deception where there was none. Trump undermined Huawei's ability to further develop and sell its cellphones by cutting off the supplies of chips and other software it had regularly purchased from American companies.

While Trump did not succeed in decimating Huawei, he did damage the company's short-term prospects and, perhaps more importantly, its international reputation. A top Huawei official admitted this week that fewer Huawei phones are on the market because of the various sanctions ordered by Trump. To date, U.S. President Joe Biden has not eased up on the sanctions. And keep it in mind that Trump caused the founder of Huawei many sleepless nights knowing his daughter remained under house arrest in Canada; the psychological toll this took on Meng and her father is something Trump would have enjoyed."

Editor's note: Bradley Blankenship is a Prague-based American journalist, political analyst and freelance reporter. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

The U.S.-EU Trade and Technology Council in Pittsburgh will go ahead as per schedule on September 29, the European Commission confirmed amid speculations of the event's cancellation over a recent spat between the United States and France.

Draft memos leaked to various media outlets suggest that the two sides are quite split on key trade and technology areas, but might the European Union (EU) be poised to lead the conversation this time around?

Recent events suggest that this is entirely possible, as a read-out from a recent phone call between U.S. President Joe Biden and French President Emmanuel Macron made clear.

Buried in this joint statement was one extremely interesting sentence, ""The United States also recognizes the importance of a stronger and more capable European defense, that contributes positively to transatlantic and global security and is complementary to NATO.""

Macron has long criticized NATO, famously saying that the organization is going brain dead and that Europe needs to think of itself as a geopolitical power. He has since been more concrete, saying that Europe should start to handle its own defense independently without taking signals from Washington – though this was when Donald Trump was at the helm of affairs in the U.S.

The latest spat between the U.S. and France over a secretly negotiated nuclear submarine deal with Australia that angered Paris, however, saw France describe the situation as no different than how things went with Trump and only deepened French leadership's call for EU strategic autonomy.

The clear read of the background leading up to this latest spat, how it played out and how it was apparently resolved between Washington and Paris is that the U.S. side acquiesced to Macron's desire to see Europe deepen its strategic autonomy. While there is certainly nothing concrete officially in the works, there's little doubt that hinting at this in a joint statement gives Paris – and Europe itself – significant leverage in further negotiations with Washington.

That's why the upcoming U.S.-EU Trade and Technology Council in Pittsburgh could be an extraordinary opportunity for the EU to assert itself on key issues, even if the U.S. side wants to hijack the forum with anti-Chinese sentiment.

For starters, the EU could certainly use this opportunity to pressure the U.S. side into modernizing its regulations on Big Tech companies. A draft memo seen by Reuters suggests that this will be a major issue, but it seems unlikely that a unified approach will be nearly as ambitious as the EU side would like under the status quo.

As of now, both sides can agree on their need to combat anti-competitive practices and moderate content – but industry groups in Washington are staunchly opposed to adopting European-style data regulations, saying that harmonizing regulations with the EU would destroy the industry and instead that both sides should align on China."
1266,Meng Wanzhou's return shows the strong will of China,"Editor's note: The following article is taken from the Chinese-language ""The Real Point."" The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

Thanks to the unremitting efforts by the Chinese government, Meng Wanzhou, Chief Financial Officer of Huawei, who had been illegally detained by Canada for 1,028 days, returned to China on a chartered flight organized by the Chinese government on September 24 local time.

Her regaining freedom is not only a victory for justice and jurisprudence, but also a clear demonstration of the firm determination of China's ruling party and government to safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of its citizens and the strong will of the Chinese people to defy threats and oppose hegemony.

In December 2018, Canadian authorities detained Meng Wanzhou, who was in transit at Vancouver International Airport, at the request of the United States. Subsequently, the U.S. government requested Meng's extradition to the United States for trial on the grounds of so-called ""wire fraud."" The Canadian side ignored the fact that Meng had not violated any Canadian law and unjustifiably and illegally detained her for more than 1,000 days.

Obviously, this is an outright political frame-up and a political persecution of a Chinese citizen planned by the United States and carried out by Canada as an accomplice. Under the guise of the law, the United States and Canada have been in fact trying to hobble Chinese high-tech companies and hold back China's technological development. This was reinforced by the fact that in the subsequent court hearings, the United States could not make a case for its charges.

For example, the Canadian judge in charge of the case repeatedly raised questions, saying that the United States' accusations against Meng were ""unclear"" and ""unusual."" In addition, the evidence at the trial showed that HSBC played an extremely disgraceful role in cooperating with the United States to frame Huawei by maliciously setting Meng up, piecing together materials and fabricating incriminating evidence.

As the truth transpires, many well-informed people in Canada have called on the Canadian government to terminate the extradition process for Meng.

For Meng, more than 1,000 days and nights in detention have been filled with torment, but her strength and resilience have been very impressive. She was supported by the persistent efforts of the Chinese government and the solidarity demonstrated by the Chinese people. These were crucial to her eventual release."
1267,Fact Sheet signals pushback against U.S.,"Editor's note: Zhu Zheng is an assistant professor focusing on constitutional law and politics at China University of Political Science and Law. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

On September 24, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China (MFA) issued a Fact Sheet, listing 102 examples of U.S. interference in the affairs of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR). This criminal record of the U.S. interfering in Hong Kong affairs and undermining the region's prosperity and stability openly accuses Washington of violating ""basic norms governing international relations.""

The list says more than it appears. Its importance and meaning cannot be properly grasped unless unfolded in the following perspectives.

First of all, regarding the recent U.S.-China diplomatic wrestling, observers speculated that the statement sends out an unequivocal message that the issues concerning Hong Kong should be crossed out in the future talks between China and the U.S., if there is such a meeting.

Indeed, U.S. Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry on September 22 said that he plans to come back to China and is confident that the presidents of China and U.S. will meet, though he has no idea when this will happen. This indicates that some politicians in the Biden administration sincerely look forward to this meeting.

According to the MFA's Fact Sheet, if the meeting is to take place, the U.S. should at least stop engaging in the accused conduct and change its policy towards Hong Kong. In this sense, the new document sets a minimum condition for the normal diplomatic relationship to restore.

Secondly, in this long list of criminal record, China not only exposes America's malicious acts, but also forcefully rebuts the U.S. smearing of the ""One Country, Two Systems"" principle.

By all means, the statement provides a different perspective for the Hong Kong citizens to understand how the region's affairs have been interfered by foreign forces and the subtle attitude that the U.S. holds toward the previous British colonial city."
1268,China stands up for its citizens who are victimized by foreign powers,"Editor's note: CGTN's First Voice provides instant commentary on breaking stories. The daily column clarifies emerging issues and better defines the news agenda, offering a Chinese perspective on the latest global events.

One company can't fend off the state apparatus of another country bending on taking it down; but a nation can.

Meng Wanzhou as an individual and Huawei as a company cannot confront the entire intelligence, legal and political power of the U.S. government. From the beginning, China identified the political nature of the charges leveled against Meng. The country stood by her, taking strong, proportional measures to ensure her release and counter the desperate efforts to bully China by holding one of its business executives hostage.

China's efforts succeeded. In the end, Meng was convicted of no crime, will pay no penalty, and the only sentence she received is having nearly three years of her life taken away from her as China fought through the unsustainable and politically motivated charges. Meng was flown home on a jet chartered by the Chinese government.

Meng was ultimately a pawn in the U.S. war against not only Huawei, but also China's technological advancement. Even after her release, politics permeates her case. Republican Senator Marco Rubio said, ""The release of Ms. Meng raises serious questions about President Biden's ability and willingness to confront the threat posed by Huawei and the Chinese Communist Party."" Republican Senator Tom Cotton admitted this was all a political game, saying ""President Biden folded."" And Republican Senator Bill Hagerty claimed that the U.S. has ""given up leverage today.""

For years, the U.S. has been on an extraordinary campaign against telecom giant Huawei, a symbol of China's rapid technological advances. Prior to concerted attacks on Huawei by the Trump administration, the company was a leader in the global mobile phone market, selling more phones than Apple. However, the U.S. pressured allies not to use Huawei's advanced 5G telecom technology, alleging without any factual basis and in contrast to the opinions of British security experts that China could use it to intercept communications. Its offensive on the company, including banning sales of components to the company, forced it to sell off parts of its thriving business."
1269,Huawei & Alstom: A tale of two companies,"Editor's note: In 2013, French industrial conglomerate Alstom's executive Frederic Pierucci was arrested, and Alstom was then ""dismembered"" by the U.S. Five years later, Huawei's CFO Meng Wanzhou gets arrested, and Washington attempts to ban the Chinese telecom giant around the world. Britain has followed suit. Now that Meng has returned to China, it is valuable to look at the parallel between the companies and how America traps its tech ""prey."" This is a republication of an episode from CGTN Insight originally published on July 14, 2020, at the height of America's suppression against Huawei.

On April 14, 2013, Frederic Pierucci's life was forever changed. He was an executive of Alstom, a French power and transportation conglomerate, with a happy family and promising future.

On that day, he was arrested by the FBI when his plane landed at the John F. Kennedy International Airport, for his alleged role in a 2003-2004 corruption case involving Alstom in Indonesia.



Five years later, on December 2018, Meng Wanzhou, CFO of Huawei, China's telecom giant was arrested in Vancouver at the request of the U.S. on the charge of conspiracy to defraud multiple international institutions.

Later, both of them found their arrests were at the heart of a plot where America's judicial power seemed to be intertwined with the business world.



""They arrested me to put pressure on the CEO of Alstom. At that time, I was close to the president. Arresting me meant arresting the CEO himself. The U.S. Department of Justice put pressure on him to cooperate. He agreed to pay the most penalties under the FCPA at that time, more than 700 million U.S. dollars. He was forced to sell 70 percent of Alstom to its U.S. competitor, General Electric,"" Frederic Pierucci said in an interview with CGTN.

Once a symbol of France's industrial power, Alstom was ""dismembered"" by the Americans.

The Foreign Corrupt Practice Act was born 1977 as a domestic law to restrict American companies' corruption practices. But later the U.S. government found this put U.S. enterprises in a disadvantaged position in overseas competition.

Huge efforts were made to make this law international. Any company that has ""minimal contact"" with the U.S. comes under the law. This can include using U.S. dollars in contracts and sending an email via an American server.

But it looks like the act targets more European companies than American ones. Since it came into effect, of all the 29 companies who paid a penalty of more than 100 million dollars based on the act, 15 are from Europe, with only six from the U.S. Europe is not the only target. It is ready to take actions on a global scale.

Huo Zhengxin, Professor of law at China University of Political Science and Law pointed out that the U.S. has the hegemonic power on a global scale: ""I think the U.S. has weaponized American dollar, together with the international payment system, known as the SWIFT system. Therefore, any company in the world if it is doing business using U.S. dollars, it is under the supervision of the American authority. So I think that the American dominance in economy in currency together with its hegemony in other fields ensures the enforcement of the long-arm jurisdiction of American law.""

Countries need to fight corrupt practices. But the asymmetry of the way U.S. treats its own companies and foreign ones raises a valid question: How willing is the U.S. to employ its law as a weapon to achieve its political and economic goals? With Washington's global spy network, how many more companies will fall prey to the ""American trap?""

The answers to these questions are even clearer in the case of Huawei. The arrest of Meng was woven into a larger plan to crack down on Huawei, a world leader in 5G technology.

The weapon the U.S. used this time is its export control regulations.

Apparently, if America decides to impose sanctions on Iran, it would not like any other country to do business with the country. Otherwise it would face secondary sanctions from the U.S.

""Secondary sanctions violate international law. First, it does not have any basis on the jurisdiction of the international law. And more importantly, it violates the international rule of non-intervention. The principle is enshrined by the UN charter according to which every country has a right to conduct affairs without the external interference,"" explained Huo.

The U.S. tried to portray Meng's arrest as a pure legal case. But it was not from the start. According to a report revealed by Canada's spy agency, ""advanced communication to the Canadian Security Intelligence Service [regarding her arrest] came from the FBI.”

Meng's arrest and the issue of Huawei has been quickly used as leverage by the Trump administration in a tit-for-tat trade war that has lasted more than two years. By choking Huawei, the U.S. government is weakening Huawei's 5G dominance while making more demands in a China-U.S. trade deal.

Former U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has tried many times to unite different countries to join the Huawei ban front line, claiming Huawei equipment could be used for espionage by the Chinese government. As always, no evidence has ever been offered.

""There is a lot of evidence to show that the U.S. is using law to safeguard its foreign policies and the national interest. Nowadays, the U.S. regards China as a competitor, or a challenge to U.S. interest. Therefore, it uses its long arm jurisdiction to penalize or to prevent the development of Huawei, which is a high tech company of China. Although France is an ally of the United States, in order to it realize its economic interest the U.S. is not hesitant to use law to impose sanctions on a French company,"" Huo added.

The curtain has come down on the story of Alstom. But will Huawei become the next Alstom?

""I sincerely hope Huawei will not be the second Alstom. I think the major difference is, from what I'm seeing, Huawei can count on the support of the Chinese government,"" said Pierucci.

1270,"With Meng Wanzhou's release, can we return to adult diplomacy?","Editor's note: Keith Lamb is a University of Oxford graduate with an MSc degree in Contemporary Chinese Studies. His primary research interests are China's international relations and ""socialism with Chinese characteristics."" The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

The release of Meng Wanzhou has for many, including myself, come as quite a surprise. After the arbitrary detention of Julian Assange, for a number of years, I had assumed Meng's case would likewise just drag on indefinitely. After all, both of their detentions have been politically motivated by U.S. hegemonic ambitions.

Assange revealed the war crimes and corruption of U.S. imperialism while Meng happened to be the chief financial officer of Huawei, whose company, due to making superior and cost-effective products, became the target of then U.S. President Donald Trump's restrictions. As such, Assange represents a challenge to U.S. soft-power, which disseminates its cleansed version of reality where even atrocious wars can be sanitized. Meng, on the other hand, represents a technological challenge to U.S. hard-power essential for achieving superiority in the military realm. Both figures symbolize a challenge to the illusion of Western liberalism, which claims to be a bastion of free media and free-market competition.

Meng's case was weak from the start. If, just for argument's sake, we assume that Huawei had breached U.S. sanctions on Iran, then it was nevertheless vindictive to come after an individual in the company, when the entity to be prosecuted would be the company as a whole.

In addition, let us not forget, Huawei is a Chinese company and what it decides to do outside of the U.S. is not subject to U.S. extraterritoriality.

Considering Meng's arrest came at a time when Trump was pressuring both the Chinese government and Huawei, combined with the fact that Trump had hinted in the past Meng could be released if it was beneficial to a U.S.-Sino trade deal, just smacks of outright immature hostage diplomacy. Consequently, Meng's detention further undermines the U.S. and the West's self-styled image that their ""rule of law"" is above politics, and superior to all others. Continuing Meng's detention made a mockery of that Trump's capriciousness represented a departure from sensible U.S. administrations.

Meng's detention has been a needless thorn in the side of both Sino-U.S. and Sino-Canadian diplomacy. For current President Joe Biden, Meng's continued internment merely made him a passive bystander to Trump's excesses. With Meng's release, Biden, who is characterized as ""the adult in the room,"" will no doubt be quietly rejoicing that he doesn't have to prance through the charade any longer by pretending that Meng's house arrest was founded on innate U.S. justice. Of course, one may argue that U.S. justice is not so bad considering Meng has been cleared of all charges, even if the process did take three years."

Yuan has published several papers on China-U.S. security relations in Chinese academic journals and is a regular contributor to many Chinese media outlets. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

The leaders from United States, Japan, India and Australia convened the first-ever-in-person Quad summit on September 24. Born out of humanitarian cooperation on the Indonesian tsunami in 2004, the quadrilateral partnership seemed innocuous at first. But over the years, it has become a geopolitical weapon for the U.S. to prolong its hegemony in the Asia Pacific region. But given the divergences of interests and values among partners, it is doubtful what the Quad can deliver as it promises.

What can be delivered

The joint statement released after the summit touched on a variety of hot topics of the day. They ranged from global issues such as the COVID-19 pandemic, infrastructure, climate change and critical technologies to regional issues such as Afghanistan, the Democratic Republic of Korea and the East and South China Seas. It also announced a spate of new initiatives, including a new Quad infrastructure partnership, a semiconductor supply chain initiative and a Quad Fellowship on Science, technology, engineering and mathematics studies.

But instead of focusing on what it said, it is equally important to see what is actually deliverable. For example, the much-hyped semiconductor supply chain partnership might require chip-making countries, i.e., the U.S. and Japan, to share the critical technology with other partners.

But given the ""national security"" status of the critical technologies, it is doubtful that meaningful cooperation would result. In fact, the joint statement reiterated the goal of building ""habits of cooperation,"" which revealed the modest outcomes of the summit than anticipated.

More importantly, the Quad is not a formal alliance; its relevance is still in debate. As an adherent of the non-alignment movement, India has been hesitant to join a quasi-alliance with the U.S. Meanwhile, Japan is rejecting the notion of the Quad turning into NATO for Asia. It is also not wise for Australia to blindly bandwagon on the U.S. confrontation with other Pacific powers. Furthermore, the new trilateral AUKUS security partnership among the U.S., UK and Australia seems to be undercutting the Quad's influence.

Quad value cast into doubt

Aside from the question of relevancy, the Quad is running into a confidence crisis: ""democratic value."""
1272,Merkel's legacy and influence will not fade away,"Editor's note: Gu Xuewu is the chair of political science and international relations at the University of Bonn. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

After Germany's federal parliamentary elections on September 26, the Merkel government will remain in office in a caretaker role until a new cabinet is sworn in. As the transition, according to the country's past elections, normally takes up to three months, the world will soon see a new German chancellor take residence at the Bundeskanzleramt before this Christmas.

This will conclude the iron lady's 16-year career as the German chancellor and put an end to the Merkel era that has influenced Germany's and Europe's political landscapes, as well as the world order.

But while an era comes to its end, its influence does not. Merkel's political legacy will for a long time carry direct or indirect weight in policymaking in Germany and Europe as a whole. Germans, other Europeans and those outside the continent who closely follow German and European affairs will unconsciously take Merkel as a benchmark to gauge the performance of her successor as they are all but too familiar with her governing style, policy priorities and partners.

A role model to emulate or a subject of criticism, whichever she is taken for, the Merkel era will linger on without her until new challenges and crises crowd her name out of people's memory.

So what exactly is Merkel's political legacy for Germany, Europe and the world at large?

First, the East German scientist-turned politician will leave behind her a happy, contented German society. In a world of lurking crises, a raging pandemic and incessant conflicts, this is nothing less than a miracle. A number of polls show that over 70 percent Germans are happy or very happy with their own state of being and their country's development.

That is, although Merkel is not known for any grand seismic project as was Helmut Kohl, her political mentor, the architect of German reunification and former German chancellor, she has led the country out of one crisis after another with her nuanced leadership style and shrewd policy design, making Germany a relatively stable, affluent and happy country."
1273,Meng Wanzhou's release a victory for China and for justice,"Editor's note: Andy Mok is a research fellow at the Center for China and Globalization. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

On September 25, the United States Department of Justice made a decision which allowed Canada to drop its extradition proceedings against Huawei CFO, Meng Wanzhou.

This is great news for Meng, her family and Huawei. And it also may represent an opportunity for an improvement in China-U.S. relations. And it may allow China-Canada relations to improve as well.

Meng was wrongfully detained by Canada in 2018 under the direction of the United States in a brazen and mafia-like attempt to intimidate a leading Chinese technology company. Specifically then-U.S. president Donald Trump was looking for any means fair or foul to show he was tough on China without regard for whether these deeds (or misdeeds) had any moral or rational justification.

And perhaps succumbing to a fantasy where Trump saw himself as a sort of mafia boss, his administration decided to take Meng hostage. Unfortunately, Canada, however unwillingly, was also strong-armed into becoming an accomplice.

Fortunately for Meng and the cause of justice, this story dominated global media headlines and social media. While on the face of it, the crimes of which Meng was accused by the United States seemed plausible, her legal team quickly and easily showed that these charges were absolutely without merit.

For example, during the June 28-29 hearings, evidence from HSBC, which the U.S. claims was defrauded by Meng and hence the foundation of its charges against her, revealed relevant senior staff at HSBC were fully aware of the nature of the relationship between Huawei and Skycom and that the internal customer management system at HSBC listed Skycom as part of the ""Huawei Mastergroup,"" which demonstrates that HSBC had institutional knowledge of this relationship. As such, this evidence shows that U.S. case against Meng to be completely without merit.

But as is too often the case, in the face of a determined and biased adversary like the United States government, having the facts or justice on your side may not carry the day. Those still imprisoned in Guantanamo or who have suffered in the torture chambers at Bagram in Afghanistan or black sites around the world know this far too well.

But firstly Meng is a Chinese citizen and had the unwavering support of the Chinese government. Other countries might have balked at the thought of incurring the wrath or even displeasure of the United States. But China, as a strong and principled country, has shown that it would not be bullied.

Next, the media spotlight also played an important role in seeing that justice was ultimately achieved. The sustained global media attention made it impossible for the shoddiness of the charges against Meng to be ignored. And it also highlighted the sordid nature of this attempt to coerce Huawei. Without this sustained media coverage, however just Meng's case, it might have turned out quite differently."
1274,Business executives should not be afraid of traveling again,"Editor's note: CGTN's First Voice provides instant commentary on breaking stories. The daily column clarifies emerging issues and better defines the news agenda, offering a Chinese perspective on the latest global events.

The detention on Meng Wanzhou never should have happened – and a similar situation should never happen again.

International arrest warrants should be used for criminals, not for pawns in the political game of thrones. Business or even international ties of any sort between nations cannot function if business executives are targets for bogus charges to help pursue political goals.

The political nature of Meng's arrest was clear from the beginning. This could be seen from the flimsy nature of the charges, Meng's symbolic importance to China, and the context of the fraught political relations between the U.S. and China at that time. Then U.S. President Donald Trump made explicitly clear the political nature of the charges on December 11, 2018, shortly after Meng's arrest.

Speaking about the nascent trade war between China and the U.S., Trump told Reuters he would drop charges against Meng if China made trade concessions. ""If I think it's good for what will be certainly the largest trade deal ever made – which is a very important thing – what's good for national security – I would certainly intervene if I thought it was necessary,"" he said.

These comments outraged Canadians, who realized they had been duped into getting involved in a political feud under a legal pretext, and left no doubt Meng's arrest was political in nature. In the last few years, the United States has suddenly realized China is a rising power with an economy that will dwarf America over the next few decades. And instead of dealing with China's rise in a calm manner, it has panicked, flailing and thrashing like a drowning man."
1275,MOFA Fact Sheet: U.S. hostility towards HK exposed for all to see,"In recent years, China's achievements have surpassed all expectations, and the United States has become increasingly paranoid. It realizes its post-war hegemony can no longer be taken for granted, and that its star is slowly fading. Ever since the UK-based Center for Economics and Business Research reported in December 2020 that China will overtake the U.S. to become the world's largest economy by 2028, five years earlier than previously forecast, it has been panic stations in Washington D.C.

Editor's note: Grenville Cross is a senior counsel and professor of law, and was previously the director of public prosecutions of the Hong Kong SAR. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

The U.S., however, faces massive problems, and they are getting worse. It is burdened with a huge national debt, standing at $28.4 trillion in August, about $1.7 trillion more than a year earlier. Its foreign policy is a shambles, with the Afghanistan debacle being but the latest example, and even its closest allies are appalled by its incompetence and duplicity. Indeed, after the AUKUS deal between the U.S., Australia and the UK was sprung on an unsuspecting world on September 15, France, which was cheated out of a submarine contract, denounced it as a ""stab in the back"", and, for the first time ever, withdrew its ambassador from Washington D.C.

Instead, however, of taking a long, hard look at itself, the previous and present U.S. administrations have resorted to scapegoating China, hoping to deflect attention away from their own woes. Although most of its problems are of its own making, the U.S. has sought to blame China not only for its own ills but also those of the world, thereby laying the groundwork for hostile interventions. It has decided that one of the ways of dealing with China is by fomenting internal dissent and spreading misinformation about it, just as it has done in its efforts to weaken Russia.

On June 9, 2019, when the protest movement in Hong Kong and its armed wing declared war on society, ostensibly over the SAR government's fugitive surrender bill, the U.S. saw its chance. Although the proposals would have facilitated the return of criminal fugitives to 177 jurisdictions, subject to court oversight, and were entirely reasonable, the U.S., to inflame tensions, demonized them, and provided every encouragement to the protesters.

Indeed, on August 6, 2019, at the height of the violence in Hong Kong, the U.S. Consul General's political counselor, Julie Eadeh, met covertly with protest leaders, including Joshua Wong Chi-fung and Nathan Law Kwun-chung, at a local hotel, presumably to share U.S. views on the insurrection and provide ongoing advice.

Again, after Brian Leung Kai-ping, one of the rioters who trashed the Legislative Council complex on July 1, 2019, causing damage estimated at HK$50 million ($6.4 million), fled the city, he was not only welcomed to the U.S., but also invited to the Congress as an honored guest.

Instead of denouncing the rioters who were bringing death and destruction to Hong Kong streets, the then Secretary of State Mike Pompeo endorsed the protest movement's demands, supported their anti-police agenda, and sought to blame the government for the insurrection.

Even when the protest movement targeted the rule of law by firebombing the courts and threatening the judges, Pompeo and his cronies continued to lionize the protest leaders, and to whitewash their excesses. It was, by any yardstick, partisanship of the worst sort, and represented a new low in U.S. foreign policy.

Even when anti-China legislators, linked to the protest movement, sabotaged the work of the Legislative Council, preventing the passage of legislation for nearly seven months in 2019-20, the U.S. condemned the initiatives taken to get things back on track. Even though it would never have tolerated obstructionism of this type at home, it expected the authorities to allow it in Hong Kong, although the name of its game was, of course, mischief-making.

But with the exclusion of legislators bent on mayhem, and their replacement with responsible citizens committed to the well-being of Hong Kong and the national good, the city now has the prospect of effective governance."

Editor's note: Xin Ping is a commentator on international affairs, writing regularly for CGTN, China Daily and Global Times. He can be reached at xinping604@gmail.com. The article reflects the author's views and not necessarily those of CGTN. Lo and behold, a white officer wearing a cowboy hat on horseback is wielding his whip at a ragged and bare-handed man's head. This is not some Civil-War-era movie set where a slave owner is herding his slaves-like animals. Instead, this is what has happened on September 20, 2021 at U.S.-Mexico borders where a U.S. federal border guard was expelling a Haitian migrant.

Since last week, over 10,000 migrants, mostly from Haiti, which was struck by frequent earthquakes, COVID-19 pandemic and political upheavals, have been assembling and encamping under a bridge in Del Rio, Texas, and crossing back and forth between Mexico and the U.S. to sustain their lives. Without offering any temporary humanitarian assistance, the U.S. government reacted quickly to ""dump"" the liabilities by arranging flights repatriating the ""uninvited guests"" back to their home country, or more precisely, back to imminent humanitarian disaster and the verge of death. The prospect of deportations weighed heavily on the migrants who risked their lives traversing continents over months to reach their ""dreamland"" and were met with nothing but whipping in the face. A whip on the migrant is an embarrassment on the United States. For a man of moral conscience, such inhumane treatment defies both common sense and basic human decency. ""Promising"" commitments made by Joe Biden during his presidential campaign, such as reasserting America's commitment to asylum-seekers and refugees, tackling the root causes of irregular migration and implementing effective border screening, are being shredded right before public eyes. On taking office, Biden has begun reversing many of his predecessor's hardline immigration policies. In May, the administration extended temporary protected status for the 150,000 Haitians already living in the country, which was interpreted by many as a sign that the U.S. would be more welcoming to migrants. Widespread misinformation and high-profile political stunt have created a false sense of hope.

Editor's note: Zhou Wenxing is assistant professor at School of International Studies, Nanjing University. The article reflects the author's opinions, and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

China's Taiwan region submitted its application for the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) on September 22. Zhao Lijian and Zhu Fenglian, spokespersons for the Chinese Foreign Ministry and for the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council respectively, expressed stern warnings against the region's move and firmly rejected Taiwan's accession to any agreement or organization of official nature, urging that the one-China policy must be the precondition for China's Taiwan region's participation in regional economic cooperation.

There is no doubt that the CPTPP, a successor of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) Agreement drafted in 2015, is an agreement or organization of official nature. This trade pact was signed by 11 countries in March 2018, and became effective in that December. According to the latest statistics, the 11 signatories have now combined economies representing more than 13 percent of global gross domestic product, totaling at approximately $13.5 trillion.

The Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) in Taiwan has submitted a bid to join the trade pact in the name of ""promoting the commitment to free trade in Asia Pacific"" and ""improving mutual economic development and thus benefiting all people in the whole region and the world,"" quoting the remarks by the Taiwan leader Tsai Ing-wen.

But in effect, the move should be interpreted as a DPP attempt to achieve its political goal of ""seeking independence"" by economic means. In its eyes, accession to the regional economic arrangement would be beneficial to expand the island's so-called ""international space.""

The DPP's efforts to join the CPTPP are nevertheless very likely to fail because the island as part of China's territory is unqualified to apply. As China's core interest, the Taiwan issue has never been a topic for negotiation. Both the Chinese government and Chinese people would firmly reject the Taiwan region's participation in any official group unless it does so on the basis of the one-China policy."
1279,Manufacturing consent: What really happened in Wuhan?,"Editor's note: Keith Lamb is a University of Oxford graduate with an MSc degree in Contemporary Chinese Studies. His primary research interests are China's international relations and ""socialism with Chinese characteristics."" The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

""What Really Happened in Wuhan"" is a special report, recently aired by Sky TV. Its central claim is that the coronavirus, due to a lab leak, came from the Wuhan Institute of Virology. Running throughout this report is that it seeks to ""uncover the truth"" vis-à-vis China, which stands as a bad actor out to deceive the world.

Firstly, before dealing with the specifics of this report, the claim of a ""heroic free liberal media"" fighting undemocratic state power must be nipped in the bud. Sky being controlled by the transnational media tycoon Rupert Murdoch is, in fact, the antithesis of any such touted freedom and democracy. Indeed, the Murdoch empire, which spans across the U.S., Australia and the UK (AUKUS), whipped up support for both the undemocratic invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan, which could never have been carried out without a tsunami of disinformation.

As such, considering China is the new focus of transnational liberal disinformation and limits the power of undemocratic monopoly capital, which Sky represents, one must be skeptical of any narrative that sets a ""free media"" controlled by an oligarch, whose interests are for profit against China, whose interests are for socialist progress.

With this in mind, the specific claims made by the report are somewhat confusing in part because they largely arise from opinions rather than scientific evidence: all scientific evidence being controlled by China can't be trusted, and even the World Health Organization (WHO), made up largely of Western funding, including that of Bill Gates, and full of Western cadres, for the same reason, cannot be trusted.

In contrast, former U.S. President Donald Trump and former Secretaries of State Mike Pompeo, who both star in the report, are now trustworthy actors. Trump's ""evidence"" that the virus emanated from the Wuhan lab boils down to ""common sense"" but he's hard-pressed to give specific scientific evidence. I would suggest, to the former president, that ""common sense"" often boils down to creating a consensus through the media. For example, the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq were both ""common sense"" after indoctrination too.

Pompeo believes there is ""enormous evidence"" to support the lab-leak thesis going back to the summer. However, is he aware that there is scientific evidence that traces the coronavirus back to the North of Italy, in the region where a cluster of U.S. army bases are located?

Then there are the widely reported ""mysterious vaping deaths"" and flu symptoms in the U.S., wiping out elderly care homes around the American military base Fort Detrick, which is postulated as another source of the COVID-19 outbreak.

The Sky report is full of speculation. For example, Wei Jingsheng, who is introduced as a top-level whistleblower, bizarrely claims with zero evidence that he got secret information from an unknown source that China purposely spread the virus at the Wuhan Military World Games in October 2019. To be fair, the report doesn't dwindle long on this claim and even Trump dismisses it. Nevertheless, despite lacking scientific evidence the claim stays in for the purpose of creating a negative consensus towards China.

Within the report, there are some concrete claims about the scientific ongoings of the Wuhan lab. For example, it is claimed that Shi Zhengli, a leading Chinese virologist working at the lab who collected bat viruses and brought them back to Wuhan, has to take the blame for the coronavirus lab leak. It is speculated that one virus RaTG13, which is said to be 96.2 percent similar to the COVID-19 virus, could have been used to create the latter."

Editor's note: Andrew Korybko is a Moscow-based American political analyst. The article reflects the author's views and not necessarily those of CGTN.

Last week's announcement of the new Australia-UK-U.S. (AUKUS) trilateral military alliance, which most observers agree is aimed at ""containing"" China, has caused serious concern among the Pacific Island States (PIS). These sparsely populated but sometimes geographically vast countries fear being pressured by those Anglosphere nations into closely cooperating with this zero-sum bloc. These concerns aren't unfounded either owing to historical reasons, some of their military statuses, and recent developments.

The U.S. came to control three North Pacific Island nations after World War II: the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of the Marshall Islands and the Republic of Palau. It then carried out many nuclear tests in this region, devastating its ecology and causing health problems for the locals.

All three have since obtained independence but were coerced into agreeing to something called the ""Compact of Free Association (COFA)."" This gave the U.S. the control over defense policies of these countries and the right to operate its forces on their territories.

As for the South Pacific Island nations, they remained within Australia and the UK's ""sphere of influence"" after World War II, with Papua New Guinea directly controlled by Canberra until 1975. These countries have recently expanded their economic ties with China, which Australia exploited as the basis for its fearmongering about the intentions of the People's Republic of China. Its media also spread fake news about an alleged Chinese naval base in Vanuatu. In 2018, Papua New Guinea allowed Australia and the U.S. to use its Lombrum Naval Base.

The state of affairs is that AUKUS will likely seek to expand its military sway in the PIS, which it regards as being within its exclusive ""spheres of influence."" The problem is that the South Pacific states don't want to become AUKUS' playground because they don't consider China to be their enemy.

To the contrary, China is regarded as a major developmental partner through its Belt and Road Initiative and a key ally in the global crusade against the climate change that most directly affects their security."

1282,Biden turns to spies after scientists give 'wrong' answer on lab leak,"Nearly two years on from the emergence of COVID-19, the debate over its origins rages on with no definitive answers.

Did it jump from animals to humans, was it caused by a lab leak or is there another explanation?

Let's weigh the evidence.

The lab leak hypothesis contains some very serious allegations and several strands.

First, there is the claim that China is not being transparent and must be hiding something. And if China is hiding something, so the logic goes, there must have been a lab leak.

But is China hiding things? Not according to the international team of scientists sent to Wuhan to investigate the origins of COVID-19.

The team says it was given access to everywhere it wanted to go. It went to the main market where the virus spread from. It met with the doctors that treated the first patients, and the staff of the Wuhan Institute of Virology. It even got to look at raw data such as the early case database.

""We went on tours around the labs, not just one, but many labs in Wuhan. And we looked for the sorts of things you'd look for,"" WHO team member Peter Daszak said earlier.

No matter how much data the team collected, it seems critics will never be satisfied.

Second, there are allegations that there's a ""smoking gun"" – biological proof that the virus that causes COVID-19 was genetically engineered.

This allegation stems from a widely read article in which Nobel laureate David Baltimore says the virus' furin cleavage site appears to be genetically engineered.

But Professor Baltimore has backed down from this claim, and other biologists showed he was dead wrong. The intelligence review ordered by U.S. President Joe Biden found no evidence the virus was created in a lab or engineered by humans.

Third, there is the circumstantial argument, based on a seemingly uncanny coincidence. A coronavirus outbreak took place in a city which houses a lab that studies the coronavirus. What are the odds?

Well, consider this. Research labs tend to be in major cities and study viruses found in their region. South China is the region where the original SARS outbreak occurred – caused by a coronavirus.

Wuhan is one of the area's biggest transportation and commercial hubs. Its markets receive goods and agricultural products from all over the country and the world.

If COVID-19 jumped from animals to humans like SARS did, the odds are that an outbreak would be first detected in a place like Wuhan's wildlife markets.

Fourth, there is the suggestion that because the wildlife market was close to the Wuhan Institute of Virology or another virus lab, the virus could have leaked from the lab to the market.

In fact, the earliest cases of the novel coronavirus were found in two separate wildlife markets. Why would the virus leak from a lab to two different wildlife markets?

Wouldn't it be just as likely to go from the lab to two different subway stations, or two different movie theaters?

Finally, there is the claim that three workers at the Wuhan Institute of Virology ""sought hospital care"" in November 2019.

This emerged from an unsourced report in the Wall Street Journal. No proof of this allegation has ever been presented. Even though China made a request, the Journal has not provided the names of the alleged three workers. And all of the researchers and workers at the institute tested negative for the coronavirus.

Favoring the jump from animals to humans – we have scholarly articles in highly respected journals such as Cell, Nature, Science, Nature Medicine, and the Lancet.

We have a report by a team of international scientists appointed by the World Health Organization.

On the other hand, proponents of a lab leak origin have the words of some politicians, the inconclusive findings of a few spy agencies… and no concrete scientific evidence whatsoever. Nothing.

Trump and his former secretary of state Mike Pompeo said there was evidence to back the lab leak. But they never offered any.

So is it difficult to figure out where investigators should search for COVID-19's origins?

President Biden says he can't figure it out – and asked a group of experts to write a report giving him the answer.

A group of expert scientists?

No – a group of expert spies.

Why? The answer is politics. Scientists have already answered this question. And it hasn't satisfied Biden. Spy agencies are more likely to find ways to give the answer the president wants to hear.

Remember the weapons of mass destruction in Iraq?

No matter how many inspections the UN conducted, the U.S. was never satisfied. In the end, weapons of mass destruction were never found, because there were none.

The same will be true of evidence of a lab leak.

From the beginning of the pandemic to this day, the U.S. has lied to the public, and put politics ahead of public health.

No matter how much data researchers collect, conspiracy theorists will always say China is hiding something else.

The lab leak hypothesis cannot be disproven by scientists – because it is political in nature.

It's time for these disinformation games to stop. The pandemic has cost nearly 680,000 American lives, more than the U.S. death toll in the 1918 Spanish flu. Even as the death toll keeps rising, politics continues to get in the way of U.S. solutions.

The U.S. seems not to care that people around the world are dying needlessly.

In the broken U.S. system, politics and personal ambition comes before the health and well-being of the people. Blaming China is easier than learning how to stop a global pandemic.

Some people in the United States hang on to the lab leak hypothesis because it's good for their careers – but COVID-19 should not be a political issue… it's a public health issue.

1283,China's new fact sheet lays bare U.S. interference in HK,"Editor's note: CGTN's First Voice provides instant commentary on breaking stories. The daily column clarifies emerging issues and better defines the news agenda, offering a Chinese perspective on the latest global events.

China's Foreign Ministry released a new fact sheet titled U.S. Interference in Hong Kong Affairs and Support for Anti-China, Destabilizing Forces on Friday. The fact-sheet sets out a comprehensive chronological list of events which details how the United States has sought to interfere in and undermine the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) of China. The report offers graphic insight into every aspect of U.S. support for riots in the city 2019, its backing for leading figures in these events, its attempts to undermine the city through sanctions, embargoes and other measures, as well as its smearing of the region's reputation and attempts to discredit its national security law.

The document is a ""smoking gun"" proof of Washington's meddling.

Sanctions, resolutions and embargoes

In order to encourage unrest and separatism in Hong Kong, the United States actively leveraged an ever-growing number of bills targeting the Hong Kong region. These include the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act of 2019 and the Hong Kong Autonomy Act of 2020. These, in response to the National Security Law, have pushed the imposition of sanctions against local officials, forced banks to comply with these measures with the threat of fines, banned exports to Hong Kong police and cancelled numerous bilateral agreements with the SAR.

All these acts have had one common objective – to hurt and divide China's national sovereignty, to undermine international public opinion of China, and to use as bargaining chips in diplomacy. The acts exaggerate the impact of national security legislation on the city's autonomy accordingly, pretending ""autonomy"" equates to constant unrest and chaos in the region.

Despite the fact that the city continues to have the free economy through its judicial system, the Biden administration unleashed a cynical and bad faith ""Hong Kong business advisory"" in 2021, attempting to claim that the SAR posed risks for American businesses present there."

Editor's note: Azhar Azam works in a private organization as market and business analyst and writes about geopolitical issues and regional conflicts. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily those of CGTN.

History tells America is an incredibly fatal and reliably opportunistic ally that ""has no permanent friends or enemies, only interests."" In May 2018, President of European Council Donald Tusk had to rail against the U.S. ""capricious assertiveness"" on issues including Iran, Gaza, tariffs and North Korea. ""With friends like that (America), who needs enemies?""

The U.S. hits allies harder than its adversaries. Once a major non-NATO ally, Pakistan couldn't wipe the bitter memories of 480 U.S. drone strikes, the only time a country was attacked by its ally, killing more than 70,000 people and incurring economic losses of $150 billion. It's a warning for Australia that says the so-called AUKUS boosts its defense and regional security but in effect is ceding at-least some sovereignty to the U.S. and the UK.

America's lunatic frenemy policy toward its allies has once again pressed France to call out the U.S. and other two alliance states for ""duplicity, contempt and lies"" and stabbing in the back after the defense pact thwarted a $40 billion Canberra-Paris deal, signed in 2016 to build conventional submarines.

In 2015, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker blew the whistle for creation of a European Union (EU) army. However, the British government and politicians rejected his proposal, stating there was ""no prospect"" of such a formation and it would be detrimental to interests of the UK, NATO and the U.S. Still, France and Germany in 2018 cogitated for ""a real, true European army"" as Europeans couldn't trust the U.S. to defend them and times to rely on others had passed.

America's devious withdrawal from Afghanistan is again pushing the EU to ""catalyze"" its own permanent military force after Union's calls, to delay retreat from Kabul airport for safe evacuation of Europeans, fell on deaf ears in Washington. The changing perception is Europe backs the French President Emmanuel Macron's firm position that NATO was ""brain dead"" over waning commitment from its lead guarantor, the U.S.

One of the defining factors behind EU pursuit of autonomous defense has been the relentless criticism from the U.S. over burden-sharing costs. Washington's reproach can be traced back to 1953 when then-U.S. Secretary of State John Foster Dulles shocked his NATO allies by threatening to take up an ""agonizing reappraisal"" if it didn't contribute to the U.S. cold war policy.

Former U.S. President Donald Trump's full-throttled and parochial opposition to America's NATO allies – accusing Germany for being ""captivated to Russia"" and hammering France and other European countries over defense spending or trade deals – is only amongst many reasons for rupturing the transatlantic alliance."
1285,The Quad: A 'united' house that's easily broken,"Editor's note: The video column does what the name says – takes note of ideas that may make people uncomfortable. By taking notes and breaking down various opinions, we try to provide an alternative line of thinking that will hopefully generate deeper discussion.

U.S. President Joe Biden hosting the first in-person Quad meeting pretty much formalizes its ""Asian NATO"" designation.

From the jump, it was viewed as an anti-China move – not my words, but those of the former U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Morton Abramowitz. Former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe described it as forming an ""Arc of Democracy"" in Asia or specifically around China.

The big question now is: Europe had an Iron Curtain, is Asia gonna have an Iron Arc? No.

You see, Europe's division during the Cold War was based on a major factor: The United States and the Soviet Union were the hegemons. Both swooped in and filled the power vacuum in Europe after WWII. NATO operated well because it had one dominant will – the United States – and one single enemy – the Soviet Union.

Asia is different, very different. There's no vacuum here.

Each country is a power in its own right and has its own calculation.

India, for example, may well be in the Quad. But it is also a major political, economic and security partner for China in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and the BRICS. Japan has China as its largest trading partner. Australia, even with its wild anti-China policies, still send about 40 percent of total exports to China. That money is said to be a ""windfall"" to the Australian government as it runs a more than $120 billion budget deficit.

As much as the United States would like to push these countries against China, there is a limit to what they are willing to do. They wouldn't be as easily goaded as previous ones.

And the U.S. itself is conflicted. Biden wants to be tough, to have an alliance of democratic countries to push America's world view. But he also wants to work with China on many issues, including on climate change – a main sticking point of his presidency. He wants to avoid conflict with China – he said it during a phone call with Chinese President Xi Jinping not so long ago.

And this marks the greatest difference. The Quad members, including the United States, don't actually see China as the ""enemy."" I think the better designation for China in this context is ""the country that they want some leverage to deal with.""

The Quad gives them that. By displaying unity, these four countries link themselves politically. So that whenever one of them is engaging with China, that shared identity could be used as leverage to force concessions.

This security and geopolitical alliance is made up by countries with different kinds of relationship with China, to different depths and in different natures. The four countries are not exactly holding hands. They just happen to be walking in a similar direction at this moment in history.

They look like they are in this together. But, each has its own cost-and-benefit equation going on underneath. Just like the U.S. forced its submarines onto Australia, which dumped the French ones in the process, when it's in their naked self-interest, they wouldn't hesitate to choose themselves over their group members.

It's not a house united; it's a house built on sand – and this sand is shifting very quickly.

1286,"Yes, America is back! Look how its agents are treating Haitians","Editor's note: Adriel Kasonta is a London-based political risk consultant and lawyer of Jewish and Tanzanian descent. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views and CGTN.



Love him or hate him, you have to admire Joe Biden's chutzpah.



After winning the presidential election and spectacularly claiming that it is ""time to turn the page"" after four tumultuous years under Donald Trump's predaceous presidency, the Biden administration decided to appeal on Monday against the decision of a federal judge which ruled to block the exercising of Trump-era public health order – allowing the expulsion of migrants without the opportunity to seek asylum.



The order, known as Title 42, came into being in March 2020 and was established by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to justify restrictive measures aimed at keeping the 15,000 cap – the lowest since the 1980 Refugee Act was put in place – on the inflow of migrants, obviously under the pretext of limiting the spread of Covid-19.



The current administration decided to go one step further and has used Title 42 to justify the mass expulsion of Haitian migrants who, in recent days, have set up an encampment in and around Del Rio, a small city in Texas. Since then, the U.S. has been deporting many of them without due process to Port-au-Prince, even as the Haitian government pleads for a ""humanitarian moratorium"" on such removals or sending them fleeing across the Rio Grande into Ciudad Acuna, Mexico.



Haiti is the poorest country in Latin America and the Caribbean, and has experienced numerous natural and political disasters over the last decade or so. In 2010, the country was hit by an earthquake, leaving thousands dead and a million more homeless, and forcing nearly 200,000 Haitians to emigrate to Chile. However, due to racism, anti-immigration sentiment, and the COVID-19 outbreak in the region, many of them decided to further migrate to the U.S. border.



This situation keeps deteriorating. In 2021, thousands of Haitians have fled their home country following the assassination of President Jovenel Moïse on July 7, and the devastating 7.2 magnitude earthquake on August 14. According to the UN, 800,000 Haitians became impacted by the tragedy, with more than 2,000 people dead and 980,000 struggling with ""acute"" food insecurity.



Despite that, the U.S. doesn't individually assess asylum claims and deports the migrants to Haiti. Hence, two UN agencies voiced their ""serious concern"" on Tuesday, based on the initial observation of the situation on the ground.

""We are disturbed by the images we've seen and by the fact that we've seen all these migrants and refugees and asylum seekers being transported to Port-au-Prince,"" Marta Hurtado, the spokeswoman for the UN Human Rights Office, said at a news conference in Geneva.



Meanwhile, Shabia Mantoo, the spokeswoman for the UN Refugee Agency, expressed the concern that some of the people camping out under the bridge in Del Rio ""may have well-founded grounds to request international protection."" She also added her agency has been calling for an end to Title 42 and for the U.S. to ensure access to asylum for people whose lives depend on it."
1287,"President Biden, please practice what you preach","Editor's note: CGTN's First Voice provides instant commentary on breaking stories. The daily column clarifies emerging issues and better defines the news agenda, offering a Chinese perspective on the latest global events. ""We are not seeking a new Cold War or a world divided into rigid blocs,"" U.S. President Joe Biden proclaimed at the United Nations General Assembly. ""All the major powers of the world have a duty, in my view, to carefully manage their relationships so they do not tip from responsible competition into conflict."" Good to hear, very good to hear. Now, it is time for Biden to lead America in a way that lives up to his own words. So far, America's actions have been betraying those words. Ethan Paul at the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft wrote in a response to Biden's speech that the American hegemony has ""inebriated"" Washington to the point that America forgot it has already divided the world into ""rigid"" blocs – America's ""hub-and-spokes"" alliance in Asia being a primary example. And that if China and U.S. had switched places, Paul believes that ""Washington would never accept the degree of strategic vulnerability that it asks of Beijing."" If Chinese alliances and bases have surrounded the U.S., ""absolute pandemonium and mayhem would break out in Washington,"" and the U.S. ""would be set on a permanent war footing.""

All that has taken place seems to be confirming Paul's words. On September 24, mere days after Biden's speech, he will be hosting the leaders of the Quad – U.S., India, Japan and Australia – for the first in-person meeting at the White House, consolidating a decades-long effort in building up an anti-China bloc in the Indo-Pacific region. The U.S. stepped up its nuclear presence in the region by helping the Australians with deploying nuclear submarines. And the central theme of Biden's foreign policy is building an ""alliance of democracies"" – describing global affairs as a contest between ""democratic"" countries and ""authoritarian"" ones. China is seen as a part, if not the leader, of the ""authoritarian"" camp. Deliberately or inadvertently, Biden has defined the world in Cold War terms since he took office. He talked about engaging with China through negotiations, but it had to be from a ""position of strength."" And clearly, that strength means that the American position has to hold – tariffs are still in place, ""genocide"" is still used in every sentence involving Xinjiang, and COVID-19 is still China's fault. Tensions are rising in the South China Sea as the U.S. pushes more military resources into the region, as it cobbles together a group of countries that seek to dominate in those waters. America's intransigence in holding on to this notion of ""strength"" and its overbearing desire to appear to come out on top of everything strangles its ability to see things from China's point of view. ""Carefully managing their relationships,"" as Biden desires, cannot be achieved with one side making demands, threats and ultimatums and, if they are not complied with, disregard the other side's positions as illegitimate and bulldoze them. Neither China nor the United States would be willing to make things work when the guns are pointed at their heads constantly.

1288,Global COVID-19 Summit: An exercise in American selfishness,"Editor's note: Danny Haiphong is an independent journalist and researcher in the United States. He is a contributing editor to the Black Agenda Report, co-editor of Friends of Socialist China, and founding member of the No Cold War international campaign. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

On September 22, U.S. President Joe Biden held a virtual summit on COVID-19 and pledged to increase U.S. assistance in the global fight to end the pandemic. Biden's promises, when taken out of context, appear reasonable. The U.S. will pledge an additional $370 million to administer COVID-19 vaccines globally and work with the European Union to meet the World Health Organization (WHO)'s goal of ensuring 70 percent of the world's population is fully vaccinated by the end of 2022. The U.S. will also increase its donations of ventilators, therapeutics and personal protective equipment (PPE) to lower-income countries.

Unfortunately, the summit was indicative of the selfishness that the United States has demonstrated throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Rather than speak to world leaders as an equal, President Biden positioned the United States as the primary force capable of ending the pandemic. No humility was expressed in the face of the U.S.'s disastrous response to the pandemic up until this point. The United States leads the world in both COVID-19 cases and deaths.

Furthermore, history has proven that promises made by U.S. leaders are rarely kept. The U.S.'s policy on COVID-19 vaccine distribution is a key example. In May, the Biden administration signaled that it would wave vaccine patent restrictions to make Pfizer and Moderna vaccines more accessible to the world. This move was largely symbolic, as it has taken months for the U.S. to increase its donations to the WHO. ""Vaccine apartheid"" has been the result. Poorer, non-white countries have average vaccination rates of less than 10 percent of the population while the U.S. and its Western partners have stockpiled vaccines to the point where millions of doses are nearing their expiration dates.

The summit was thus an attempt by the United States to communicate strength when humility is needed most. Biden stated that the virtual forum was a clear sign that ""democracies can deliver"" on promises to improve the global situation. He firmly asserted, however, that the U.S. was most interested in its own citizens first and the global population second. Such an approach continues the U.S.'s longstanding trend of politicizing COVID-19 at the expense of real cooperation."
1289,"Economic sanctions, medical meltdown hurting Afghans","Editor's note: Hamzah Rifaat Hussain, a former visiting fellow at the Stimson Center in Washington and former assistant researcher at the Islamabad Policy Research Institute, is a TV anchor at Indus News in Pakistan. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

Afghanistan is experiencing a medical meltdown which is unanimously accepted by nations in close proximity to the war-weary country. This necessitates concerted attempts at resuscitating the country's failing health infrastructure given that the United Nations Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordination Martin Griffiths warned that medical supplies and fuel will run out.

For a country battered by sanctions and a toxic 20-year war legacy that led to widespread destitution, the inability to provide medical relief will be nothing short of a tragedy.

Ensuring access to medical supplies will always be a moral imperative. The case of Iran during the initial stages of the COVID-19 pandemic demonstrates the perils of not providing unfettered access to medical aid due to entrenched political differences. The previous U.S. administration's adamancy of keeping sanctions intact resulted in immeasurable harm to the domestic population which lacked medical relief.

On Afghanistan however, such a scenario has catastrophic consequences given its vastly low the Human Development Index (HDI) indicators, war fatigue and political transition. Denial of access to medical supplies with such variables at play will translate into an utter travesty for medical justice with the United Nations, not the United States, eventually releasing funds through the Central Emergency Response Fund as an attempt to boost lifesaving support. The health infrastructure is on the verge of collapse and existing institutions are largely incapacitated.

Ideally, post-war rehabilitation and reconstruction efforts should deal with reviving war-torn populations in conflict zones. It is unfathomable that a country that initiated the Marshall Plan in 1948 in the aftermath of World War II is adamant in keeping sanctions intact for a country that has witnessed almost two decades of conflict."

1291,Democracy is neither a patent nor a white elephant,"Editor's note: The following article is taken from the Chinese-language ""The Real Point."" The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

""Democracy is not a special right reserved to an individual country, but a right for the people of all countries to enjoy."" This was a thought-provoking statement by Chinese President Xi Jinping on September 21 general debate of the 76th session of the United Nations (UN) General Assembly. The following day, in a speech at the Carter Center and the George W. Bush Foundation for U.S.-China Relations, the Chinese ambassador to the United States elaborated on what constitutes democracy with Chinese characteristics.

This is a topic worthy of deeper reflection and exchange in the world. However, people should be careful not to fall into the discourse trap of ""democracy versus dictatorship"" set by some Western politicians, mistaking ""anti-China"" for ""democracy"" and thus pushing the world into a dangerous status of ideological confrontation and intentionally provoked division.

The term democracy originated in ancient Greece, which meant ""rule by the people"" and ""sovereignty belongs to the people."" Throughout more than two thousand years of Western history, this concept has not been truly realized. However, the West, especially the United States, is trying to control the voice of the world's democracy by relying on its strong economic and military power, simplifying democracy to ""one person, one vote"" and ""multi-party system,"" and using this as a template to evaluate the political system of other countries such that a country that is compatible to its standards is considered as democratic, otherwise autocratic.

This practice of rendering Sino-Western relations as ""democracy versus autocracy"" is undemocratic itself. The United States is not qualified to unilaterally define ""democracy,"" let alone imposing its own standards on others or even engaging in the so-called ""democratic revolution.""

Countries have various forms, and each country has the right to choose a democratic system that suits its own national conditions, represents the will of its own people, and hence brings well-being to the people.

In China, people are at the core of democracy. Whether it is in the elections or implementing a multi-party system, it is only to select appropriate people to govern the country. This is a ""whole-process democracy,"" and all major legislation decisions have been made in accordance with the procedures and through democratic brewing in a scientific and democratic manner. Under this type of democracy, China created a type of meritocracy of ""promotion plus election"" characteristics.

On the one hand, at the county and township level in China, there is a direct election, and above the county level, there is an indirect election.

The people can elect their representatives to participate in politics, and the representatives can elect the leaders. On the other hand, Chinese officials must be selected level by level and have rich experience in order to serve the people wholeheartedly. This is why Harvard University Kennedy School has a decade of polls showing that the Chinese people have a supporting percentage of the Communist Party of China at over 90 percent annually."
1292,El Salvador's Bitcoin folly,"Editor's Note : Jeffrey Frankel is professor of capital formation and growth at Harvard University. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

El Salvador this month became the first country to adopt a cryptocurrency – in this case, Bitcoin – as legal tender. I say the first, because others might follow. But they should think twice, because the idea is highly dubious – and likely to be economically dangerous for developing countries in particular.

I will admit that I don't understand the need for cryptocurrencies at all. Like many economists, I fail to see what problem they solve. They aren't well designed to fulfill any of the classic functions of money – a unit of account, store of value, or means of payment – because their prices are so extraordinarily volatile. This volatility is not surprising, because cryptocurrencies are backed neither by reserves nor by the reputation of a well-established institution, such as a government or even a private bank or other trusted corporation.

In fact, Bitcoin and its fellow cryptocurrencies were born from an anarcho-libertarian distrust of central banks. True, many central banks, especially in developing countries, have a history of debasing their currencies. But adopting Bitcoin as legal tender makes little sense for El Salvador.

In 2001, El Salvador adopted the U.S. dollar as legal tender to ensure the monetary stability that the country's national currency, the colón, had historically failed to deliver. The reform worked: the country's annual inflation rate, which had substantially exceeded 10 percent between 1977 and 1995, has declined markedly since the adoption of the dollar. It has been below 2 percent since 2012, and close to zero since 2015 – a rarity in Latin America.

Giving up the monetary independence afforded by issuing one's own currency carries costs – particularly, the loss of the ability to adjust monetary policy in response to local economic conditions. El Salvador already accepted this when it adopted the dollar. The costs would be even greater if a currency as unstable as Bitcoin were the sole national currency. But President Nayib Bukele instead decided to designate both Bitcoin and the dollar as legal tender. The logic behind that decision is surreal.

Bitcoin has not been well received in El Salvador. Domestic residents don't want to be obligated to accept it. International markets also are unenthusiastic. Moody's downgraded El Salvador's debt in July, and S&P could follow suit. The spread between the interest rate that the government must pay on its debt and the U.S. Treasury rate has increased sharply since the plan to Bitcoinize was first announced in June.

There is one function that cryptocurrencies do appear to serve: facilitating illegal transactions. Needless to say, this is not a use that should be encouraged. Even worse in terms of the general welfare, ""mining"" cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin – which relies on so-called blockchain technology to verify transactions – requires staggeringly large amounts of energy and thus harms the environment."

Editor's note: Rabah Arezki, a former chief economist of the World Bank's Middle East and North Africa Region, is Chief Economist and Vice President of Economic Governance and Knowledge Management at the African Development Bank. Jean-Pierre Landau is Associate Professor of Economics at Sciences Po. The article reflects the authors' views, and not necessarily those of CGTN. As the global economy begins to emerge from the COVID-19 crisis, managing inflation risks will be much more challenging in developing countries than in advanced economies. That reflects the nature of the shocks driving inflation and the fact that lower-income countries are ill-equipped to respond to them decisively. A combination of specific shocks and vulnerabilities could thus seriously threaten these countries' economic stability and prosperity.

For starters, developing countries have much greater exposure to environmental shocks, which will become more frequent and severe as a result of climate change. Extreme weather events in effect act as negative supply shocks, causing production to decline and prices to rise – the most difficult conditions for monetary policymakers. Several countries, including Nigeria and Sri Lanka, are currently facing skyrocketing food prices, while Madagascar's drought and ensuing famine is another stark reminder of African developing countries' vulnerability. Developing economies are also more exposed to financial shocks. Sooner or later, monetary policy in advanced economies will normalize and, if past experience is any guide, many emerging markets and poor countries will experience massive capital outflows. The specter of capital flight may be particularly salient for poorer economies, particularly if accompanied by a reduction in development aid. Such sudden stops bring their own policy dilemmas, not least downward pressure on exchange rates. Policymakers can either let their currencies depreciate, which would fuel inflation, or hike interest rates, which would adversely affect growth and debt sustainability. Both types of inflationary shock will be a severe test for monetary policymakers in poorer countries. Many lack the experience and track record needed to ensure their credibility and stabilize inflation expectations. Several negative feedback loops could thus develop. For countries with high levels of foreign-currency-denominated debt, exchange-rate depreciation could lead to a fatal currency mismatch, triggering a debt crisis and a surge in inflation. And the de-anchoring of inflation expectations could have further ramifications for developing economies' already frail financial systems. Moreover, inflation tends to persist long after exchange-rate devaluations. Expenditure-switching policies aimed at replacing increasingly costly imports with cheaper domestically produced goods have often resulted only in mediocre growth and stubbornly high inflation. This has eroded households' purchasing power, fueling poverty and social instability.

Editor's note: Mariam Shah is an Islamabad-based independent researcher in the field of conflict studies and military psychology. The article reflects the author's views, and not necessarily those of CGTN. The strategic impact and the threat to regional peace and stability have already been accelerated since AUKUS was announced. The trilateral pact between the United States, United Kingdom and Australia came as a shock to the world. After abandoning AUS$90 billion ($65 billion) deal with France, Australia partnered with the U.S. and UK to develop nuclear-powered submarines. Australia might be interested in the latest technology, but the strategic gravity of this agreement is more important than the technological aspect.

Few things that are very important to note here include a visible shifting of the alliance, a very calculated move by the U.S. administration to veil the blunders and disgraceful withdrawal from Afghanistan and to redirect its attention to China aggressively. After abandoning Afghanistan, the U.S is flexing its muscles to rise again as a ""power"" that can control land and seas where ever it wants. As the U.S. is no longer concerned about Afghanistan, it shifted its attention and focus to China, and this was anticipated since the withdrawal was announced, but not through this unexpected alliance. The AUKUS union has exposed some of the very important realities now. A shift of the alliances has been witnessed, and the ""U.S-Europe bromance"" seems to be thinning. Now, as the Afghan conundrum came to a close, NATO seems irrelevant to the United States. While things accelerate, things won't be easy for European Union to deal with, as it would never like to be tangled between the U.S. and China in an increasingly tense environment.

1295,CPTPP can't be Taiwan's doors to independence,"Editor's note: CGTN's First Voice provides instant commentary on breaking stories. The daily column clarifies emerging issues and better defines the news agenda, offering a Chinese perspective on the latest global events.

In an interesting twist, Taiwan authorities have applied to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) just days after the Chinese mainland filed its application.

Trade benefits all. Throughout the 1980s, China increased trade ties with the rest of the world as part of its reform and opening-up policy. China joined Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) in 1991 and the World Trade Organization in 2001, two developments that helped integrate the country into the global economy and generate unprecedented global wealth. It helped China's economic growth since the 1980s, leading the country to lift more than 700 million Chinese out of poverty, an unprecedented feat in human history. China has successfully eliminated absolute poverty within its borders.

However, trade has recently been more focused on power games than seeking benefits for the public. It is an open question about whether the application from the DPP officials in Taiwan is intended to help boost the island's economy and help its inhabitants or if the application is a ploy by separatists to take a step toward independence. There is little doubt that nations like the United States and Australia would love to leverage the application to make mischief for China."

The trial on 20 suspects in November 13, 2015, terrorist attacks in the Paris region, which left 130 people dead and 350 injured, has recently opened. This largest trial in French history, involving survivors and family members of 1,800 victims, has sadly awakened those dreadful and agonizing memories of the serial terrorist attacks in 2015-2017, perpetrated by ISIS, targeting major cities in Europe like London, Berlin, Brussels and Barcelona.

The attacks claimed more than 300 innocent lives and injured about 1,700. Europe, once serene and peaceful, was clouded with panic and insecurity, but not just from its own citizens.

From 2015 to 2016, 1.3 million people, a record high since World War II, fled to Europe after their homes and lives were shattered by the wars in Syria and Iraq. That made things harder for economic recovery in Europe after the 10-year financial crisis and heavily burdened the social welfare system. The feeling of stagnation and regression led to the upheaval of Euroscepticism and populism, resulting in political polarization in many countries and a hindered European integration process.

Both symptoms troubling Europe can be attributed to the same root cause: the U.S.'s failure in global anti-terrorism strategy and its crappy Middle East policy. Years of airstrikes scorched the soil of Mesopotamia, disassembled the victim countries' governments, and sowed discord, even hatred, among factions and tribes. Endless war bred extremist ideology and prepared the hotbed of ISIS.

The U.S. opened the Pandora's Box, without regard for the fact that people in the invaded countries were deprived of their basic right to live free from fear and hunger, and stability and prosperity in Europe were compromised.

Has the U.S. ever thought of the negative impact before it launched any overseas military action? It doesn't need to. All the conflict zones since the beginning of last century were off North America shores, which enormously reduced direct damage and social unrest in the U.S. As long as its national interests are protected with collective actions, and possible harm is cut off by the Atlantic Ocean, the U.S. doesn't bother to consider what might happen to its allies.

Putting American interests first is always at the core of the U.S. foreign policy. This doctrine served it right then and serves it right now."
1297,We need to talk about geoengineering,"Editor's note: Gernot Wagner is a clinical associate professor of environmental studies at New York University. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily those of CGTN. There ultimately is no way to stabilize the climate without addressing the fact that humans are emitting far too much carbon dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere, year after year. But cutting emissions is not the only response to the climate crisis, nor was it the one that scientists proposed over half a century ago in the first-ever government report on climate change. To address the problem of ""Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide,"" noted U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson's Science Advisory Committee, the ""solution"" could not be to emit less of the stuff, because that apparently seemed unimaginably costly and difficult to do. Instead, the committee suggested that the effects of excessive CO2 in the atmosphere might be mitigated by brightening the world's oceans to radiate more heat back into space. Since then, many additional methods of ""geoengineering"" have been proposed by both scientists and science-fiction authors alike. Some ideas are more realistic than others, and none can substitute for the top-order priority of severing the link between economic activity and CO2 emissions. Nonetheless, emissions represent only the first of many links in the long causal chain from economic activity to climate crisis. Economic activity produces emissions that drive up atmospheric concentrations, which in turn increases temperatures, thereby creating new conditions that are damaging to human welfare. Whereas cutting CO2 and other greenhouse-gas emissions addresses the first part of the chain, climate adaptation concerns the latter end – from changing temperatures to the impact on society. But the tail end should not necessarily come last in the sequence of our response. If anything, we should have introduced more aggressive adaptation measures a long time ago. This delay owes much to a previous, longstanding fear among environmentalists that the mere mention of adaptation would undermine the primary aim of cutting carbon emissions. According to this argument, adaptation would create a ""moral hazard"": the idea that insulating people from the consequences of their actions will lead them to engage in even riskier behavior. (Think seat belts or condoms.) Most environmentalists have since changed their tune, however. In the mid-1990s, then-U.S. Vice President Al Gore avoided discussing adaptation lest it detract from carbon-cutting efforts. Yet, by the early 2000s, he and most others had begun to include it as a point of emphasis alongside mitigation. And by 2013, adaptation was a key tenet in a climate-policy blueprint issued by President Barack Obama's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology.

But mitigation and adaptation do not exhaust all the options. Carbon removal specifically breaks the second link in the chain, from emissions to concentrations. Technically, emissions could stay the same, while removal sucks enough carbon out of the atmosphere to decrease concentrations, lessening the net effect and giving rise to many a ""net-zero"" climate commitment.



That sounds like a win-win. But it turns out to be a rather expensive proposition, especially when looking beyond trees and other ""nature-based"" solutions. While these remove carbon from the atmosphere, they retain it in the biosphere and are vulnerable to deforestation and natural disasters alike. Other more high-tech methods could put carbon back into the geosphere, storing it permanently underground (from where it came before it was burned as fossil energy).



As with adaptation in earlier decades, the prospect of carbon removal brings moral hazard to the fore, raising many difficult political questions. With so many opportunities for mitigation available, can we really justify subsidies for expensive carbon-removal technologies? Moreover, why should big polluters be let off the hook?



That second question goes to the heart of many political debates around climate and economic policy more broadly. Is climate change caused by too much pollution, or is it a problem of economic growth itself? Those who believe it is the latter argue for a full-scale reining in – or rechanneling – of economic activity and market forces; some even call for ""degrowth"" and other more sweeping societal transformations. Given these associations, it is easy to see why those on the left would be suspicious of carbon removal, and why those on the right might be eager to embrace it.



The political dynamics driving the carbon-removal debate are even stronger in discussions of solar geoengineering. By reflecting more of the sun's radiation, this potential intervention aims to break the link between atmospheric CO2 and rising temperatures. It would not address ocean acidification and other problems directly tied to higher atmospheric concentrations, but it could have its own advantages. Chief among these is that the effects could be virtually immediate, reducing temperatures within months and years, rather than decades and centuries.



Serious discussions of solar geoengineering have long since moved on from the Johnson White House's ideas about brightening the world's oceans. The most-discussed method today envisions the seeding of small reflective particles into the lower stratosphere to mimic the global cooling effects of large volcanic eruptions. (This is precisely what the Indian government does in sci-fi author Kim Stanley Robinson's new novel, ""The Ministry for the Future"", following a heat wave that kills tens of millions of people.)



Some describe this scale of geoengineering as a ""last-ditch"" option that should be reserved only for a planetary emergency. Others emphasize that it should be viewed only as a potential complement to serious emissions reductions and other interventions – from adaptation to carbon removal – with each addressing climate risks differently.



But, again, those who merely argue for more research into solar geoengineering usually meet with strident ""moral-hazard"" objections, as if simply studying the issue will distract from emissions cuts. We must move beyond that argument. Remember, adaptation measures used to be viewed the same way.



Regardless of whether one believes that solar geoengineering is inherently dangerous, potentially useful, or both, one should support more careful, open and transparent research into the matter. We are not in a position where we can peremptorily reject potential solutions to the climate crisis. If nothing else, geoengineering research could help to educate those who are still dragging their feet on emissions reductions.



After all, by failing to break the other links in the climate chain, we are making it more likely that either carbon removal or solar geoengineering will become a key element in the 21st century climate-policy portfolio – whether one likes it or not.

1298,Democrats' internal spending feud has serious implications for future,"Editor's note: Bradley Blankenship is a Prague-based American journalist, political analyst and freelance reporter. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily those of CGTN. U.S. President Joe Biden's Democratic Party has been locked in an internal feud for weeks over the next big spending package. So-called moderates within the party are eager to see through a bipartisan, $1 trillion infrastructure bill that passed the Senate in August; meanwhile the progressive wing of the party is focused on the broader agenda that concentrates on a greener economy and expanded social welfare. For the latter group, this means passing a $3.5 trillion reconciliation bill that is essentially resistant to a Senate filibuster, meaning the evenly split Senate can pass it without any support from Republicans. But the problem for them is that they believe their ""moderate"" colleagues will tank this package, billed as ambitious with a huge price-tag to boot, after passing the infrastructure bill. That is, progressives believe that moderate Democrats like Senator Joe Manchin will buck the party line on the reconciliation bill after securing a ""huge"" win on infrastructure. And so, because of this, they have threatened to vote against the infrastructure bill unless the broader Biden agenda is also part of the equation. For their part, moderates have signaled that they would rather see the infrastructure bill die than be pressured into raising taxes and seemingly out of control spending by their Democratic colleagues, according to a report by Politico. This would essentially mean the death of President Biden's entire domestic political program. That's because this reconciliation bill is, thanks to the needlessly complex rules of the Senate, probably set to be the last major piece of legislation to come out of the Biden presidency's first two years. At the same time, Biden and many Democrats desperately need this legislative win – something they campaigned heavily on to win during the 2022 midterm elections.

Consider these facts: Biden is sitting at an average disapproval of 49 percent (higher than his 46.3 percent approval) and justified criticism abounds, thanks to the administration's botched Afghanistan withdrawal and handling of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Not to mention, Republicans are launching an all-out assault on voting rights in some states.



This is in addition to the fact that all relevant historical trends seem to suggest that the president's party will probably lose power in Congress in the upcoming midterm elections, according to an analysis by FiveThirtyEight.



This likely outcome means that the Biden administration would be a lame duck for two additional years, yielding no positive results on its domestic agenda whatsoever for that time which would almost certainly result in a victory for Republicans in the 2024 presidential elections, ushering in, once again, Donald Trump or someone even more dangerous.



All of this is potentially set into motion by a band of so-called moderates who are scoffing at a spending bill that is not that radical or ambitious.



As was described in New York Magazine by Eric Levitz, while the media has accurately described its price tag as $3.5 trillion, it has failed to contextualize this spending with the fact that it's spread out over 10 years. It means that this spending bill would be dwarfed by the massive stimulus bills that were each supported by these so-called moderates.



Sure, the reconciliation bill is offset by increasing taxes. But it must be noted first that the bill would cut taxes for roughly 90 percent of American households that earn less than $200,000 a year, according to congressional estimates. As for the upper income tax rates, this would only be brought back to where it was under the last Democratic president, Barack Obama.



At the same time, the corporate tax rate would rise from 21 percent to 26.5 percent, which is a small hike considering the top corporate tax rate was about 39 percent when Obama left office. There's no doubt that the ultra-wealthy would be taxed significantly higher, but America's inequality is already so out of control that even this slight countermeasure is extraordinarily moderate.



As for how the bill might spur a runaway spiral into ""socialism,"" every social benefit in this package – things like child allowance, paid family leave – would still be well below the OECD average.



It speaks volumes to how broken the country's political system is when the Biden agenda could come crashing down after less than a year in office – and over a bill that is objectively a compromise sitting at, for posterity, roughly $350 billion annually.

1299,Behind the numbers discussed at the Global COVID-19 Summit,"Editor's note: Anthony Moretti is an associate professor at the Department of Communication and Organizational Leadership of Robert Morris University. The article reflects the author's views and not necessarily those of CGTN.

When world leaders come together, they sometimes just cannot help themselves. They need to make big, broad and boastful promises in order to ensure the attention they are receiving is validated.

Wednesday was one of those days in Washington. U.S. President Joe Biden announced at a global gathering on coronavirus that the United States will purchase 1 billion doses of the Pfizer vaccine with the guarantee that every dose will be used to vaccinate people in many of the world's poorest countries.

This is the kind of leadership America should be providing, and Biden's promise is another reminder of the shameful way in which his predecessor either blamed a certain country for causing the coronavirus pandemic or simply ignored the crisis as it worsened. Nevertheless, we need to be cautious before we stand too quickly and applaud too loudly in recognizing what has been pledged by the United States.

In reviewing the president's guarantee, the Associated Press reported the following: ""The U.S. purchase of another 500 million shots brings the total U.S. vaccination commitment to more than 1.1 billion doses through 2022. About 160 million shots supplied by the U.S. have already been distributed to more than 100 countries … The remaining American doses will be distributed over the coming year.""

Nowhere in the AP story was an acknowledgment that China plans to donate 2 billion vaccines doses – or double the amount offered by Biden – before the end of this calendar year – or in three months instead of 15.

You read that correctly: Double the doses in roughly one-fifth of the time. And just in case you were thinking that information about China was not relevant to what the president was planning, please remember that plenty of stories in the Western media reviewed how the European Union was lagging behind the United States in exporting vaccines across the globe. Put more bluntly: The president's pledge looked better when compared to Western Europe, but it would have looked paltry if China's commitment had been brought into the media discourse.

The New York Times provided a bit more realism in its reporting, stating: ""Mr. Biden has been under intense pressure from global health experts to do more to address the vaccine shortage – and in particular expand manufacturing around the world. Biden said the U.S. is doing so, through a partnership with India, Japan and Australia."""
1300,COVID-19 origins study is not a sensational TV show,"The program does not explore critically how the ""theory"" of the lab leak emerged and forced its way into the mainstream. It did not come from a scientific background, but as an instrument of far-right Republicans, such as Senator Tom Cotton, who used it to push his aggressive agenda on China. It utilizes a guilt by association argument and rests on a number of assumptions and speculations. This is why it was never taken seriously, and the only scientists who have contemplated it are ones whose careers have a stake in politics.

For a so-called impartial analysis, CNN fails to offer any balanced perspective or critical insight as to how the origins of the virus have become an instrument of politics, as opposed to a credible scientific question up for investigation and study. It presents the lab-leak search as something neutral and scientific, when it has been in fact aggressively weaponized by U.S. politicians for geopolitical gain. On top of that, it then fails to mention how this politicization itself has stifled scientific investigation for its genuine origins and undermined international cooperation. The search for the origins of this virus is not a sensational TV show, yet this is how CNN markets it to be.

Earlier this week, CNN ran a documentary titled ""The Origins of COVID-19: Searching for the Source,"" featuring again the tired trope of speculation regarding the ""lab-leak theory"" of the virus origins and interviews with a number of virologists and scientists speculating on the origins of the pandemic. The program offered no clear answers but proceeded to pour cold water over the World Health Organization's (WHO) first study in Wuhan, cynically playing down its conclusions as being politically motivated as if to give the impression that the laboratory leak was not given enough consideration.

Dr. Robert Redfield, former U.S. CDC director, was quoted in the program saying, ""I do not believe this somehow came from a bat to human and at that moment in time, the virus came to the human, became one of the most infectious viruses that we know in humanity."" While it is absurd for him to use the timing of the virus's emergence as the basis for the lab-leak theory report and ignoring that many infectious diseases in human history has zoonotic origins and became widespread out of the blue, it is astonishing that a U.S. CDC director would make such unscientific speculations at a time when his country was registering COVID-19 cases in the hundreds of thousands with thousands of deaths each day.

But, perhaps it shouldn't be such a surprise coming from an official who overruled CDC scientists and softened recommendations to suggestions at the White House's behalf.

Later, the WHO's COVID-19 origins study did not suit the narrative of ""blame"" on China, and the White House sought to undermine it willingly and trash its credibility. There is no reason to question the data or findings of that report, the problem is its conclusions were benign and not incriminating enough. The United States has leveraged funding and accused the WHO of being ""too pro-China"" to deliberately undermine the credibility of WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, leading him to do a U-turn on the lab-leak theory and speculate on the idea because it was in the interests of his political survival to do so. Essentially, American politicization has undermined the WHO as a medium of world health governance.

CNN has asked a number of questions as to how a natural origin came about, but did the authors and editors not contemplate the fact that the very politicization of the virus which they are staking this piece on is itself a barrier to this investigation? Has it not contemplated that so many people have pushed this theory out of bad faith and opportunism, that China might no longer see the value in cooperation? As Biden's own intelligence review concludes, Beijing is experiencing ""frustration"" that the issue is being ""used to exert political pressure on China."" It is no wonder when pieces like this continue to make baseless insinuations again and again and turn the pandemic into a political football rather than a scientific query.

This is why we are where we are today.

1301,Xi's speech unveils China's plan for the future of the world,"Editor's note: Liu Chunsheng is an associate professor at the Beijing-based Central University of Finance and Economics. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily those of CGTN.

On September 21, Chinese President Xi Jinping attended the General Debate of the 76th Session of the United Nation General Assembly via video link and delivered an important speech titled ""Bolstering Confidence and Jointly Overcoming Difficulties to Build a Better World.""

Xi's speech is of great significance at the moment when human beings are once again at the crossroads of history. The world has been braving COVID-19 since the beginning of 2020. People's lives, health and economic and social development have undergone major challenges due to the disease. According to data from the World Health Organization, the world had registered over 228 million confirmed COVID-19 cases and over 4.6 million related deaths as of September 21.

The pandemic has plunged the global economy into a serious recession, particularly impacting developing countries. The impact of the pandemic and economic stagnation may take several years to fade. International trade and investment have slipped into decline, while global production networks and supply chains have been experiencing turbulence. As for the least-developed countries, the pandemic has manifested as a humanitarian crisis.

In these times, protectionism, unilateralism and political bullying have increased in some economies, and globalization has been facing retrogression. At the same time, a series of deeper structural contradictions plague the world economy. Traditional economies are facing many difficulties in transforming and upgrading. The growth of emerging industries is slow, science and technology need new breakthroughs, and the new growth drivers have not yet fully replaced the old ones."
1302,Takeaways from Xi's and Biden's speeches at the UN,"Xi said it is not uncommon to see countries having differences and disagreements. The way to resolve them is through dialogue and cooperation based on equality and mutual respect. One country's success doesn't imply the failure of another. The world is large enough to accommodate the joint growth and progress of multiple countries. He then went on to say China never bullied or invaded other countries in the past and will not do that in the future. China has no intention to seek world hegemony.

Towards the end of President Xi's speech, he said the world should accommodate different forms of civilization and multiple paths to modernization. Democracy is not a special right reserved to an individual country, and democracy-building via military means leads to disaster, as evidenced by recent events.

It would be an interesting exercise to look at the relevant parts of their speeches for comparison purposes.

On September 21, Chinese President Xi Jinping and U.S. President Joe Biden each delivered a speech within a few hours apart at the general debate of the 76th session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA). Biden's speech was a bit longer, covering a range of issues, while Xi's speech focused on China's position with respect to the more near-term issues of combating the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent economic recovery.

Editor's note: John Gong is a professor at the University of International Business and Economics and a research fellow at the Academy of China Open Economy Studies at UIBE. The article reflects the author's views and not necessarily those of CGTN.

The keywords of the Chinese President's obviously are dialogue and cooperation. Now, let's look at what Biden has to say about its relations with China. The following paragraph is most relevant in my view:

""All the major powers of the world have a duty, in my view, to carefully manage their relationships; so they do not tip from responsible competition to conflict. The United States will compete and will compete vigorously and lead with our values and our strength … But we're not seeking - I'll say it again - we are not seeking a new cold war or a world divided into rigid blocs. The United States is ready to work with any nation that steps up and pursues peaceful resolution to shared challenges, even if we have intense disagreements in other areas ...""

The words ""compete"" and ""competition"" appeared three times in this short paragraph. So here comes the major difference between the two countries in terms of their respective perceptions and positions regarding the bilateral relationship between them.

While China hopes for a cooperative relationship while seeking to resolve differences and disagreements via dialogue, the United States sees it mostly as a competitive relationship, which naturally entails the existence of two adversary sides or rivals, although there are still areas of cooperation, such as COVID-19, climate control and nuclear nonproliferation - as Biden alluded to in the speech.

However, there are also points that are worth noticing in Biden's messages. First, he introduced the concept of ""responsible competition"" as the opposite end of ""conflict."" It's hoped that ""conflict"" could also cover ""confrontation"" - a concept that Secretary of State Antony Blinken has referred to in several previous Sino-U.S. relations statements known as the ""3C"" strategy: compete, collaborate and confront.

Second, as Biden emphasized twice - that the United States explicitly committed to not seeking a cold war or a world divided into rigid blocs. The exact meaning of that certainly still waits to see future actions from Washington. But in any case, does that mean Washington is not going to develop cold-war-like alliances targeting a particular country?

NATO is a Cold War legacy that probably can be argued as not pertaining to this debate. But actions like establishing the Quad (consisting of the U.S., the UK, Japan and India) and the more recently announced AUKUS (the U.S., the UK and Australia) in the Indo-Pacific region certainly raise doubts about Washington's sincerity regarding that ""no cold war"" statement, even though both Quad and AUKUS are still not purely security and defense alliances.

1303,Taming the stagflationary winds,"Editor's note: Mohamed A. El-Erian is the President of Queens' College, University of Cambridge, and a former chairman of U.S. President Barack Obama's Global Development Council. He is the author of ""The Only Game in Town: Central Banks, Instability, and Avoiding the Next Collapse"". The article reflects the author's opinions, and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

A stream of recent data suggests that the global economy is showing signs of stagflation, that odd 1970s-style mixture of rising inflation and declining growth. Those who have noticed it – and there are still too few of them – fall into two broad camps. Some see the phenomenon as temporary, and quickly reversible. Others fear that it will lead to a renewed period of unsatisfactory growth, but this time with unsettlingly high inflation.

But a third scenario, which draws on both of these views, may well be the most plausible. Stagflationary winds are more likely to be a part of the global economy's upcoming journey than a feature of its destination. But how policymakers navigate this journey will have major implications for longer-term economic well-being, social cohesion, and financial stability.

The much-needed global economic recovery has recently been losing steam as growth in its two major locomotives has undershot consensus expectations. The more contagious Delta variant of the coronavirus has dampened spending in some sectors, such as leisure and transportation, while hampering production and shipments in others, particularly manufacturing. Labor shortages are becoming more widespread in a growing number of advanced economies. Add to that a shipping-container shortage and the ongoing reordering of supply chains, and it should come as no surprise that the headwinds to a strong and sustainable global recovery are being accompanied by higher and more persistent inflation.

Higher inflation is putting pressure on those central banks that wish to maintain an exceptionally loose monetary policy. At the same time, decelerating economic growth presents a problem for central banks that are more inclined to scale back stimulus measures. All this also risks eroding political support for much-needed fiscal and structural policies to boost productivity and long-term growth potential.

Some economists, and the majority of policymakers, believe that current stagflationary trends will soon be muted by a combination of market forces and changes in human behavior. They point to recent declines in previously spiking lumber prices as indicative of how competition and increased supply will dampen inflation. They think the sharp fall in Delta-variant cases in the United Kingdom foreshadows what lies ahead for the U.S. and other countries still in the grips of the latest COVID-19 wave. And they take comfort from multiplying signs of booming corporate investment in response to supply disruptions.

Others are more pessimistic. They argue that demand headwinds will intensify due to reductions in fiscal schemes that were supporting household income, citing the expiration of supplementary unemployment benefits and direct cash transfers. They also worry about the gradual exhaustion of the cash buffers that many households unexpectedly accumulated as a result of exceptionally generous government support during the pandemic.

On the supply side, the stagflation pessimists welcome higher business investment but fear that its benefits won't come fast enough, especially as supply chains are redirected. Supply disruptions will therefore persist for much longer, in their view, and central banks will fall behind with the needed policy response.

I suspect that neither of these scenarios is likely to dominate the period ahead. But they will influence the alternative that does materialize.

Ideally, policymakers would respond in a timely and self-reinforcing manner to the increasing evidence of stagflation. The U.S. would lead by progressing faster on a policy pivot, with the Federal Reserve already unwinding some of its ultra-loose monetary policy and Congress enabling President Joe Biden's administration to advance its plans to enhance U.S. productivity and longer-term growth by boosting investments in physical and human infrastructure. Meanwhile, national and international financial authorities would coordinate better to strengthen prudential regulation, especially as it pertains to excessive risk-taking among non-bank market participants."
1304,The Global North's great test,"Editor's note: Gordon Brown is a former prime minister of the United Kingdom, and United Nations Special Envoy for Global Education and Chair of the International Commission on Financing Global Education Opportunity. The article reflects the author's opinions, and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

With low-income countries in Africa and elsewhere still imploring rich countries to stop stockpiling millions of unused COVID-19 vaccines, there are still real doubts as to whether the United States and Europe will honor the promise made at this year's G7 summit to vaccinate the world by the end of 2022.

U.S. President Joe Biden's administration has said that the Global North can deliver enough doses for everyone by next September's United Nations General Assembly. But the gulf between the vaccine-rich and vaccine-poor has grown so vast that under two percent of adults in low-income countries are fully vaccinated, compared to over 50 percent of adults in most high-income countries. Worse, millions of doses in high-income countries are now being wasted because they are not being used in time.

For many months earlier this year, Western governments could at least say that there was not enough vaccine supply to meet global demand. But, we are now producing 1.5 billion vaccines every month. As I write this, around 300 million doses of vaccines are lying unused, hoarded in warehouses or on their way to fulfill delivery contracts that have been monopolized by Western countries. As a result, the World Health Organization's September 2021 goal of vaccinating at least 10 percent of the population in every low-income country – the basic level needed to cover health workers and the elderly – remains unrealized.

According to a major study by the research firm Airfinity, the number of unused doses will reach one billion by this December. To put that staggering figure into perspective, it is enough to meet our year-end goal of vaccinating 40 percent of the African population.

Making matters worse, Airfinity shows that if we do not act, 100 million unused vaccine doses will have passed their expiration dates by the end of this year. And if we cannot airlift surpluses to where they are needed on a schedule that preserves a two-month shelf life, this figure could rise to 241 million. Either way, that is near-criminal wastage.

Exaggeration comes easily to politicians. But it is no overstatement to say that unless more vaccines, diagnostics, and treatments are made available to the Global South, there could be at least one million more COVID-induced deaths over the next year.

We know that more than 100,000 lives have been saved in Britain, owing to the administration of fewer than 100 million vaccine doses. Allowing 200 million or more doses to be wasted is thus tantamount to condemning hundreds of thousands of unvaccinated people in low-income countries to unnecessary suffering or death."
1305,Does China want to make Beijing the epicenter of sustainable finance?,"Editor's note: Matteo Giovannini is a finance professional at the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China in Beijing and a member of the China Task Force at the Italian Ministry of Economic Development. The article reflects the author's views, and not necessarily those of CGTN.

For decades, the global financial industry has been driven by an approach based on short-term performance with an excessive focus on meeting profit targets in each quarter while forgetting the role of strategy and long-term value creation.

The so-called ""short-termism,"" guided by the goal of wealth maximization for the shareholder, has sadly demonstrated to be nearsighted and represent a major factor in undermining sustainable business models and deteriorating the trust built with customers, employees, and investors.

A shift in paradigm from shareholder value to stakeholder-focused model has seen China emerge in a leading position on a global scale due to its high level of responsiveness to environmental issues, demonstrating that the country is well-aware of the growing role that the green economy is going to play as a new engine of growth and development.

Therefore, it is not surprising to learn that the country, through a letter sent last week by Finance Minister Liu Kun to the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) Foundation, has formally made public its candidature to host in Beijing the headquarters of a new international corporate sustainability agency.

The new body, which is set to supervise corporate rules on climate change and environmental reporting endorsed by G20 finance ministers and central bankers during a recent meeting in Italy, is expected to announce its hosting place before the UN climate summit in Scotland in November.

In my view, China's decision to support its capital city in getting assigned the new agency clearly shows the level of confidence that the country has reached after the progressive implementation of an array of green technologies, including hydro, wind, and solar power, that have contributed to turning megacities such as Beijing into a greener, cleaner, and more inclusive place to live.

A recent report from the American consultancy firm Boston Consulting Group (BCG) on the world's best places to live certifies this trend showing that now Beijing leads in Asia and precedes most of the globally celebrated urban centers such as Zurich, Sydney, Singapore, and San Francisco.

From a diplomatic perspective, the move represents a strong signal of continuity with China's decision to join the Paris Agreement in 2016 and with the pledge, made by Chinese President Xi Jinping at the 75th session of the UN General Assembly, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to develop a green and sustainable economy during the next four decades.

The decision to become a global protagonist in the future of the green economy demonstrates that the country is more than willing to engage with the rest of the world and, when necessary, to pioneer in fields where it has a competitive advantage and an unrivaled expertise.

Technological innovation has always represented a key pillar in China's development story, and the current green transformation makes this aspect even more critical due to the fact that technology enables more efficient use of resources, promotes productivity improvements, and provides the solution to historical problems such as the high level of carbon emissions and pollution."

Editor's note: Danny Haiphong is a journalist based in the United States and activist with the No Cold War international campaign. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN. The formation of AUKUS signals another attempt by the United States to mobilize its so-called allies to police the Pacific. Though neither the U.S., UK, nor Australia were willing to name China as the target of the alliance, it isn't the first time that the U.S. has disguised its hostile policy toward China in the rhetoric of multilateralism. The Quadrilateral Security Dialogue or ""Quad"" represented the first such attempt, but a lack of strategic coherency within this alliance has led the U.S. to shift its focus back to ""traditional"" allies in the West.

The U.S., UK, and Australia share a common history as nations relied upon colonialism and aggression as anchors for development. AUKUS allegedly creates a comprehensive technological and economic strategy but so far has only one concrete proposal: the development of a nuclear-powered submarine fleet for Australia. This fleet is said to be an important factor in the broader goal of making the Pacific ""safer."" Military and political analysts in the West have been more than willing to name China as the principal ""threat"" to the safety of the Pacific. U.S. commentators and columnists such as Thomas Friedman of the New York Times and Jake Tapper of CNN, for example, have repeated the evidence-free claims that China threatens the U.S. access to trade routes in the Pacific. However, CNN military analyst and former U.S. Colonel Cedric Leighton admitted on U.S. national television that China has not yet done anything to interfere with these coveted trade routes. AUKUS is thus based on a fabrication that reveals that the so-called pact is nothing more than an expression of the U.S.'s military strategy to police the Pacific. This strategy has already caused more harm than good. Divisions are sharpening among Western countries, with New Zealand rejecting the pact and France pulling its ambassadors from the U.S. and Australia. AUKUS has also brought opposition to uranium mining in Australia, inflaming domestic political tensions in that country. It is the U.S., however, that shares the bulk of responsibility for escalating tensions with China in a moment when its own domestic political situation is far from stable. More than 12 thousand Haitian refugees have migrated to Texas, where they face brutal treatment and deportation from federal authorities.

1307,Tired repetition of 'lab leak' theories is like flogging a dead horse,"Screenshot of the documentary ""What Really Happened in Wuhan"" on the website of Sky News Australia.

Screenshot of the documentary ""What Really Happened in Wuhan"" on the website of Sky News Australia.

Editor's note: CGTN's First Voice provides instant commentary on breaking stories. The daily column clarifies emerging issues and better defines the news agenda, offering a Chinese perspective on the latest global events.

Several weeks ago, the long-awaited 90-day ""Intelligence Review"" into the origins of the COVID-19 as commissioned by the Biden administration came to a completion. But, to nobody's surprise, the report was met with a whimper from the mainstream media because it failed to satisfy the narrative that the virus had ""leaked from a laboratory,"" as there was no serious evidence available to satisfy what has been at best a science-fiction conspiracy theory.

Case closed, right?

Not quite. Despite this, many outlets in the mainstream media have continued to project the false narrative based on sheer speculation that the origins of COVID-19 stem from an accident in the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV). One of these, pushed by Murdoch-owned Sky News Australia, included a documentary titled ""What Really Happened in Wuhan"" by Sharri Markson – again an attempt to make a ""smoking gun"" with deeply flawed evidence that the laboratory leak is real.

The problems with this video are abundant. First, it attempts to cite evidence of a cover-up from the WIV stemming from September 2019. However, four U.S. intelligence agencies in Biden's own review contradict this claim by acknowledging that Chinese officials had ""no foreknowledge"" of the emerging COVID-19 pandemic.

The video proceeds to claim that Huang Yanling, who was claimed to be a researcher at the WIV, is the so-called patient zero based on earlier claims that workers at the institute were reportedly sick around November 2019. It then makes the false claim she is ""missing"" and has never been heard of since.

An article from Health Analytics Asia debunks this misleading information, noting that she was a former student working at the institute completing her master's degree in 2015. She now lives elsewhere and never contracted the virus. This is why her information ""disappeared"" from the website."
1308,AUKUS gaining universal acceptance in Indo-Pacific simply delusional,"Take Malaysia and Indonesia for example. It took only days for the two Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) member states to jointly express concern over this pact being a potential trigger for an evolving arms race in the region, which might upset the smooth flow of trade and compromise economic prosperity, the bedrock of ASEAN stability. Note that both Jakarta and Kuala Lumpur acknowledge that this security pact is laced with anti-pacifism and is quintessentially a boisterous display of Western power countering a rising China. Strong bilateral relations with the United States or Australia do not preclude the fact that each state will not extend blanket acceptance of such security pacts as each country strives for a demilitarized and denuclearized zone. The presence of nuclear submarines goes against this principle and is simply unacceptable.

If the objective of the AUKUS security pact between the United Kingdom, Australia and the United States is to bifurcate the globe into ""pro-China"" and ""anti-China"" camps, then that strategy is doomed to fail. In a testament to the looming failure of this dangerous alliance, Southeast Asian states with foreign policy priorities of ""non-alignment"" have issued calls for de-escalation and denuclearization, which have been echoed since the pact came into force. Despite the dissemination of nuclear technologies, sharing of sensitive information and defense force partnerships, military engagements have encountered suspicion in the region. If the Morrison, Biden and Johnson administrations believe that the foreign policies of other countries would be fine-tuned to the whims and wishes of AUKUS, the Southeast Asia case demonstrates that they are mistaken.

Editor's note: Hamzah Rifaat Hussain, a former visiting fellow at the Stimson Center in Washington and former assistant researcher at the Islamabad Policy Research Institute, is a TV anchor at Indus News in Pakistan. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

There is also a growing understanding that events across the world, such as the aftermath of the 20-year U.S. war in Afghanistan, are products of flawed doctrines of intervention co-sponsored by Washington's allies. That is precisely why Biden administration officials such as Vice President Kamala Harris and her anti-China tirades during her South East Asia tour earlier were not reciprocated by any ASEAN member state. Note further that the additional nuclear dimension in the region will only reinforce the narrative that imperialist designs and great power rivalry are being pursued, which imperils the neighborhood due to further military buildups and the risk of miscalculations running high. This also explains why even one of the strongest allies of Australia, Singapore, has expressed concern over Canberra's entire plan of acquiring a nuclear-powered fleet. Can Singapore, or any other state for that matter, be blamed for denouncing the pact as disturbing? The answer is no.

Nuclear-powered submarines cannot be acquired without the future development of nuclear weapons programs, which have proven to be controversial internationally and historically. It also goes against the Non-Proliferation Treaty and the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, the latter of which became effective in early 2021 without Australia joining as a signatory. The central tenets of the treaty mandate that all member states will refrain from testing, acquiring, possessing or stockpiling nuclear weapons, yet the Morrison administration has stated that the treaty would go against Australia's security objectives and its alliance with the United States, a nuclear weapons state. Hence, concerns regarding brazen proliferation and a probable deterioration in the deterrence equation in the region are well-founded, logical and principled.

Assurances from AUKUS states regarding the security pact being free of anti-China sentiments will not be bought, given the respective foreign policy priorities of each member state in the Indo-Pacific. In 1995, ASEAN signed the Treaty of Southeast Asia Nuclear Weapon Free Zone, which aims to keep the region denuclearized. However, no nuclear weapons state has signed the treaty. Also, an understanding exists that powers such as the United States are more interested in military buildups and policies of encirclement and attrition than the treaty, which the regional states have historically banked upon.

To believe that AUKUS would gain universal acceptance in the Indo-Pacific would be simply delusional. From the outset, it is a nonstarter.

Editor's note: CGTN's First Voice provides instant commentary on breaking stories. The daily column clarifies emerging issues and better defines the news agenda, offering a Chinese perspective on the latest global events.

The world is at a historical crossroads, facing unprecedented dangers from climate change, a global pandemic, and uneven development that leaves many without basic living necessities.

In the face of these threats, humanity has the choice of working together for the common good of all, or choosing to exploit this period of turbulence and transformation for selfish and narrow gains.

The three most crucial threats facing mankind at this moment are climate change, the pandemic, and a movement toward division and war over multilateralism and cooperation.

Some people are under the mistaken impression that protecting the environment must come at the cost of economic growth, but this is not true. Protecting the environment and pursuing development are not at odds, but can work together to bring a better life for everybody.

In recent years, China has demonstrated this again and again with domestic development projects that drive local growth by protecting local natural resources.

China is now demonstrating to the world how this principle can work.

In his speech to the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA), President Xi Jinping committed to stopping financial support to any new coal-fired power plants abroad, and redirecting China's support to green and low-carbon energy.

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres praised Xi's pledge, saying that accelerating the global phase out of coal is the single most important step to keep the 1.5-degree goal of the Paris Agreement within reach.

The development of green technology, an area in which China is a global leader, is key to reaching climate change goals, and also keeping a balance between man and nature.

Another threat facing humanity at this crossroads is the COVID-19 pandemic. People's lives must be given priority in the battle against the coronavirus.

Shockingly, some countries have still not learned this lesson.

Some countries, in a rush to put their economy first by sidetracking science, have ended up hurting their economies and people more if they had just implemented simple public health measures in the first place.

World leaders need to respect science, take a science-based approach, and follow the laws of science when fighting COVID-19. Nations must work together to enhance a coordinated global COVID-19 response and minimize the risk of cross-border virus transmission.

Vaccination is the most powerful weapon against COVID-19. President Xi has stressed on many occasions the need to make vaccines a global public good and ensure vaccine accessibility and affordability in developing countries. China is doing its part by aiming to provide 2 billion vaccine doses to the world by the end of this year. China is also donating $100 million to COVAX, and donating 100 million vaccine doses to other developing countries in the course of this year.

But as China tries to help fight COVID-19, others are taking advantage of this plague upon humanity to isolate and alienate their political rivals. China will continue to support and engage in global science-based virus origins tracing, and stands firmly opposed to scapegoating and silly political games that cost people's lives."
1310,The UN must strive to achieve equitable international order,"Editor's note: Alfred de Zayas is professor of international law, former secretary of the UN Human Rights Committee and UN's independent expert on the promotion of a democratic and equitable international order from 2012 to 2018. Adriel Kasonta is a London-based political risk consultant and lawyer of Jewish and Tanzanian descent. The article reflects the authors' opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

It's said that ""history repeats itself, first as tragedy, second as farce,"" but we are far from suggesting that we are facing the latter.

As UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres stated before the 76th session of the UN General Assembly, which began on September 21, the focus of this summit is the U.S.' ""cold war"" with China.

""We need to avoid at all cost a cold war that would be different from the past one, and probably more dangerous and more difficult to manage,"" Guterres told The Associated Press in an interview.

Interestingly, the same dilemma occupied the thoughts of the participants to ""the first intercontinental conference of colored peoples in the history of mankind,"" as former President of Indonesia Sukarno called the Bandung Conference, which took place on April 18-24, 1955.

The conference in Indonesia was a response from African and Asian countries to the San Francisco Conference in 1945, which excluded many of the newly independent colonial countries from participation, and by default playing any significant role in the management of international affairs. In this sense, Bandung was more representative of the Third World than the conference in the U.S., which gave birth to the UN Charter and was dominated by the West.

At that time, similarly to what we are experiencing today, tensions between two geopolitical ""colossuses"" – the U.S. and Soviet Russia – were the origin of the international instability.

Fear of nuclear war and return to the pre-independence state of affairs resulted in an incredible determination to achieve peace and cooperation among the Global Southern nations, which ultimately decided that the UN would be the best possible place to raise their voice.

These countries brought the truly ""universal"" nature of international law into Geneva, as it was at Bandung when the interplay between the discipline and imperialism was formally challenged. But most importantly, the conference questioned the Eurocentric interpretation of the global order.

When global imperialism practiced by the U.S. has replaced neocolonialism, it is our duty to rediscover what Indian historian Vijay Prashad called ""the Bandung Spirit"" and critically re-engage with notions of sovereignty, human rights, and the international economic order.

The version of sovereignty and international relations that we have in mind is the one that relies on the ""Five Principles of Coexistence,"" which include (1) mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, (2) non-aggression, (3) non-interference in internal affairs, (4) equality and mutual benefit, and (5) peaceful coexistence."

Editor's note: Andrew Korybko is a Moscow-based American political analyst. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

U.S. President Joe Biden addressed the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday about a broad range of issues. He deserves praise for committing his country to the international community's efforts to combat climate change and COVID-19.

These were the high marks of speech, but unfortunately, he sullied all of that by lying to everyone when he said that the U.S. doesn't want a new Cold War. The reality is that the U.S. is already in a new Cold War with China characterized by an intense hybrid warfare campaign against it.

Biden claims that the U.S. will cooperate with any country that shares America's supposedly peaceful intentions, but that isn't true when it comes to China. Not only has he aggressively sought to contain the country through a wide range of means stretching from the economic to the military and even informational, but the American leader has also meddled in China's internal affairs.

No clearer evidence of this exists than him exploiting that global podium to attack China for its counterterrorism and deradicalization measures in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.

According to him, these measures represent the ""oppression"" of a minority group. He also alluded to that twice earlier in his speech when he warned about emerging technologies being used to deepen repression, especially against minorities.

The U.S. has accused China of such deeds for several years, each time without a sliver of evidence of it using its world-class technological systems to oppress the Uygurs, which isn't true at all but nevertheless has become one of the leading mainstream media narratives for discrediting China.

It was also highly hypocritical of him to say that America doesn't want to divide the world into competing blocs, yet that's exactly what it's doing with the Quad or the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, and most recently, the new alliance between the U.S., Australia and the UK (AUKUS)."
1312,UN should reclaim its mandate to enforce peace,"Editor's note: Stephen Ndegwa is a Nairobi-based communication expert, lecturer-scholar at the United States International University-Africa, author and international affairs columnist. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

The General Debate of the 76th session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) is underway in New York. As the main agenda-setting organ of the UN, the deliberations and outcomes of this veritable global meeting elicit a lot of interest and curiosity alike.

With the world facing unprecedented and seemingly insurmountable challenges in recent years, which have peaked with the COVID-19 pandemic, the UN is the last hope to help us avoid reaching the tipping point. There seems to be no relenting in the downward spiral, with climate change gradually taking up the space left by the plateauing pandemic.

Among other issues, UNGA 2021 is expected to discuss the fight against COVID-19, inequality, justice and climate change. Now, the common denominator in all these and other issues that will be canvassed is global peace. The establishment today is unfair to countries and regions that do not serve the strategic interests of hegemonic entities and those without sufficient resources to mitigate the ripple effects of the negative actions of those with superpower status.

By coincidence, the UNGA is gathering at a time the world is marking the International Day of Peace, which is celebrated annually on September 21. This year's theme is ""Recovering better for an equitable and sustainable world.""

Peace is not necessarily the absence of war. By its definition, peace is an all-encompassing state of being that includes friendship and harmony, and freedom from fear of violence. The practice of these values by the international community would create a world with benefits for humanity, with every significant player considering win-win outcomes in every endeavor."
1313,Mid-Autumn Festival: Separating so that others can unite,"Willingly, people give up certain freedoms in exchange for the health and safety of their family and community. Deep down in such conscience is the ethos of family unity and loyalty in the Chinese culture, an essential element in crisis resolution. In Chinese culture, family bonds and mutual help motivate people to work hard and empowers them to be stronger and better. The same mindset and sentiment bring people home for a reunion during the Mid-Autumn Festival, no matter how far from their family or homeland they are. Their longing for reunion is represented in a circle, a prominent yet simple symbol – the moon. Likewise, the willingness to cooperate and sacrifice oneself, rather than just protecting one's interest, is helpful to the prosperity of one's home and community. This is why when the Delta variant emerged in Fujian Province, everyone, including children, observed the quarantine protocol.

Editor's note: Wang Yan is an associate research fellow at Beijing Foreign Studies University. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN. Mid-Autumn Festival is the most significant festival in China, as people get together with their family to moon gaze, eat moon cakes and enjoy shared joy under the light of the fullest moon of the year. Thanks to China's success in combating COVID-19, people can celebrate the festival in delight. China has the lowest number of cases in treatment and the highest recovery rate compared with many other countries. Behind such success are effective and strict screening, social distancing and quarantining protocols that the Chinese people have observed since the outbreak of the COVID-19. People of all ages have their health QR codes scanned and temperature checked wherever they go. If someone does not have their cell phone with them at the checkpoint, their home address, ID number and cell phone number will be collected for further tracking in case of necessity.

In Fujian Province, children as young as four years old walked into quarantine rooms on their own, wearing hazmat suits and carrying heavy suitcases. To them, they're observing the norm, just like everyone else. The people around the kids have set an example for them, making them aware that this is the right way to guarantee a safe living community.



Realistically, the conscience related to family unity and loyalty is realized through self-discipline that has been cultivated through education and fostered in the Chinese culture.



The cultivation of the ethical self is a principal objective of education as per Chinese culture, expressed as ""a man won't be well-educated until an ethical self is accomplished."" Chinese education emphasizes self-discipline, which is regarded as an integral part of character building and an essential foundation of grit that determines one's success.



In Chinese culture, there is an old saying, ""Xiushen qijia zhiguo pingtianxia."" It means a peaceful world is premised on a well-governed country or nation, which starts with cultivating the ethical self and having one's family organized. It is also the ideal that every intellectual pursues. All great aspiration starts with cultivating oneself in concert with others through diligence, discipline and collaboration.



While individualism teaches one to care about oneself first and care about others as much as one pleases, collectivism in Chinese families means that one should sacrifice oneself for the good of the entire family. Indeed, social order and well-being are built upon the moral conduct of individual members.



This will be a special Mid-Autumn Festival for the children and adults separated from their families. But in the end, they will all reunite with their family. As the Chinese saying goes, ""Despite being thousands of miles apart, we are still united under one moon.""

Despite the physical distance due to quarantine, familial bonds will still be strengthened. Years later, when the children grow up, they will recall, like many others, that they once walked into quarantine rooms with courage and love during the Mid-Autumn Festival, and they will dedicate themselves to building a prosperous nation and a beautiful world.

1314,Vaccine producers must step up,"Editor's note: Jeffrey D. Sachs is the Director of the Center for Sustainable Development at Columbia University and President of the UN Sustainable Development Solutions Network. The article reflects the author's opinions, and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

The world stands at a critical juncture of the COVID-19 pandemic. Countries that lack the first round of vaccine coverage are extraordinarily vulnerable to the highly infectious Delta variant, and are also seedbeds for new variants that could quickly spread worldwide. The Lancet COVID-19 Commission, which I chair, is working urgently with the United Nations system to strengthen the multilateral response. Governments of countries where vaccines are being produced – the United States, European Union members, the United Kingdom, India, Russia, and China – need to cooperate under UN leadership to ensure that a sufficient supply of vaccine doses reaches the poorest countries.

The high-income countries now have more than 50 percent of their population fully vaccinated. Yet the fully vaccinated population in Africa remains under 4 percent. This lack of vaccine coverage in Africa, and in low-income countries elsewhere, poses an imminent danger to these populations.

U.S. President Joe Biden has called for a vaccine summit on September 22. This is potentially a highly significant step forward. It is important that the U.S. should hold this meeting in cooperation with China, India, Russia, and the other vaccine-producing countries, and with the UN system. Only the UN, with its universal membership and its operational capacity in low-income countries, has the ability to coordinate the rapid global scale-up of vaccine coverage.

In April 2020, the UN created the COVID-19 Vaccine Global Access (COVAX) facility to provide vaccines to lower-income countries. These countries expected COVAX to provide timely deliveries. Yet COVAX has been unable to buy a sufficient volume of vaccine doses mainly because high-income countries have repeatedly cut to the front of the queue. Moreover, the vaccine-producing countries' governments have imposed export quotas so that COVAX is often unable to secure even the vaccines for which it has contracts. The company shareholders are of course happy with these arrangements, because the rich countries pay more for the doses than COVAX would.

The supply crisis facing low-income countries in Africa and elsewhere will not resolve itself. On the contrary, high-income countries are now beginning to offer a third dose, even before highly vulnerable groups in the poorest countries (the elderly, health workers, the immunocompromised, and others) have received their primary vaccination.

Global opportunities for scaling up vaccine production are also being hampered by some governments' continued insistence on enforcing the patents on key vaccine technologies, even though these patents are held by academic institutions that were funded by the governments (notably by the U.S. National Institutes of Health). Likewise, public money funded the clinical trials and rollout of the vaccines. Despite the global urgency of the pandemic, life-saving public goods have been privatized."
1315,The corporate capture of UN food summit,"Editor's note: Sofia Monsalve, secretary-general of FIAN International, is a member of the International Panel of Experts on Sustainable Food Systems. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

When I visited my parents in Bogota last month, I witnessed how people in their neighborhood went up and down the streets begging for help to survive. Since the end of April, Colombia has experienced one of its biggest waves of social unrest in recent times – and hunger is at the core of the protests. South Africa experienced similar turmoil in July.

Growing hunger is creating volatility in many countries, compounding the devastating social and economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the climate crisis. According to recent United Nations figures, the pandemic has increased the number of hungry people by as many as 161 million, to 811 million. Nearly one in three people – almost 2.4 billion – lack access to adequate nutrition.

Given the lack of progress toward ending global hunger and malnutrition by 2030, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres will convene a Food Systems Summit in New York on September 23. The meeting has been billed as an opportunity to discuss bold new measures that will transform the way the world produces, consumes and thinks about food.

But the summit has been marred by controversy from the outset, largely owing to the influence of corporate interests in framing the agenda in what critics have described as an attempt to privatize decision-making. The UN set the pre-summit agenda in partnership with the World Economic Forum, placing key corporate players in leading roles. For example, the Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN), a Swiss-based foundation, leads the summit's work on eradicating hunger. One of GAIN's donors is the pesticide producer BASF, which seeks to portray itself as a ""Food Systems Hero.""

UN human rights experts have been damning in their criticism of the process, which has sidelined the UN's Committee on World Food Security (CFS). Discussions at the CFS include hundreds of representatives of smallholder farmers, fisherfolk, indigenous people and civil-society groups. Michael Fakhri, the UN special rapporteur on the right to food, has echoed the complaints of grassroots farming groups – more than 500 of which are boycotting the summit – likening corporations' excessive influence over the gathering to ""inviting the fox right into the henhouse.""

Smallholder farmers, peasants, fisherfolk, pastoralists and indigenous people feed most of the world's population with little or no access to corporate supply chains. About 80 percent of farms are smaller than two hectares, and cover about 12 percent of the world's farmland, while the largest one percent of agribusiness farms control more than 70 percent of farmland."
1316,The Day of Peace won't change the U.S. instinct for meddling and war,"Editor's note: CGTN's First Voice provides instant commentary on breaking stories. The daily column clarifies emerging issues and better defines the news agenda, offering a Chinese perspective on the latest global events.

September 21 marks the International Day of Peace, but if you come from the United States, you may never have heard of it.

And for good reason. None of the nearly 80 million Americans born after 2001 have known a day of peace in their lifetimes. For them, drone assassinations, missile strikes and the background noise of perpetual war is all they have ever known. Although the U.S. is home to the United Nations headquarters, multilateralism and the pursuit of peace are not its favored tools for diplomacy. The U.S. has long preferred the threat and unilateral use of force.

In fact, the U.S. has only known peace for 17 years since it was founded in 1776.

In 2020 alone, it spent $778 billion on its military, triple the expenditure of China and accounting for 39 percent of global military spending. This money paid for the most advanced military in the world, with bases in around 70 countries. If you are a hammer, everything looks like a nail. With such a huge amount of money going toward military spending, the U.S. looks at all problems through a military lens.

For historical reasons, the U.S. likes to consider itself an exceptional nation, set apart from others by destiny or providence. Americans see themselves as a beacon of hope for the world to look up to, a shining city on a hill. Americans deeply feel that other nations all desire to be like the United States.

This is why former U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney was able to say on television in 2003 that U.S. troops would ""be greeted as liberators"" after they invaded Iraq – even though this had no basis in fact. The Americans, to their shock surprise, were greeted with improvised explosive devices."
1317,Trudeau's Gamble,"Editor's note: Freddie Reidy is a freelance writer based in London. He studied history and art history at the University of Kent, Canterbury, specializing in Russian history and international politics. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

Polls opened in Canada on September 20 are expected to be a major test for incumbent Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. When the snap election was called, Trudeau was riding high in the polls, but what led the prime minister to roll the electoral dice, and why have the odds narrowed over the course of the campaign?

Trudeau reasoned that his decision to hold a snap election was to give Canadians the opportunity to shape their own post-COVID-19 future. The Liberal leader said, ""In this pivotal, consequential moment, who wouldn't want a say? Who wouldn't want a chance to decide where our country goes from here?""

To those in Trudeau's inner circle, it might have seemed an ideal opportunity to capitalize on the positive voter sentiment toward the government's handling of the pandemic. The polls looked promising for Trudeau, and it was a chance to regain the majority the party lost in parliament in 2019. Furthermore, Trudeau's main rival, Conservative leader Erin O'Toole had been in the job for only a year and was little known.

Though what O'Toole lacks in experience, he makes up for in strategy. Aware of his low profile, the Conservative leader successfully articulated the national sentiment by attacking the very premise of the election as the nation entered a fourth coronavirus wave, saying, ""Now's not the time for an election. We can wait and go to the polls when it's safe,"" according to BBC.

Beyond the electoral rationale, another structural flaw was exposed. Even critics would concede that Prime Minister Trudeau's carefully managed personal image is the center of his party's ideological fortunes. The incumbent, therefore, not only staked his personal political future on a snap election but also that of his brand of liberalism – a brand that has been under greater scrutiny than ever before during the campaign. He has drawn criticism over the years from certain quarters, accusing him of being a popinjay for famously sporting garish socks, cultivating a fashionable beard and frequently appearing without a tie in a bid to appear more relatable. Other gimmicks famously include directing a female journalist to use the term ""peoplekind"" rather than ""mankind"" during a town hall meeting press conference.

However, during the campaign, Canada's first black party leader Annamie Paul of the Green Party, stated in a televised debate that she did ""not believe that Mr Trudeau is a real feminist"" because ""a feminist doesn't continue to push strong women out of his party when they are just seeking to serve."""

Editor's note: Bobby Naderi is a London-based journalist, guest contributor in print, radio and television, and documentary filmmaker. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

The United States, the United Kingdom and Australia have come up with ""a new enhanced trilateral security partnership"" that allegedly seeks strategic engagement with China in the Asia-Pacific region.

Censured by China as a ""geopolitical gaming tool"" that makes no sense for Australia or the Asia-Pacific at all, the nuke sub deal, dubbed AUKUS, is allegedly designed to curb China from a ""position of strength,"" which is demonstrably wishful thinking. It will see Australia, the U.S. and the UK share advanced technologies with one another.

Under the plan, Australia may conduct routine patrols through areas of the South China Sea and near China's Taiwan region. It's the clearest signal yet that, following the debacle in Afghanistan, the Biden administration is anxious to pivot U.S. foreign policy around competition with China and help its losing commanders save face.

Perhaps important is the message that's been sent to the international community through this misbegotten venture of the first order. The provocative move may weaken the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), with significant implications for an unnecessary arms race in the Asia-Pacific. It is essentially guaranteed that the region would remain unstable and imbalanced – not necessarily in AUKUS's favor though.

It should be noted that not many people in Australia are in favor of a nuclear arms race, or a new Cold War in the Asia-Pacific. AUKUS means more U.S. weaponry and more boots on Australian ground. The public view is that the submarine announcement may not be right for Australia. Nuclear energy has no economic or political merits, nor would it be a timely response to climate change.

Into the argument, Australia would need to safely store and dispose of radioactive waste. This appears unlikely, given the public opposition to establishing a site to dispose of nuclear waste. Let's face it: There is little community support for nuclear power in Australia, especially following the Fukushima disaster."
1319,AUKUS is the latest form of U.S. imperialist aggression against China,"Editor's note: Andrew Korybko is a Moscow-based American political analyst. The article reflects the author's views and not necessarily those of CGTN.

The unveiling last week of new Australia-UK-U.S. (AUKUS) trilateral military alliance prompted intense criticism across the world, including from those countries' French ally which just lost out on a AU$90-billion submarine deal with Canberra to London and Washington.

Many observers rightly remarked that AUKUS is aggressively meant to provoke China in the Asia-Pacific. They also drew attention to it showing just how unreliable the U.S. is as an ally that it would backstab France by negotiating this alliance in secret without its knowledge and then stealing what that country's media previously referred to as the ""Contract of the Century.""

There's another analytical layer to all of this as well though and it's that AUKUS confirms that the U.S. is practicing an imperialist policy. This isn't just rhetoric either but an objective reflection of the facts based on Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne's surprisingly candid revelation. According to the U.S. State Department's transcript of the press conference that she participated in alongside her American counterpart and their defense ministers, she said that the contemporary state of their alliance ""is well suited to cooperate on countering economic coercion.""

This very strongly implies that AUKUS is a military response to economic competition from China. One of Russian communist revolutionary Vladimir Lenin's most famous works, ""Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism,"" theorizes that imperialist states employ military means in order to advance self-interested economic ends.

That's precisely what's happening with AUKUS, except their Chinese target isn't a fellow imperialist power like the other three countries, but is the world's leading anti-imperialist force. Nevertheless, the connection between imperialism, capitalism and militarism is still relevant."

Editor's note: Hamzah Rifaat Hussain, former visiting fellow at the Stimson Center in Washington and former assistant researcher at the Islamabad Policy Research Institute, is a TV anchor at Indus News in Pakistan. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN. Right after forging the controversial ""Allies Alliance,"" which has earned the ire of France with countries such as New Zealand not expected to follow suit, the U.S. Navy conducted a two missile test launch involving the nuclear Trident D5LE from the USS Wyoming.

The ballistic missile submarine completed the tests off the coast of Cape Canaveral in Florida, which are a part of a shakedown operation termed ""DASO 31."" The launch demonstrates how 184 missile test flights were successfully conducted. Yet, at the same time, this decision to test nuclear missiles with strategic posturing directed at China is an affront to the nuclear nonproliferation government. The reasons are obvious. If examined further, the planned DASO exercise will be conducted with the sole aim of gauging the health and durability of ballistic nuclear missile submarines. The nuclear dimensions involved in the operations complemented by the provocative alliance of Australia, the UK and the U.S. (AUKUS) pose further questions as to whether such American experiments would reinforce or challenge peace and stability across the globe. It is undeniable that strategic deterrence and a global understanding that nuclear weapons deployment challenges balances of power are critical for world peace. Yet, General Johnny R. Wolff, director of the U.S. Navy's Strategic Systems Program, claimed that there are further plans to develop a next-generation Trident weapons system that will enhance America's strategic deterrence at sea for the next 63 years. The question is about the exact threat that the U.S. is seeking to thwart with such comprehensive deterrence. The answer lies in the timing of the tests, which is critical given that the problematic AUKUS alliance was just inked. While the U.S. Navy has denied that these tests are a response to unfolding global events, the fact is that the fleets of 14 American Ohio-class submarines continue to carry 24 Trident missiles with eight nuclear warheads.

Editor's note: John Gong is a professor at the University of International Business and Economics and a research fellow at the Academy of China Open Economy Studies at UIBE. The article reflects the author's views and not necessarily those of CGTN. The formation of AUKUS, which is billed as a new geopolitical and security partnership among the U.S., the UK and Australia to coordinate on cyber issues, advanced technologies and defense in order to counter security challenges in the Indo-Pacific, seen by many as a metaphor for China, appears on the surface to be a major strategic shift in Washington's alliance-based China policy.

But digging deeper, there are indications to show that this is mostly about money – a naked pretense to a grab prey from a weaker predator, and thus it may not be interpreted too much out of context from a geopolitical perspective, although its viciousness and maliciousness from a commercial dealing ethics perspective should be widely condemned by the international community. The center of the AUKUS pack is the submarine deal. The U.S. and the UK will help Australia build and maintain nuclear-powered submarines, making it potentially the seventh country in the world to acquire such powerful underwater capability. But it also shred apart an existing deal worth $66 billion under which Australia is supposed to purchase 12 Attack-class conventional submarines from France's Naval Group. Paris went ballistic on hearing the news; its Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian called the AUKUS deal a ""stab in the back,"" ""a brutal, unilateral and unpredictable decision that reminded him of former president Donald Trump."" Paris later recalled its ambassadors to the U.S. and Australian in retaliation. But interestingly, French ambassador to Britain has saved the trip back home. Le Monde newspaper called the decision to not recall him an ""odd exception."" According to a report in Washington Post on September 18th quoting a French diplomatic official, ""the UK tagged along with this entire operation opportunistically,"" and was seen by Paris as a junior partner in the three-nation defense pact.

1328,Why do efforts to disintegrate China-Africa relationship fare badly?,"Editor's note: Azhar Azam works in a private organization as market and business analyst and writes about geopolitical issues and regional conflicts. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily those of CGTN.

Every year, China hosts around 1,000 African professionals, including journalists and 80,000 students – double the size of those who travel to the U.S., making it the top training and education destination for Africa. Second only to France, the East Asian country has launched 62 language and cultural centers (Confucius Institutes) on the continent.

Besides overtaking the British Council, Germany's Goethe Institute and the American Centers, China displaced the U.S. as Africa's largest trade partner in 2009, with the bilateral trade hitting as high as $200 billion in 2020.

Over the last decade, Beijing played a central role in financing and became the largest financer of infrastructure in Africa, covering 6,000 kilometers of railways and highways, 20 ports, 80 large-scale power facilities, 130 medical institutions, 45 stadiums and 170 schools.

A number of studies have rebuffed claims about China's alleged predatory lending practices, neocolonialism, pillage of natural resources, land grabs and import of Chinese workers for construction projects. The independent investigations further found Chinese firms were hiring up to 90 percent local workforce and ""really"" investing and developing African infrastructure.

It is often contended that bilateral trade benefits China more than Africa. The latest trade data debunked this assertion, showing that Chinese imports from its all-season ally had risen by 46.3 percent in the first seven months of the year. Over the last 20 years, flow of Chinese investments in Africa has also surged by more than 25 percent on a yearly-average basis, hitting $2.1 billion for the period.

Still, Beijing's approach to create new bonds of affinity with Africa and African people continues to vex the observers. They view China's unreserved engagement in Africa as an effort to build ""soft power,"" secure financial interests, gain a strategic sphere of influence and galvanize support on multilateral forums.

Even though China-Africa Peace and Security Forum extended commitment to common, comprehensive, collaborative and sustainable security, the initiative to shape Africa's peacekeeping capacity, strengthen defense and military cooperation and channel funds through the United Nations Peace and Development Trust Fund are irrationally linked with gaining a strong foothold in the continent.

The bloody conflicts in many parts of Africa, such as Lake Chad Basin, Mozambique's Cabo Delgado, Gulf of Guiana, Somalia and Ethiopian Tigray, threaten to impede economic growth. Beijing's security inputs have assisted the region to achieve peace and security objectives to advance a sustainable socioeconomic development.

For African nations, China's development model to push growth and alleviate poverty offers a definitive version for modernization and transformation of regional economies. The unique mix of transparent, accountable and rules-based cooperation serves the core interests of the continent and the people.

Beijing is neither part of any global competition to dominate Africa nor does it want to capture the continent. What fascinates African states is China's inspirational development, whose experience the world's second largest economy has been more than willing to share, to drive Africa to forge its own economic path.

The growing Chinese influence stokes fears in the U.S. for being sidelined by China on the continent. Washington tried best to contaminate the minds of African governments about Chinese technological companies. However, most of them haven't succumbed to the U.S. bullying as at least 266 Chinese technology initiatives are underway across the region.

Africa seeks to harness digital technologies and innovation to transform societies and economies to promote regional integration, speed up economic growth, stimulate job creation and break the digital divide for socioeconomic development.

China's commitment to foster digital collaboration, ranging from 5G to data centers, smart cities and skills and education programs, is deliberately advertised as a threat to Africa's security and sovereignty."
1329,Hong Kong is up and running again,"Editor's note: CGTN's First Voice provides instant commentary on breaking stories. The daily column clarifies emerging issues and better defines the news agenda, offering a Chinese perspective on the latest global events.

The results of the 2021 Election Committee's subsector ordinary elections in China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) were unveiled on September 20 morning: 364 people made it to the committee.

This was the first election held in the HKSAR following the disruption posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. The region's Electoral Committee is endowed with important functions under the region's improved electoral system, which includes nominating candidates for the chief executive election, electing the chief executive designate, nominating candidates for the Legislative Council (LegCo) election and electing part of LegCo members.

Despite what critics say, the new electoral system in the HKSAR is a firm demonstration of how the city is upholding democracy, stability and prosperity in line with ""One Country, Two Systems,"" tailored to the city's unique needs and as stipulated by the Basic Law. It has also established a way forward as a safeguard to ensure that those who govern the city will be patriots, and not those sponsored by foreign forces who seek to undermine, sabotage or damage the system.

Hong Kong is a region of China which has been granted a ""high degree of autonomy"" in managing its affairs, which include its own free market economic system, a legal system as well as its own local bureaucracy. In order to handle these matters, the city has its own institutions including the chief executive, the legislative council and district councils. Likewise, it has long been established that a process of local democracy is utilized in order to elect their officials, which citizens and various societal groups in the region participate in.

However, these institutions have recently run into difficulty as they have frequently become targets of foreign powers who sought to utilize the features of local democracy not to simply handle local affairs on a policy level, but as a medium to promote separatism, secessionism, subversion and to undermine China itself. The HKSAR institutions were never designed to promote the idea that the city was ""not"" a part of China or to become a platform for sponsoring unrest or infiltration. Yet, this is what it had become over the past few years with the onset of the riots."

Editor's note: Hayat Bangash is a freelance columnist on international affairs with degrees in business administration and war studies. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

The joint statement of the new security alliance of Australia, the UK and the U.S. (AUKUS) once again brought into light a term that has remained elusive ever since its seepage into Western strategic discourse. The international rules-based order, as it is called, is yet to find a clear definition despite its increased usage since the turn of the century.

As the U.S. has disengaged from its wars in the Middle East and Afghanistan, its focus has turned toward limiting China's peaceful economic rise. Allusions of rules-based order have thereon been largely used to interpret the global governance system as per the wishes of the U.S.

Shirley V. Scott, an Australian academic in international law, has extensively documented how America's allies have mimicked and exaggerated ""the rhetorical shift from international law to rules-based order."" Over the years, Australia and the UK's national security documents as well as their leaders' speeches have been dropping the use of the former concept in favor of the latter.

There is, of course, a method to that shift. U.S. leadership of the so-called free world is somehow symbolized by the rules-based order, which the U.S., along with its allies, considers something to be protected as it deliberately avoids mentions of international law.

If U.S. policymakers continue to talk about upholding international law, the first fingers will be pointed right back at them. Unilateral American sanctions will be stamped as economic warfare, ignoring the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) to invade countries will mean unwarrantable aggression, and refusing to sign a multitude of international treaties while advocating others for the opposite will plainly come off as American exceptionalism.

The references to rules-based order had gathered steam after the invasion of Iraq in 2003, as charted by University of Chicago Professor Paul Post. Since the invasion sidestepped the only institution established as an inhibitor to such belligerence, the UNSC, it could not be defended under international law.

An embrace of this new expression thus came in handy. The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan continued unrelentingly despite the circumvention of the UN and the drummed-up charges of weapons of mass destruction. The U.S. went on claiming that it was liberating countries and a system was offered – to quote the international relations theorist G. John Ikenberry – where America rules the world but does not abide by the rules.

Now that American wars in impoverished countries are winding up, upholding the rules-based order has morphed into a euphemism for counteracting China.

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken stated in May that the purpose of the Biden administration is not to ""contain China, to hold it back, to keep it down."" As the administration chose to retain many of the irrational policies of the previous American president, the purpose has proven to be anything but."
1331,Can the Beijing Stock Exchange spur innovation and inclusive growth?,"Editor's note: Alexander Ayertey Odonkor is an economic consultant, chartered financial analyst and chartered economist with an in-depth understanding of the economic landscape of countries in Asia and Africa. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

The Beijing Stock Exchange opened its doors for registration of investors on September 17, 2021. The new stock exchange is the Chinese mainland's third bourse after the Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE) and the Shenzhen Stock Exchange (SZSE), which were established in 1990.

Designed to support innovative startups and high-growth small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), this securities market has been instrumental in strengthening access to finance for SMEs in China.

While SMEs are an integral component of the Chinese economy, the growth of some of these businesses is usually hampered by financial constraints – a major challenge that the global economy has been grappling with for many years. Considered as the backbone of any development model, a robust SMEs sector fosters innovation and promotes an inclusive green growth which is essential for achieving sustainable development. Typically, SMEs represent the largest share of all enterprises; this situation is not different in China.

In China, SMEs account for over 90 percent of all businesses, provide 80 percent of total jobs and contribute more than 60 percent of the country's gross domestic product (GDP).

Serving as an engine of growth and a major driver of innovation, the collective contribution of SMEs to China's patents exceeds 70 percent of the country's total.

As a result of the considerable contribution of SMEs in research and development (R&D), China once again emerged as the world's top filer of international patents in 2020 with 68,720 applications, representing a 16.1 percent increase over the previous year.

In spite of the significant contributions of the SMEs sector to the Chinese economy, the growth of many of these enterprises has been retarded mainly as a result of financial constraint, which is limiting the innovation capacity of SMEs in the country. However, in recent years policymakers in China have been consistent in their approach to address this exigent challenge in an effort to spur innovation and boost inclusive growth."

Editor's note: Daryl Guppy is an international financial technical analysis expert and national board member of the Australia China Business Council, who has provided weekly Shanghai Index analysis for mainland Chinese media for more than a decade. He also appears regularly on CNBC Asia and is known as ""The Chart Man."" The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison has done more to undermine the Western alliance than any adversary has been able to achieve since NATO was founded.

Australia's decision to cancel the French deal to build a new Australian submarine force was supported by NATO foundation allies. Australia's replacement submarine will come from either the United States or the UK.

Jean-Yves Le Drian, the French foreign minister said, ""this is a stab in the back"" delivered by NATO allies at the behest of Australia.

This decision was never directly relayed to Emmanuel Marcon. He found out from the media, undermining the trust that is the foundation of the NATO agreement. In June, Macron described the contract as a ""pillar of the partnership and of the relationship of trust between the two countries."" Now Macron feels betrayed by a ""friend"" and two foundational partners of NATO.

U.S. President Joe Biden is generating a distrust factor almost as great as former President Donald Trump. NATO adversaries could only dream of creating this type of split.

Generally, nation states do not walk away from or default on multibillion-dollar commercial deals with other nation states because this sends the wrong signal to the international investment community. The higher the perceived sovereign risk, the more expensive it is for the country to borrow on international credit markets and the more reluctant business is to invest in the country.

Australia has already started down this path with the introduction of legislation that allows the Foreign Investment Review Board to retrospectively overturn investment decisions and force companies to divest these investments years after the first commercial decision had been made. The potential overturning of the Darwin Port lease is the next test of commercial trust.

Walking away from the French submarine deal is a significant event. This is a repudiation of a state-to-state commercial arrangement and begs the most important investment question: Can Australia be trusted?

The immediate answer is that it cannot be trusted to honor its commercial commitments. The countries scattered throughout the Indo-Pacific region, the region Australia coverts, have been delivered a strong message in relation to trust and the risk of doing business with Australia.

Australia's lack of commitment to the evacuation of all Afghan interpreters and support staff who had worked for the Australians had already caused some disquiet in the region. Australia backed its fine-sounding words about support with actions that were too little and delivered too late."
1333,Hong Kong's improved electoral system offers people real hope,"Editor's note: Grenville Cross, a senior counsel and law professor, was previously director of public prosecutions of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), China. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily those of CGTN.

In 2020-21, there will, over a seven-month period, be three sets of elections in Hong Kong, each highly significant. Whereas the elections for the 1,500-member Hong Kong Special Administration Region (HKSAR) Election Committee are taking place on September 19, 2021, these will be followed by the Legislative Council elections on December 19, and the Chief Executive election on March 27, 2022.

Elections as a means of choosing the city's officials are enshrined in the Basic Law. It describes universal suffrage as the ""ultimate aim"" in the choosing of both the Chief Executive and the Legislative Council, although disruptive elements have frustrated the process. But, despite recent difficulties, this objective remains unchanged.

The coming elections are the first since the National People's Congress overhauled the electoral system in March, and put the city back on track. After anti-China forces declared war on society in 2019-20, reform became unavoidable. If the ""one country, two systems"" governing policy for Hong Kong had not been improved, it could have failed altogether. This, of course, was exactly what some people wanted, as they knew this would advance the policy agendas of China's geopolitical rivals, to whom they were beholden.

This was why, for example, the district council seats had to be removed from the Election Committee. Under the Basic Law (Art.97), district organizations are ""not organs of political power"", yet their seats fell into the hands of people obsessed with political posturing and anti-China activity. Systematic abuse was poisoning the body politic, and could no longer be tolerated. Changes, therefore, were essential to ensure that the electoral system produced responsible governance, not political mayhem.

On March 11, the Chinese Premier Li Keqiang explained that the electoral reforms would help Hong Kong to remain stable and prosperous, which was exactly what most people wanted to hear. He said that ""to insist on 'patriots administering Hong Kong' is to ensure the long-term implementation of one country, two systems"", and this was quite true.

Although the Central authorities could have despaired over the chaos, they retained their faith in Hong Kong and its capacity to turn things round. They recognized how external forces were encouraging their local proxies to wreck the city, believing this would undermine China.

The Election Committee that is now being formed will comprise 982 elected members, 156 nominated members, and 362 ex officio members. In early August, the HKSAR government announced that it had received 1,056 nominations for the contested seats, compared to 1,539 at the last vote in 2016. The lower figure this time is not surprising, as many of those who stood previously have now realized that their brand of fanaticism has had its day.

The Election Committee has been expanded from 1,200 to 1,500 members, with a 300-seat fifth sub-sector added to the existing four sub-sectors, each also comprising 300 seats. This has made it more representative, and it allows more voices to be heard.

There is, for example, now room for people with national perspectives and cross-border experience, including local members of the NPC, the CPPCC and the representatives of associations of Hong Kong residents in the Chinese mainland. Although this has obviously made the body less parochial, full regard has nonetheless been had to local conditions. Indeed, Wang Chen, vice chairman of the NPC Standing Committee, has noted that its design is ""aimed to form a new democratic electoral system suited to Hong Kong's realities, and with Hong Kong characteristics"".

The Election Committee's functions include choosing the Chief Executive, electing 40 of the 90 members to the Legislative Council, and nominating its other members. Although its immediate concerns are with local governance, there are also national ramifications. Quite clearly, therefore, these responsibilities can only be discharged by trustworthy individuals who have the country's best interests at heart, and not by people allied to foreign powers. In other words, they must be patriotic and committed to defending national security."
1334,How a 'righteous strike' became a 'horrible mistake',"When a drone attack on August 29 led to the deaths of 10 people, including seven children, U.S. officials quickly called it a ""righteous strike."" They insisted the American military had authorized the attack after tracking Zamarai Ahmadi, who had driven a sedan around Kabul for hours before parking outside a supposed ISIS-K safe house. They further claimed that items being placed inside Ahmadi's car could be used in another terrorist attack against the U.S. military, who were bogged down at the Hamid Karzai International Airport trying to complete the massive evacuation of American diplomats and private citizens from the U.S. and Afghanistan. In truth, the items being placed in the car were nothing more than water jugs.

Entman found that the U.S. media accepted the U.S. government's assertions that immediately pointed the finger of blame directly at the Kremlin for the tragedy involving the South Korean plane. Five years later, they ascribed no such blame to the White House for the actions of the U.S. military. The media framed the story consistent with the narrative they had created about the two nations. The Soviet Union was an amoral country that placed no value on human life while the United States was led by honorable people who would never deliberately kill private citizens.

Robert Entman examined news reporting of two horrific events: the shooting down of a Korean Air Lines plane by a Soviet military jet in 1983 and the shooting down of an Iran Air flight by the U.S. military five years later. The events were eerily similar: Hundreds of innocent people died because a military leader authorized a strike on a passenger plane that had no chance to avoid its fate.

It was 30 years ago when a leading communication scholar published a seminal article looking at how the U.S. government and military can influence news coverage.

Editor's note: Anthony Moretti is an associate professor at the Department of Communication and Organizational Leadership of Robert Morris University. The article reflects the author's views and not necessarily those of CGTN.

The U.S.-authorized strike happened just days after a deadly attack carried out by ISIS-K killed at least 170 Afghan civilians, and 13 U.S. service members, at the gates of the airport. The military increased the palpable fear throughout the city (and in the U.S.) by saying they believed ISIS-K would try to carry out further attacks before the evacuation efforts ended at the end of August.

The bitter reality is that ISIS-K had carried out a terrorist attack, and it was eager to do it again. The even more bitter reality is that Ahmadi and the nine other people killed in the U.S. drone strike were not terrorists. They were innocent people, and seven of them were kids.

As I listened to the news on Friday, I had a ""here we go again"" moment. The military was again apologizing profusely for a ""horrible mistake."" And I knew that at some point in the future the mainstream U.S. media would get in line and back the military's new narrative.

The irony was it was some of those same U.S. news agencies that had blown apart the ""righteous strike"" story, which forced the military to acknowledge the terrible error they had made.

The evidence that the U.S. military had made that ""horrible mistake"" began to be uncovered almost instantly. But the military remained silent, even though multiple news organizations had pieced together what had happened and demanded the military respond to it. The Washington Post reported Ahmadi was doing nothing more than carrying out ""mundane errands against the backdrop of the city's humanitarian crisis"" in the hours before he was murdered.

The general who issued the apology on Friday was already beginning to promote the ""honorable America"" theme. According to the Washington Post, ""Gen. Kenneth 'Frank' McKenzie, who heads U.S. Central Command and had oversight of the Afghanistan mission as it came to an end last month, said Friday that officials were assessing whether anyone would be held responsible for the errant strike. The U.S. government, McKenzie added, is discussing 'ex gratia' payments to compensate the victims' families.""

Of course, there will be investigations in Washington. Republicans will attempt to blame President Joe Biden for failed leadership, while Democrats will suggest in the chaos that was Kabul that decent men and women can do something that in hindsight was found to be wrong. There will be talk of filing charges against one or more people, but that will never happen. Promises will be made about being more cautious in the future. Life will carry on.

Now just imagine how official Washington would be reacting if a certain other country had murdered 10 people in cold blood. They would demand international investigations. They would quickly announce sanctions against multiple people. They would ask the International Criminal Court to uncover the truth. But none of that will be of interest because what happened in Kabul was just a ""horrible mistake.""

Editor's note: Yuan Sha is an assistant research fellow in the Department for American Studies, the China Institute of International Studies. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

Chinese President Xi Jinping on Friday delivered important remarks at the 21st Meeting of the Council of Heads of State of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) via video link, where he took stock of the achievements of the organization in the last 20 years and laid his vision for its future. His speech gives insight into what the SCO is and what it's not.

What the SCO is

The SCO is an organization for countries in Central Asia and the immediate region. Since its establishment 20 years ago, the organization has made remarkable achievements and acquired growing prominence. It is time to evaluate what the SCO is and what it aims to do.

President Xi answered the questions succinctly, stressing that the SCO explored a new ground both theoretically and practically, with a goal of building a new type of international relations and a community of shared future for mankind.

In fact, cooperation under anarchy is an age-old conundrum in international relations. For Central Asia, it is especially the case. For geopolitical and historical reasons, the region has been afflicted with political instability, religious strife and ethnic conflict, and often suffered invasion and intervention by outside forces. Thus, effective security cooperation is a top priority for regional countries.

The founding of the SCO is an endeavor in this direction. In order to foster cooperation, the SCO is coalesced around the ""Shanghai Spirit"" that features equality, mutual trust, mutual benefit, consultation, and respect for diversity of civilizations.

What the SCO isn't

From the above, we can see that the SCO is clearly aimed at building a new type of regional security organization, which differs from the outdated models. President Xi made this vision poignant by making veiled rebukes to the Western-centric practices.

He stressed that the SCO is based on ""partnership and dialogue rather than alliance or confrontation."" This philosophy underlying China's foreign policy has proven to be a new route to break out of the security dilemma which is seen as inevitable in Western international relations theories.

He also rejected ""condescending lecturing"" by outsiders and firmly supported countries in exploring development paths and governance models that are compatible with their national conditions.

By quoting the Chinese saying ""Power may win for the time being, but justice will prevail for the long run,"" he criticized the ""position of strength"" proposed by the U.S. as a way of pushing hegemony and bullying around the world.

Besides, President Xi reiterated the SCO's commitment to practicing ""true multilateralism"" and opposed using the so-called ""rules"" to undermine the international order and cause confrontation and division. Instead he urged for the abidance of the United Nations Charter and adherence to the principle of ""consultation, joint contribution and shared benefit."""
1336,Is AUKUS already backfiring on America?,"Editor's note: Andrew Korybko is a Moscow-based American political analyst. The article reflects the author's views and not necessarily those of CGTN.

The leaders of Australia, the UK, and the U.S. announced a new trilateral military alliance on September 15 – called AUKUS – which will facilitate the sharing of technological information between them. This will include cooperation on artificial intelligence (AI), cyber issues, long-range strike capabilities, quantum computing, and underwater systems. Although not openly stated, their leaders made it obvious that it's meant to ""contain"" China in the Asia-Pacific as part of their latest act of unprovoked aggression against it in the new Cold War.

As the saying goes, ""the best-laid plans of mice and men often go awry,"" and AUKUS is already backfiring on America. Far from acting as a catalyst for uniting its allies against China, this alliance is actually exacerbating differences among them. The clearest evidence of this is French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian's condemnation of the initiative's flagship project to have the UK and the U.S. help Australia obtain a fleet of nuclear-powered submarines.

The continent-sized country will abandon its prior AUS$90 billion ($66 billion) deal with Paris on these vessels that were plagued with problems over the past few years. The minister said that ""This is really a stab in the back. We have established a relationship of trust with Australia. This trust has been undermined. And today I am angry over the termination of this contract."" His sharp remarks came despite U.S. President Joe Biden praising France's role in what his country and its allies have recently taken to calling the ""Indo-Pacific.""

According to the American leader, ""France, in particular, already has a substantial Indo-Pacific presence and is a key partner and ally in strengthening the security and prosperity of the region. The United States looks forward to working closely with France and other key countries as we go forward."" While it's true that France is a player in this region due to the lasting legacy of its colonial-era possessions there, Washington's smooth words weren't enough to placate Paris after it just lost out on what its media referred to as the ""Contract of the Century."""
1337,The Election Committee polls: A new beginning for Hong Kong,"Editor's note: Zhu Zheng is an assistant professor focusing on constitutional law and politics at China University of Political Science and Law. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

The 2021 Hong Kong Election Committee will be chosen on September 19. This will be the first election in the city under the new rules coined by the National People's Congress (NPC) and its Standing Committee that will directly impact the ensuing two pivotal elections: the Legislative Council election on December 19 this year and the Chief Executive election on March 27 next year.

According to the newly revised Annexes I and II to the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), the new Election Committee (EC) will be composed of 1,500 members, who must be Hong Kong permanent residents. Besides, under the Improving Electoral System (Consolidated Amendments) Ordinance 2021, which was introduced by the Government of the HKSAR and came into effect on May 31, 2021, the EC will be responsible for nominating candidates for the Chief Executive and Legislative Council elections.

After years of stagnation, turmoil and unrest, Hong Kong eventually makes peace with itself. The territory's future will hinge upon the upcoming elections, which will decide who governs Hong Kong in the years to come, and without doubt, will also be a far cry from previous polls for the following two reasons.

First, the positions are only reserved for competent ""patriots,"" Under the new principle of ""patriots governing Hong Kong,"" those unpatriotic Legislative Council candidates will be weeded out and ""pawns of anti-China forces"" will be knocked out once and for all, according to Wang Chen, vice chairman of the NPC, when he explained the improvement of the electoral system.

Indeed, the enlarged Election Committee comprising five sectors and 23 subsectors has been filled uncontested with 1,084 members, leaving only 364 seats open for competition among 412 candidates. And compared with Election Committee polls held in 2016, there will be fewer seats and a reduced electorate, resulting in lower intensity of competition.

Yet it is by no means an unfair election. For one thing, there are still seats open for the opposition parties – as long as they pledge allegiance to the Special Administrative Region and the Basic Law, and do not harm the country and the region. For another thing, competence is still required in the contest and no seats are reserved for self-styled patriots of questionable competence."

He is the founder of AK Consultancy and former chairman of the International Affairs Committee at Bow Group, the oldest conservative think tank in the UK. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

It is hard to imagine the level of anger and humiliation of President Emanuel Macron when he received a letter from Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Wednesday morning announcing the decision to cancel a $40 billion contract agreed in 2016 to buy 12 of France's Naval Group conventional submarines in favor of nuclear-powered submarines built with U.S. technology.

You then try to reach the U.S. administration to ask what is going on, and you are being given some explanation only three hours before you see U.S. President Joe Biden, along with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison and UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, on a TV screen announcing a new U.S.-led security alliance (known as AUKUS) between the three countries that would concentrate on their joint Indo-Pacific strategy.

Indeed, you have every right to feel betrayed as, without any doubt, that feels like ""a stab in the back,"" which should not take place ""between allies,"" let alone long-term friends. It just makes you realize that although Donald Trump left the office, his ""America First"" code of conduct seems to be still in use.

""The American choice to exclude a European ally and partner such as France from a structuring partnership with Australia, at a time when we are facing unprecedented challenges in the Indo-Pacific region, whether in terms of our values or in terms of respect for multilateralism based on the rule of law, shows a lack of coherence that France can only note and regret,"" we could read in a joint statement released by French Foreign Minister Jean-yves Le Drian and Armed Forces Minister Florence Parly.

The statement called France ""the only European nation present in the Indo-Pacific with nearly two million citizens and more than 7,000 military personnel,"" and affirmed that the country is a ""reliable partner that will continue to fulfill its commitments, as it has always done.""

Despite all of your good intentions, the ""trop c'est trop"" moment slowly kicks in, and you decide to cancel an upcoming reception at the French Embassy in Washington D.C. that had been planned to mark the 240th anniversary of the Battle of Capes, in which your countrymen stood by Americans' side in their fight for independence from the British Crown – which is itself highly symbolic."

Editor's note: Hamzah Rifaat Hussain, former visiting fellow at the Stimson Center in Washington and former assistant researcher at the Islamabad Policy Research Institute, is a TV anchor at Indus News in Pakistan. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN. It is now an established fact that the U.S.-led war in Afghanistan was a massive strategic blunder which has brought nothing but destitution, insecurity and a crippling economy for the average Afghan citizen. That being said, the Pentagon has now acknowledged that the drone strike on August 29 aimed at the Islamic State, was a tragic mistake as it killed 10 civilians including seven children. This admission reaffirms the fact that America's drone legacy is brazenly toxic with civilian lives constituting collateral damage in counter terrorism operations. This is simply unpardonable in Afghanistan and beyond.

The death of Zemari Ahmadi who was a driver and longtime worker for an American aid group, is a stark reminder that Afghan civilians have continued to bear the brunt of gross miscalculations within their own territories given that Ahmadi had nothing to do with ISIS. As per General Kenneth F. Mckenzie Jr. the Commander of the U.S. Central Command, the strike against Ahmadi was carried out based on a ""profound belief"" and not absolute certainty that a correct target would be struck, which was later corroborated by a New York Times investigation. U.S. history is replete with such controversial tactics, as this attack is eerily similar to previous gross miscalculations of terrorist targets in countries such as Pakistan and Yemen over the years, where a spike in civilian casualties has resulted in pervasive anti-American sentiment taking hold. It also contributed towards, the unmitigated potency of terrorist organizations. The divisive drone legacy of the U.S. in Afghanistan, is however linked to broader failures constituting the entire modus operandi of the war on terror. Assessments from America's own think tanks such as the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) document how unmanned combat aerial vehicles (UCAVs) were solely responsible for civilian deaths in Afghanistan, Iraq and Pakistan despite the ratio to militant casualties being considerably smaller.

Editor's note: Li Juan is a researcher and lecturer at the Human Rights Institute of Southwest University of Political Science and Law. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

On September 14, the 48th session of the United Nations (UN) Human Rights Council held a dialogue with the High Commissioner for Human Rights. Jiang Duan, the minister of the Chinese mission to the UN in Geneva made a joint speech on behalf of a group of countries, pointing out that the United States and its allies had been fighting Afghanistan for 20 years and the U.S.-led military intervention in Afghanistan is the root cause of the humanitarian disaster in Afghanistan.

The joint statement called on the High Commissioner for Human Rights to continue to pay attention to the serious negative impact of military intervention by these countries on the human rights of the Afghan people, and to hold their soldiers accountable for crimes such as killing Afghan civilians.

The series of U.S. military operations in Afghanistan have indeed caused serious human rights violations and severely violated international humanitarian law.

Firstly, the U.S. airstrikes in Afghanistan caused a large number of civilian casualties. On August 29, 2021, the U.S. military launched an air raid and destroyed a residential house in Kabul, killing a family of 10, including seven children. The youngest was only two years old. On October 3, 2015, the medical charity ""Doctors Without Borders"" was attacked by U.S. airstrike in Kunduz, killing 19 people, 12 medical staff, seven patients including three children. The laws of war permit attacks only against military objectives, civilians are immune from attack. Attacks that target civilians, that are indiscriminate, or that cause disproportionate civilian loss are unlawful.

Secondly, there are a lot of abuses of prisoners. In 2016, the U.S. Department of Defense was forced to publish hundreds of photos of prisoners abused by U.S. troops stationed in Afghanistan. In 2020, the chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court stated that there is evidence that nearly 100 Afghan prisoners were tortured, abused and even raped during the interrogation.

It is quite ironic that the U.S. initially took military intervention in Afghanistan to fight terrorism and solve the human rights issues of the Afghan people, but it brought disaster to Afghanistan. But this result is not unexpected.

First, on the balance between protecting human rights and U.S. national interests, the U.S. always chooses the latter. Therefore, in military operations in Afghanistan, the U.S. put its national interests above the right to life of Afghan civilians, which also reflects the double standards adopted by the U.S. government."
1341,Exclusive with Ahmad Wali Massoud on Taliban Rule,"Although the Taliban say Panjshir Valley is now under their control, the Afghanistan resistance movement recently released a photograph of Northern Alliance leader Ahmad Massoud from Panjshir Valley. He called on the Western countries to support anti-Taliban forces in an audio message. Tian Wei got a chance to talk exclusively with Ahmad Wali Massoud, the brother of the late elder Panjshir resistance leader, Ahmad Shah Massoud. Wali Massoud served as the former Afghan ambassador to the United Kingdom, and chairs the Massoud Foundation. He told CGTN that his nephew is safe and rejected reports of intensive fighting in the Panjshir valley. Despite the roads being blocked in the mountainous area, resistance fighters are not giving up."
1342,Exclusive with Ahmad Wali Massoud on Humanitarian Situation,"The United Nations convenes an international aid conference in Geneva to help shore up much-needed aid for Afghanistan on Sep. 13. The UN called for more than $600 million in emergency funds to help tide over vulnerable Afghans facing famine and violence. After the Taliban announced the caretaker government last week, the top UN envoy to Afghanistan did appeal for uninterrupted aid to ease the dire humanitarian situation. Food and jobs are harder to come by for many Afghans, forcing millions to seek refuge within and outside the nation's borders. For its part, China has pledged some 31 million dollars -- that's 200 million yuan -- worth of grain, winter supplies and vaccines to Afghanistan. Neighboring Pakistan has sent oil and other supplies to Kabul while Russia plans to ship food and medicine. What more can the international community do to help Afghanistan? Could the UN call for more aid be answered?"

Editor's note: William Jones is a Washington policy analyst and a Non-resident Fellow of the Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

Did anyone imagine that the British Empire was a thing of the past? The latest moves by the Biden administration clearly indicate that it has been reincarnated under U.S. leadership and that the old ""gunboat diplomacy"" which in the 19th century was led by Her Royal Majesty Victoria is now being led by an American President. President John Quincy Adams warned long ago that the United States should never become ""a cockboat in the wake of a British man-of-war"".

Little did he imagine that the British - and now their Australian subjects - would become a ""cockboat in the wake of an American man-of-war."" The Brits are not taking this amiss, of course, since this allows Great Britain to become ""Global Britain"", again.

And the Aussies, ecstatic over the invitation to join the U.S.-British ""special relationship"" for all their talk of being independent, have always prided themselves on being part of that great mother, the British Commonwealth. And dreams of empire have never died in old Albion.

President Biden is also flaunting Adams' other advice about not going out and ""seeking monsters to destroy."" The ""monster"" in this case is the People's Republic of China, and while Biden is probably not intent on destroying it, he is intent on forcing China to kowtow to the rule of the ""Anglo-American Order.""

This is done under the pretext of preserving the post-World War II order, but this is all a hoax. The post-war order envisioned by Franklin Roosevelt was definitely not envisioned as an Anglo-American, or even a Western-dominated order.

Roosevelt made clear to Churchill that in the post-war world, he would not adopt Churchill's ""18th century methods."" There would be new nations brought into the world community like China and India, with very different cultures than in the West, and, yes, the Soviet Union would be an integral part of this order. This is the post-war world order that China and Russia are in fact defending. But with the death of Roosevelt, Churchill made a comeback, as did his 18th century methods."
1344,What COVID-19 revealed about hunger,"Editor's note: Brittany Kesselman is a postdoctoral research fellow at the Society, Work and Politics Institute at the University of Witwatersrand in South Africa. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

In South Africa, many people struggle to access sufficient quantities of healthy food. Because their diets are high in processed foods, refined starch, sugar and fat, they face a double burden of malnutrition and obesity, or what is known as ""hidden hunger."" It is hidden because it does not fit the stereotypical image of hunger created by media coverage of famines. But it is everywhere.

To be clear, the problem is not a shortage of food. In South Africa, hunger is a result of lack of access. Getting enough calories and adequate nutrients is largely tied to income. Beyond the high cost of healthy food, hidden hunger in the country reflects the limited availability of nutritious products in low-income areas, the cost of energy for cooking and food storage and lack of access to land for household food production.

The COVID-19 pandemic and the strict measures imposed to contain its spread brought hidden hunger out of hiding, as many people who had been able to afford just enough food to survive suddenly found themselves going without. According to one study, 47 percent of households ran out of money to buy food during the early stages of the initial lockdown in April 2020. Job losses, a crackdown on informal vendors and price increases caused by interruptions in global food and agriculture supply chains all contributed to a sharp rise in food insecurity. Images of long lines for emergency food assistance brought the issue into public view. Increased levels of child hunger in particular were worrying, but unsurprising, given the abrupt closure of schools and school-based nutrition programs.

The pandemic also made the consequences of hidden hunger more apparent. Because adequate nutrition is necessary for a healthy immune system, food-insecure individuals are more likely to become ill. Additionally, there is a correlation between the severity of COVID-19 and diabetes, a disease associated with poor diets. Data from Cape Town suggest that COVID-19 patients with diabetes were almost four times more likely to be hospitalized and over three times more likely to die from COVID-19 than patients without diabetes.

But while COVID-19 increased food insecurity and highlighted the consequences of hunger, it also produced potential solutions for increasing access to affordable, healthy food. In the face of disruptions to global supply chains, more localized food systems began to emerge. Where the government failed to implement adequate measures to offset the economic repercussions of lockdowns or the closure of school nutrition programs, civil-society groups sought to fill the void. Across South Africa, community action networks sprang up to address hunger, with volunteers providing meals and other assistance to fellow community members."
1345,SCO contribution to stability shines amid uncertainty in Afghanistan,"Editor's note: CGTN's First Voice provides instant commentary on breaking stories. The daily column clarifies emerging issues and better defines the news agenda, offering a Chinese perspective on the latest global events.

The chaotic situation created by the irresponsible U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan has rattled its neighbors.

At this uncertain moment the vision of shared regional development, respect for sovereignty and mutual cooperation to fight radicalism and terrorism represented by the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) is more important than ever.

The U.S. actions in Afghanistan are a perfect example of why trying to impose hegemony with force will always fail.

By butting into the internal affairs of Afghanistan, the U.S. actually froze the development of the country for decades.

U.S. officials may have believed they were ""nation building,"" but in fact their attempt to impose a friendly client state at the point of a gun simply ended up created an extended civil war and propping up a bloated and corrupt government that collapsed the moment the U.S. retreated.

Afghanistan understandably is a central concern at this year's SCO meeting. The initial impetus of the organization was, after all, to combat extremism and terrorism in the region and protect the security of all the member states.

Obviously, the fast-evolving situation in Afghanistan is of concern to all members of the organization.

In the spirit of respecting each other's sovereignty, SCO members are taking a circumspect attitude. Adhering to the commitment of not to interfering in the internal affairs of others, many nations including China hope Afghanistan chooses its development path based on its actual conditions – and are ready to help if Kabul asks.

This doesn't just follow ""the golden rule"" of international politics. As we have seen from the U.S. example, meddling always backfires."
1346,Toward a future in space,"Editor's note: Zhang Fan, PhD, is an associate professor of Astronomy at Beijing Normal University, where he serves as deputy director of the Gravitational Wave and Cosmology Laboratory. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

Three Chinese astronauts on the Shenzhou-12 manned spacecraft just landed in northern China, marking a successful conclusion to their three-month mission in space.

During the flight, the astronauts and the ground crew impressed the world with their engineering professionalism and attention to details. Take their spacewalk as an example. During the previous spacewalk mission, the residual air pressure in the airlock made it a little difficult for astronauts to exit and conduct extravehicular activities. But no such thing happened this time.

Their mission was to assemble, test out and verify several key components of the Tianhe (Heavenly Harmony) core module that could serve as the command center for China's future Tiangong (Heavenly Palace) space station, onto which further lab modules Wentian (Questions to the Heavens) and Mengtian (Dreaming of the Heavens) will be docked.

Here, this indicates possibility, since the Tianhe in orbit is only a test module. Its sibling on the ground is ready for further adjustments, should the astronauts detect any potential faults. Once the faults are cleared, the improved module will be launched and become the core of the Tiangong space station.

The Tianhe in orbit is highly likely to become the official core module of the current Tiangong space station, while the backup will dock with it in orbit and serve as the core module of the expanded space station later.

Interestingly, the modular design of the station means further cores can be connected to previous ones, and with every core module carrying two additional lab modules on both sides, a long centipede-like space station can be formed."

Editor's note: M. Alam Brohi is a former member of the foreign service of Pakistan who retired after serving seven years as Ambassador to the Kyrgyz Republic and the Islamic Republic of Sudan. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily those of CGTN.

The U.S. is devising policies to contain the political, economic and strategic ascendancy of China. It seems this containment will be the central plank of U.S. foreign and security policy in the coming years. This competition and confrontation between the two countries, though short of a new Cold War, will keep many regional states on tenterhooks. The U.S. government is trapped domestically and internationally in their China-obsessed politics stemming from their weakening capacity to oversee world matters.

The reckless U.S. involvement in military excursions in far-off lands since World War II has resulted in countless deaths and spending of dollars. It has also left these places in utter humiliation and damaged its image of a dependable world leader. Direct U.S. military interventions and proxy wars in regions ranging from Latin America to Africa, and the Middle East to Southeast Asia, have left bitter legacies including political anarchy, intractable hostilities, militancy and terrorism.

Meanwhile, over the past four decades, China has been busy strengthening its political, economic and strategic position at the regional and global levels in ways that align with its national blueprint embedded in peace, stability, good neighborliness and economic development.

However, the economic and military rise of a regional state, in political and strategic terms, is deemed a threat to the world hegemon. This is how the U.S. government perceives China.

China has concentrated on realizing its economic potential, putting its political, ideological and territorial issues with other countries on the backburner and adopting a policy of patience and restraint in international affairs. This policy stemmed from the late Chinese statesman Deng Xiaoping's economic reforms starting in 1978 and continuing with more liberal economic plans under successive leaders. Within a decade or so, the world started witnessing the dividends of this focused economic development. China became the second largest economy by nominal GDP in 2010, and already overtook the U.S. in terms of purchasing power parity in 2020.

Following its economic development, China has become the top trading partner of East Asian countries and signed regional economic deals that include free trade agreements with Australia, Singapore, South Korea, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and others. China's trade with Africa and Latin America also leapfrogged, the former of which grew from only around $10 billion in 2000 to $220 billion in 2014. Between 2000 and 2014, Chinese financing to Africa peaked at $122 billion, dwarfing the U.S. amount of $106.7 billion.

The past few years have witnessed China building institutional infrastructure to share its affluence with other countries. In 2014, China, in collaboration with other BRICS countries, created the $100 billion New Development Bank, and the following year, set up the $100 billion Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, which 103 countries have since joined."

His primary research interests are China's international relations and ""socialism with Chinese characteristics."" The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

Even though it never slacked on this obligation in the past, China has been promoting the multilateralism diplomacy even more this year.

The imperative of this objective has became more urgent since the world got confronted with the daunting challenge of surmounting the coronavirus.

The COVID-19 onslaught came at the peak of the U.S. Trumpian days of insular and isolationist diplomacy. Former U.S. President Donald Trump persuaded a German pharmaceutical company to produce new COVID-19 vaccines only for use by the U.S. And this was just one of the many examples of his isolationist diplomacy.

On the contrary, China, the second largest economy in the world, has followed a different path that encompasses and takes the whole world along in the fight against the pandemic.

The latest move in the second week of September was the start of construction on a COVID-19 vaccine plant in Serbia, the first in Europe, turning the tide and moving the project faster to ensuring that the world truly and quickly heals from the menace.

The foundation stone laying for the factory in Belgrade further showed China's determination to aid the world with COVID-19 vaccines and make it easier for countries to better and faster achieve herd immunity.

Prior to this, China concluded in May plans for similar cooperation with Egypt, Brazil, Mexico, Turkey, Pakistan, Indonesia and the UAE. That is a global reach on all the continents with the exception of Oceania.

There exists a sure-footed diplomatic move that wears a human face, unlike the deterministic approach of some powerful countries who find it difficult to carry along the rest of the world.

The approach makes China stand out as exceptional among countries that developed vaccines against the pandemic, including India, the U.S and the UK.

At the foundation stone laying event, Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic expressed pride and appreciation that his country in liaison with partners from China and the UAE, was ""trying and seems to be able to solve some global problems.""

From April 2022, when it is meant to come on line, the factory is projected to roll out 30 million doses annually, a volume that is billed to cater to the vaccine needs of several countries in the region with the Chinese-developed Sinopharm vaccine."

Editor's note: Radhika Desai is a professor of political studies at the University of Manitoba in Canada. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

The United Nations, the most inclusive multilateral institution of world governance ever created, where each country has a vote, could not celebrate its 75th anniversary properly last year. It had to do so virtually. Worse, it was also clear that the letter and spirit of its original multilateralism had been deeply compromised.

The United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) recognized that the pandemic, the ecological emergency, the still great need for development, rising waves of desperate migration and many other world problems were crying out for cooperation and multilateralism. It highlighted the theme ""The Future We Want, the UN We Need: Reaffirming our Collective Commitment to Multilateralism.""

However, the U.S. could not care less. Just months before, former U.S. President Donald Trump had ratcheted up Barack Obama's hostile ""pivot to Asia"" into a new Cold War towards China in response to its technological development and reaction to the pandemic. At the UNGA, Trump shrilly repeated allegations about the ""Wuhan Virus"" and the ""Kung Flu"" with no proof.

Many expected President Joe Biden to be different at the 76th General Assembly and underline that ""America is back"" in the multilateral game. They hoped this will consign the cantankerous Trump years to the proverbial dustbin of history and inaugurate a new age of multilateral cooperation at the UN.

However, while history may have a dustbin for superficial contingencies, there is none for deeper developments. It is their working that explains why, on the most important matters, whether it is China or foreign policy, economic policy or even pandemic policy, President Biden, though elected to be the anti-Trump president, has found it hard to move out the ruts the Trump administration had made.

The ""America is back"" show had hardly opened when it crashed on the shoals of the Alaska Summit, the continuing trade, technology and military belligerence against China, the slowing vaccination drive and the slowing recovery threatened by the potential of Federal Reserve interest rate increases. Will Biden's address to the 76th General Assembly be different? Will it be credible if it does?

It would indeed be very surprising if it did. The pattern of U.S. foreign policy of unilateralism and exceptionalism is even more deeply entrenched in U.S. history from its beginnings than the other aspects of the much-maligned Trump policies that Biden has followed."
1351,A positive momentum in China-Singapore ties,"Editor's note: Bobby Naderi is a London-based journalist, guest contributor in print, radio and television, and documentary filmmaker. The article reflects the author's opinions, and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

It is now a telling yarn that the United States is more than willing to divide and rule Southeast Asian nations as part of its strategy to counter China.

The Biden administration recently deployed Vice President Kamala Harris and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin to Southeast Asia to do just that. Both officials visited Singapore and delivered hawkish speeches seeking allies in the region against Beijing.

As is customary, they used the visit to highlight their self-defined success and role in preserving the rules-based world order and treaties, ways to face down China and to undercut the roles of others through short-termism and closure.

The only problem is that Singapore does not seem interested in taking sides between the two powers - just like many other nations in the strategic region. To substantiate, on September 14, when Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong met with Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi, he vowed to continue to work with Beijing, touting the cooperative relationship between the two neighbors.

In a Facebook post, Lee wrote, ""Singapore welcomes China's continued contribution in our part of the world, and will continue working with China to build a more harmonious and peaceful world.""

In a sense, Singapore, like many other nations, is determined to continue working with China to build a more harmonious and peaceful region for everyone. These nations don't trust or see the U.S. as a trustworthy partner. In their eyes, the U.S. is hyper-focused on Southeast Asia and the Indo-Pacific region as a region for influence, not as a region that needs peace and cooperation. No, the U.S. is not fixated on environmental protection, maritime sovereignty, and safety either.

Not surprisingly, the entire spectacle has been tiresome and unproductive for the U.S. as a consequence. On the other hand, Lee Hsien Loong and other officials from the region have been lauded for their courage and effort to highlight China's ongoing success in preserving the rules-based international order, regional treaties and agreements, as well as ways to face down the U.S. and its go-it-alone approach and short-termism through multilateralism and regional cooperation.

With the weakening of the economy and pillars on which so much of America's paramount power rested, China and Singapore have a lot to gain from each other. This includes advancing cooperation with China on Singapore's government projects and exploring new areas of cooperation such as the digital economy and infrastructure."
1352,"Frequently pushing on Taiwan, Biden devoid of a strategy","Editor's note: Alessandro Golombiewski Teixeira is a national thousand talent distinguished professor of public policy at the School of Public Policy and Management, Tsinghua University, and a professor of international business at Schwarzman College in Tsinghua. He is a former special economic advisor to the president of Brazil and former Brazilian minister of tourism, and minister of development, industry and foreign trade. He was also president of the World Investment Association – WAIPA. The article reflects the author's views, not necessarily those of CGTN.

Under the ""one-China policy,"" the United States severed diplomatic relations with Taiwan and recognized it as a part of the People's Republic of China. Nevertheless, the U.S. government has always used the Taiwan issue from time to time to carry out anti-China activities and to contain China's rise.

The Biden administration has frequently pushed on Taiwan to provoke China this year, demonstrating its own presence and confirming its hegemonic status. In fact, such actions on the Taiwan issue make U.S. President Joe Biden look like ""the poor donkey at its wit's end"" in the Chinese fable.

The recent event connected with Lithuania is a good example. On September 13, U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan spoke with Lithuanian Prime Minister Ingrida Šimonytė by phone and declared his firm support for Lithuania's response to ""coercive behavior"" from China.

The White House issued a statement saying that Sullivan discussed strengthening economic, diplomatic and defense cooperation between the two countries during his call with Šimonytė. Sullivan is the third senior U.S. official to publicly ""back"" Lithuania, all claiming to stand with Lithuania against ""Chinese coercion.""

On the outside wall of Vilnius City Hall, the capital of Lithuania, there is a quote from former U.S. President George W. Bush Jr., saying, ""Anyone who would choose Lithuania as an enemy has also made an enemy of the United States of America."" Due to complex historical and political factors, Lithuania, a former Soviet state, has been following a ""pro-American"" line, insisting on anti-Russia and going further and further down the road of anti-China. However, Lithuania's own serious socio-economic problems have not been solved but have a tendency to worsen.

Egidijus Meilūnas, Lithuanian Deputy Foreign Minister, whose work includes economic and diplomatic affairs, called on the U.S. to expand access to the U.S. market for Lithuanian products, and Lithuania looks forward to providing new investment opportunities for the U.S. side.

However, regardless of the current ability of the United States to help Lithuania prosper economically, the United States will not be willing to provide any substantial help to Lithuania. After all, for the United States, Lithuania is just an insignificant political pawn. Although Lithuania's submission to the U.S. has attracted its attention in the short term, the U.S. government will still focus on the Indo-Pacific region, trying to stabilize Russia to strengthen strategic competition with China."
1353,"U.S. academics show a spine, support their Chinese colleagues","Editor's note: Anthony Moretti is an associate professor in the Department of Communication and Organizational Leadership of Robert Morris University. The article reflects the author's views and not necessarily those of CGTN.

Now and then, the right thing happens, even if a bit too late. One such example took place a few days ago when a group of U.S. professors at Stanford University made a demand of the Joe Biden administration: End the terribly unfair and perhaps even illegal targeting of Chinese scholars working in the United States.

The disgraced Donald Trump administration launched the program called the ""China Initiative"" in 2018. The Department of Justice defended the initiative, stating it was a ""strategic priority of countering Chinese national security threats and reinforces the president's overall national security strategy.""

That was nonsense then. It remains nonsense now.

If there were one word to describe Donald Trump's opinion of China during his presidency, it would be envy. Trump could not tolerate the rapid advancements China was making on the global stage; in his warped view of the world, America came first, last and everywhere in between on the greatness scale. No country - especially one from Asia - was going to threaten that.

Therefore, and like so many ideas that sprung from his mind, the initiative was intentionally hostile to China, and more specifically its scholars. Keep in mind that many of these researchers are involved in complex, multi-year projects in the United States that will eventually have benefits for more than just one country.

Sadly, Trump could not understand that, and he took advantage of the notable anti-China hysteria existing in Congress and throughout the United States in pushing his agenda. Few people spoke out against the ""China Initiative,"" and those voices were drowned out by the political elite often working hand in glove with select anti-China news organizations.

Put another way, when Chinese researchers and professors working in the United States became one of Trump's favorite targets, voices of dissent were not regularly heard in mainstream media discourse. (Chinese students in the U.S. also were swept up in Trump's illogical thinking.)

Trump was convinced these scholars had sought to work at U.S. colleges and universities simply because they wanted to steal the ideas, plans or creations of their American colleagues.

Quickly, the administration sought to arrest and charge these Chinese scholars with a host of trumped-up accusations.

One high-profile case is now over, and Trump most certainly would not approve of how it ended."

Editor's note: Stephen Ndegwa is a Nairobi-based communication expert, lecturer-scholar at the United States International University-Africa, author and international affairs columnist. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

One of the worst outcomes arising from the coordinated September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in the United States by al-Qaeda was the further polarization of a world that was eventually healing from the Cold War. Not to lose such an opportunity, the U.S. played the Biblical Moses on Mount Sinai, dividing the world between those who supported it in the war on terror on the one hand and those who were against it on the other. There was no neutral ground.

The emerging dichotomy was epitomized by then U.S. President George W. Bush in his State of the Union address on January 29, 2002, when he coined the phrase ""axis of evil"" to describe countries that allegedly sponsored terrorism. These included isolating Iran, Iraq and DPRK as common enemies of the U.S.

Recently, the U.S. has escalated its war against China by crystallizing the so-called Quad alliance. Mooted as the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue following the devastating 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, which claimed an estimated 230,000 lives and billions of dollars in damages, the four-country informal grouping comprises the U.S., Japan, India and Australia.

At the invitation of U.S. President Joe Biden on Monday, an in-person summit of this Indo-Pacific anti-China brotherhood will take place at the White House on September 24, the second after the first meeting in March was held virtually amid coronavirus concerns. The timing of the meeting is rather mischievous, taking place alongside the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) in New York, which also started on Monday.

Of course, this is not a coincidence. Biden could be trying to legitimize his Quad baby to UNGA members. But it will be a hard sell for its obvious malicious, if not diabolical, agenda. The group is inimical to the interests of the global community due to its potential for inciting a geopolitical crisis that can revive the long-forgotten Cold War mentality.

To give impetus to the inimical Quad alliance, on September 15, Biden unveiled another front against China comprising Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States (AUKUS). According to the U.S., the tripartite group was formed, like Quad, ""to deepen diplomatic, security, and defense cooperation in the Indo-Pacific region,"" which is a euphemism for countering China's influence in the area.

The White House statement spells out a variety of interventions against China in the region ranging from military and trade to science and technology. Shockingly, the U.S. talks about arming Australia with nuclear-powered submarines, which leaves little to the imagination about what the U.S. sees as a confrontation with China in the region."

Editor's note: The U.S. invasion of Afghanistan 20 years ago has cast a shadow on the country. While it has now withdrawn from the country, the pain and chaos it had caused have not faded away. This is just one of the many examples of the damages the American war machine has inflicted upon other countries.To gain a deeper understanding of the situation, CGTN compiled a list of viewpoints from our commentators. The article reflects the authors' opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

The U.S. has caused tragedies in many countries with its usual way of warmongering under the guise of ""defending democracy."" These wars resulted in numerous deaths and relentless chaos in local society. The environmental cost of the wars is also an element to be reckoned with. While wreaking havoc across the globe, the military-industrial complex in America has profited enormously from the war industry, which speaks volumes about the U.S.'s hypocrisy.

Chaos and tragedies in Afghanistan

Although the U.S. tried to whitewash its crimes in Afghanistan, its quick and irresponsible withdrawal tells another story.

""The West is fully responsible for what happened, both directly in terms of the chaos that followed its ongoing irresponsible withdrawal from Afghanistan, as well as indirectly due to what it did to foster the rise of ISIL in the first place,"" said Andrew Korybko, a Moscow-based American political analyst.

Bobby Naderi, a London-based journalist, guest contributor in print, radio and television and documentary filmmaker, gives a whole picture of the tragedy.

""Thanks to America's chest-beating jingoism, millions are still displaced throughout the volatile region, with many forced to cross the Mediterranean Sea, the cemetery of refugees, in search of safety in Europe. Countless Afghans, Syrians and victims in other countries, who have to walk for months and sleep rough on station platforms or along a roadside, are still tear-gassed and beaten at borders or crammed into trains and lorries to make their way to Europe.”

With all the pain America has inflicted on Afghanistan, will it start to reflect on its behavior and put a lock on Pandora's box in the future? It seems not. According to Anthony Moretti, associate professor at Robert Morris University, ""One bitter reality remains for the Iraqis and Afghans: No U.S. president or military leader will be prosecuted for the staggering death toll they are responsible for in those countries.”

What's more, Washington is implementing an embargo against talking over the tragedy, and its media is complying with the order. With limited access to foreign media, the unfounded rumors on social media and the embargo within their own country, the American people will become less aware of the tragedies Afghanistan has suffered."
1356,COVID-19 and poverty: Will the world ever recover?,"The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has plagued the global economy with unprecedented challenges. The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted socioeconomic activities around the world; this abrupt change has had a pernicious footprint on supply chains, public health, jobs, food systems and several other related sectors worldwide. While millions of lives have been lost, many jobs have also been decimated, mainly because a large proportion of businesses, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) have been exposed to existential threat, which has thrust millions of people into poverty. The current alteration of the global economy is devastating, as the COVID-19 pandemic is effectively wiping out many years of progress attained in the fight against poverty.

Editor's note: Alexander Ayertey Odonkor is an economic consultant, chartered financial analyst and chartered economist with an in-depth understanding of the economic landscape of countries in Asia and Africa. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

A recent World Bank report (2020) indicates that extreme poverty, which had been declining steadily for close to 25 years, exhibited a regressing trend for the first time in 2020; more than 100 million people were estimated to fall into extreme poverty in 2020 alone while an additional 23 million to 35 million are expected to be pushed into poverty by the end of 2021, bringing the potential tally of new people living in extreme poverty to 150 million.

Even though through concerted efforts from governments, development organizations and relevant stakeholders, extreme poverty, which is one of the targets of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs), has been dwindling for almost a quarter of a century, the disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic is exacerbating the impact of climate change and armed conflict, which are the two major factors that are constraining efforts to alleviate global poverty.

Furthermore, while newly collected data suggest that the already-poor households and vulnerable people are suffering the most from COVID-19-related job losses and deprivation around the globe, the pandemic is also altering the demographic profile of global poverty by creating millions of a new type of poor people. While this new group of poor people is mostly located in urban areas, they are better educated and less likely to work in the agriculture sector as compared to the people who were living in poverty before the outbreak of COVID-19; this group of new poor are more likely to work in the informal sector.

Taking specific policy measures to lift the already-poor and the new group of poor people from extreme poverty will be a step in the right direction to reverse the retrogressing trend of global poverty. However, providing a panacea to COVID-19 alone in an effort to eliminate extreme poverty will not suffice. The most sustainable solution is to rely on a twin-track approach that focuses distinctively on addressing the pandemic and conflict in the short-term alongside pursuing long-term climate-resilient development goals.

Practically, implementing this two-track model effectively could be daunting. However, it is the surest way to bolster inclusive economic growth and promote shared prosperity, which is vital in the fight against poverty. To effectively ameliorate extreme poverty, it is imperative for policymakers and relevant stakeholders around the world, specifically those in developing countries, to draw lessons from countries that have been successful in carrying out this approach.

This modus operandi is not to discourage evidence-based policymaking in developing countries and promote copy and paste policymaking but rather it should be seen as a window of opportunity to gain additional insight that could augment domestic efforts to design and implement programs that will provide long-lasting solution to COVID-19, climate change and conflict, which will eventually alleviate poverty. While there are not many countries to learn from in this area, China's performance in recent times has been outstanding.

Undoubtedly, China's impressive accomplishment in eradicating extreme poverty should be a key reference point in the twin-track approach for developing countries."
1357,Australia submarine row shows that Europe can't trust the U.S.,"Editor's note: CGTN's First Voice provides instant commentary on breaking stories. The daily column clarifies emerging issues and better defines the news agenda, offering a Chinese perspective on the latest global events.

The leaders of the UK, U.S. and Australia announced a ""technology-sharing deal"" on Wednesday that would see the three countries come together on research and development to counter China. The most publicized part of the deal was that the United States would now share its nuclear submarine technology with Australia, leading Canberra to jettison a $90 billion order it had placed with France.

This provoked outrage from Paris, which said the betrayal ""only reinforces the need to make the issue of European strategic autonomy loud and clear"" – in other words, to be less dependent upon the United States as a partner.

France, and by extension Europe, cannot trust the United States as an ally or partner. ""America First"" was not a phase under Trump but a permanent orientation of American foreign policy whereby it has been happy to undermine, cheat and betray its partners in the pursuit of its zero-sum rendering of self-interest.

Despite Biden having frequently marketed ""America is Back!"" and pushed a charm offensive against Europe, the U.S. hastily threw France under the bus as soon as it saw the opportunity to deepen profits for its own military-industrial complex.

It was falsely assumed that with the demise of Donald Trump, the United States' self-interested approach toward Europe would come to an end and that ties would be ""renewed."" As the narrative focused so much on Trump for who he is, as opposed to American foreign policy as a general rule, European leaders placed far too much hope on Biden being different. They bought into his shoddy claims that he would support allies under the name of ""America is Back!"" and restored transatlantic solidarity.

The U.S. readily bullies Europe and has little tolerance when the bloc's interests differ from Washington's."

The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN. In a blow to established norms of non-proliferation, U.S. President Joe Biden announced a new working group with America's traditional allies – the United Kingdom and Australia – termed the ""allies agreement"" entailing the acquisition of nuclear-powered submarines for greater coordination in the Indo-Pacific region. Given the importance placed on de-escalation and denuclearization globally, with disproportionate attention paid to Iran's nuclear program despite its recent compliance with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), this latest agreement presents a dim reality that is not conducive to unconditional demilitarization in the region but provocative and escalatory.

While all parties to the agreement initially refrained from propping up the ""China threat"" perception, according to two American officials, the contextual framework underpinning the agreement is yet another attempt to contain China. It encompasses the trio or ""AUKUS,"" ensuring the ease of sharing information on subjects, such as artificial intelligence, long-range missiles and probable cyberattacks, which is complemented with the provision of nuclear-powered submarines. Deemed surprising by American officials, this foreign policy pivot from the Biden administration is considered an exception to America's own proclaimed standards, as it squarely targets Indo-Pacific defense priorities. With Australia, it is perhaps even more surprising. Its geographical proximity to China has meant that Canberra's decision to abandon an initial $66 billion submarine deal with France for a nuclear one from the United States is paradoxical. Note that unlike the UK or the U.S., Australia has never found it necessary to acquire nuclear weapons given the lack of palpable security threats it has encountered in the region, which both President Joe Biden and Prime Minister Scott Morrison have admitted. For the Biden administration officials pursuing Australia, it is worth remembering that in 2010, both Canberra and Washington, D.C. signed the ""123 agreement,"" which involved a promise that enrichment or reprocessing nuclear material will not be pursued. However, under the new allies' agreement in 2021, nuclear submarines are now part and parcel of the equation, which essentially equates to the Indo-Pacific nuclearization.

As an Egyptian observer, I have been studying about China for the past year – its government, society, history and transformation – and have talked with hundreds of Chinese and China-haters for the past three months. I have seen the great achievements of China, together with the hate and fear of some Western politicians.

China's story since the 1980s has been one of an almost divine metamorphosis. The country has ended extreme poverty, taken the lead in the world's 5G network rollout, launched three astronauts to its new space station core module, landed its Zhurong rover on Mars …

China is developing. Is it a problem?

Some Western countries hate and fear the rapid development of a country that once was weak. They can't believe their 400-year-old global supremacy is being challenged. That's why, although the United States has killed millions of people and screwed several regions in the past 30 years, your television, newspapers, Google news feed and social media are all 24/7 condemning China, which has not sanctioned any country or overthrown any foreign government. None of the accusations made by Western politicians and media are backed up by evidence."

Editor's note: Adriel Kasonta is a London-based foreign affairs analyst and commentator. He is the founder of AK Consultancy and former chairman of the International Affairs Committee at Bow Group, the oldest conservative think tank in the UK. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN. On September 13, the United Nations (UN) hosted a donor conference held in Geneva to press the international community to join hands in helping to meet Afghans' most basic needs and prevent a mass exodus from the war-torn country.

Seeking to secure $606 million in humanitarian aid for approximately 11 million people in the last four months of 2021, the UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who hosted a high-level ministerial meeting, said in his opening remarks that after decades of war and suffering, ""The people of Afghanistan need a lifeline"" during ""their most perilous hour."" Guterres also said many people in the country could run out of food by the end of September and praised the UN Humanitarian Air Service's airbridge from Pakistan's capital Islamabad to the Afghan cities of Kandahar, Mazar and Herat, concluding that ""this work must continue."" Peter Maurer, the president of the International Committee of the Red Cross, told the audience that ""primary healthcare is on the brink of collapse, water services failing and food prices exorbitant"" after recently visiting Afghanistan and seeing the situation with his own eyes. It is said that about a third of the donated money would be transferred to the UN World Food Programme (WFP), which estimates that 93 percent of the 1,600 Afghans it surveyed between August and September were not getting enough to eat. Speaking at the same event, WFP Executive Director David Beasley said 40 percent of Afghanistan's wheat crop had been lost, the cost of cooking oil had doubled, and most citizens do not have access to cash to buy food. ""Fourteen million people, one out of three, are marching to the brink of starvation. They don't know where their next meal is,"" Beasley said. He also warned that ""if we are not very careful, we could truly, truly enter into the abyss in catastrophic conditions, worse than what we see now.""

1361,The SCO in limelight after Western retreat from Afghanistan,"Editor's note: Yuan Sha is an assistant research fellow in the department of American studies at the China Institute of International Studies. A former Fulbright scholar at Columbia University, she has a PhD in International Politics from China Foreign Affairs University. Yuan has published several papers on China-U.S. security relations in Chinese academic journals and regularly contributes to many Chinese media outlets. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

The 21st Meeting of the Council of Heads of State of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) is to be held this week in Dushanbe, Tajikistan. Given the heightened security risks in the aftermath of the U.S.-led withdrawal from Afghanistan, this meeting is much-anticipated to take on the responsibility of bringing stability and prosperity to the region.

SCO at 20

This year marks the 20 years anniversary of the September 11 terrorist attacks and the American-led war in Afghanistan. It also marks the 20 years anniversary of the founding of the SCO. The two developments were separate but correlated, which were both the result of the rising terrorist threats in the post-Cold War era.

In the hinterland of the Eurasian mass, Central Asia has long acted as the bridge between East and West where different ethnicities, religions and cultures meet and create splendid civilization. It was also the critical route along the Ancient Silk Road where trade prospered and cultural exchanges were vibrant. Due to geopolitical reasons, the region has also been haunted with the ""three evils"" of separatism, extremism and terrorism.

The SCO was founded in June 2001 on the very goal of cooperation on security matters in the region. Over the past two decades, the organization has evolved into an influential regional security forum with eight member countries including China, Russia, Tajikistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Pakistan and India, which covers 60 percent of the Eurasian continent and boasts 40 percent of the world population and 20 percent of the global GDP.

As a new type of regional partnership, the SCO is different from the confrontational-style alliances of the Western bloc. Instead, it is premised on political dialogue and consensus building for the purpose of collectively responding to common security challenges in the region. Although members harbor different interests and concerns, they share the common goal of maintaining stability and prosperity in the region. The joining of India and Pakistan as full members of SCO in 2017 and countries in the wider Central Asia and Middle East as observers and partners is an exemplar of this inclusive endeavor."
1362,"Global Britain should profit from, not fear, China's rise","Editor's note: CGTN's First Voice provides instant commentary on breaking stories. The daily column clarifies emerging issues and better defines the news agenda, offering a Chinese perspective on the latest global events.

The new Chinese ambassador to the UK, Zheng Zeguang, has been barred from British Parliament, in an unprecedented breach of decorum.

How did relations between the UK and China sink so low that Parliament would go out of its way to gratuitously insult China's ambassador? It's worth reviewing how this vicious circle got started, who it benefits and who it harms.

Britain says its actions are in retaliation to China's sanctions on British members of Parliament.

This ignores the fact that Britain itself started this unfortunate tit-for-tat chain reaction when it joined a group of Western nations in imposing sanctions on Chinese officials in March over an alleged genocide. The March sanctions were intended to demonstrate that the world would rally together to get ""tough"" on China.

It's interesting to note that the initial ruckus about ""genocide"" in Xinjiang ahead of these sanctions has quieted, with few politicians choosing to use that word anymore.

This is because – very similar to the hypothesis that COVID-19 started from a lab leak in Wuhan – there is not one shred of credible evidence.

In 2021, it is quite remarkable to allege genocide could occur without any proof other than eyewitnesses provided by a group actively fighting to break Xinjiang away from China. There have been no satellite photos, mobile phone videos or any concrete evidence whatsoever of ""genocide.""

The accusation of genocide in Xinjiang is quite similar to charges that China was harvesting organs from members of a religious cult – horrifying but with no evidence and no basis in fact. The organ harvesting accusations are another favorite smear of certain anti-China parliamentarians in the UK."
1363,Rewilding and regenerating: Safeguarding the Loess Plateau ecoregion,"Editor's note: Wu Changhua is the executive director of the Professional Association for China's Environment. The article reflects the author's opinions, and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

Halting and reversing the decline of nature and enhancing climate resilience have become both an opportunity and an obligation of the Loess Plateau ecoregion in China. It also offers a living case of transition of a traditionally coal-dependent region towards a future that is people and planet positive.

Chinese President Xi Jinping's recent visit to northwestern Shaanxi Province has further highlighted the significance and the level of priority the central government assigns to driving such a transition.

Just like its name, the Loess Plateau in Chinese reflects the distinct color and landscape of a critical ecoregion in both China and Central Asia. Wind and soil, rivers and mountains, and seasonal changes, all the ecosystems' goods and services nurtured the birth and prosperity of an ancient agrarian civilization.

Such prosperity has undergone ups and downs in history, but remains and grows stronger today. Sitting at the northwest of the Yellow River Basin, it forms a transition zone between the maritime-influenced ecoregions of eastern China and the steppes and deserts of Mongolia. According to the World Wildlife Fund, the Loess soils are rich in minerals that are essential for plants, and they retain water quite well, so the region is well situated for agriculture.

While the Loess feeds a growing population and enriches diversity of both nature and culture, history has documented its rising ecological costs and escalating degeneration of nature. When most natural forest there were converted to farmlands and pastures centuries ago, a decline by a factor of eight occurred during the last three millennia. When forests were cleared, soil erosion shot up quickly. With vegetation being denuded, the soils degraded and contributed to dust storms.

Then came the industrial revolution. The Loess Plateau is geologically rich in coal and also easy to mine. The biggest reserve and producer of high-quality coal in China, the region hosts half of China's large-scale coal mines. As a consequence, the Loess has gained its reputation not only as the ""grain basket"" but also the ""boiler"" of China. Open coal mining aside, pollution of air, water and soil further wreaks havoc to an already ecologically vulnerable region.

Now, climate change adds a ""Code Red"" alarm globally. The Loess suffers with no exception. More frequent, intensified flash flooding and droughts crash the region. The infrastructure born from both industrialization and urbanization proves weak resilience. This summer's flash flooding took hundreds of lives and crippled transportation systems and the industrial supply chain.

While bearing the heavy losses and costs, the region is taking on its obligation and opportunity to transition and contribute to an urgently needed clean energy and ecological transformation. Such a transition is defined by three interconnected and mutually reinforcing legs – rewilding local ecosystems, scaling down coal and upping cleaner production, and enhancing resilience."
1364,Taking on China over Taiwan is Biden's biggest blunder yet,"Secretary of State Antony Blinken's testimony before Congress that his country ""will do whatever it takes"" to ""support Taiwan against China"" is nothing less than saber-rattling. This brinkmanship is even more bellicose when considering that he supposedly misspoke by describing the island as a ""country."" It might not have been accidental though since it's quite possible that America's top diplomat intended to send a hostile message to China.

Taking on China over Taiwan, though, is definitely Biden's biggest blunder yet and one which will doom his presidency if he doesn't soon reverse this policy. The report that his administration is considering renaming the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office (TECRO) to the ""Taiwan Representative Office"" blatantly infringes on China's territorial integrity by implying de facto U.S. government recognition of the renegade island as a separate political entity from the Chinese mainland of which it's historically been an inextricable part.

U.S. President Joe Biden's administration has been a disaster. He has failed to contain COVID-19, political polarization seems to have reached unprecedented heights due to his coercive vaccination policy that many Americans regard as infringing on their constitutional rights, the economy's supposed recovery is mostly superficial, and the U.S. just withdrew from Afghanistan in disgrace after losing control of the country to the Taliban. All this happened in only eight months.

The media is now talking more about the latest unexpected downturn in Chinese-American relations brought about by Washington's own hand than any of the other crises that the Biden administration is responsible for, which might have been the whole point all along. This political distraction is extremely dangerous though since China regards all threats to its territorial integrity as very serious matters. Symbolism such as that represented by the reported TECRO scandal and signals like Blinken's statement are part and parcel of diplomacy.

There is no ""plausible deniability"" or ""strategic ambiguity"" for the U.S. to fall back upon now. It's obvious what's going on. Biden wrongly thinks that he can bully China, not only as a convenient distraction from his cascading domestic crises, but also due to his discredited belief in America's superiority over all its peers. One would have thought that this former superpower would have been humbled by the Taliban, but instead it's now picking a fight with a country many orders of magnitude more powerful than that insurgent group.

No realistic scenario exists wherein the U.S. comes out of this brinkmanship unscathed if it does indeed go through with renaming TECRO. The potential consequences of making this kind of wrong moves would make the first eight months of Biden's disastrous presidency look mild by comparison to put it diplomatically.

There's never been a more urgent time in history for the U.S. to look inward and resolve its growing socioeconomic and political contradictions which threaten to spiral out of control if they aren't addressed as soon as possible. America's humiliating defeat by the Taliban in Afghanistan shows that it's incapable of and shouldn't be participating in what it regards as ""great power competition"" with China.

Taking on China over Taiwan isn't just Biden's biggest blunder yet, but also his most dangerous. He's guaranteed to fail, which will only make his country's many other crises much worse. The American leader is also risking global stability through his irresponsible brinkmanship over an issue halfway across the world that isn't of any objectively legitimate relevance to the U.S. national interests. Biden must realize that it's counterproductive to threaten China just to distract from domestic crises. Hopefully he wises up and doesn't have to learn a lesson.

In a small room at the back of a supermarket selling products and specialties from Yizhou, a district under the administration of Hechi City, south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, the CGTN Digital team found the young and lively Huang Haixia talking to online audiences as she presented a local rice brand. The 33-year-old, who goes by the name of ""Sanjie"" on the video platform Douyin, is a professional livestreamer giving demonstrations of products sold in the supermarket with the aim of increasing the income of impoverished farmers in the region. The epidemic has undoubtedly affected business, and livestreaming has managed to keep everyone afloat. Livestream shopping is hardly new in China, but it has exploded since the outbreak of COVID-19. A recent report by the China Internet Network Information Center indicates that as of June, China had 309 million e-commerce livestreaming users, up 16.7 percent from March. The industry has over 400,000 active livestreamers, with over 10 million livestreaming marketing activities in the first half of this year attracting over 50 billion views.

Authentic experience for targeted audiences When the CGTN team visited, Huang was wearing a traditional Liu Sanjie costume that is common on live transmissions as a way to put an extra spotlight on local characteristics. ""This is the internet era, so if we are promoting these products in Douyin and we are in the hometown of Liu Sanjie, singing and wearing these traditional costumes is a must, that's why I'm wearing this beautiful costume today. We must show Yizhou characteristics,"" she shared proudly. We caught her during the second half of her shift which starts in the morning with onsite shoots, followed by studio livestreams in the evening. ""Right now, we don't have fresh fruits, but if we had, we would go to the orchards to livestream from there. When people see it directly, they want to help the farmers, and this project is exactly for that, to help farmers sell their products,"" she explained.

""Because people go to work and school during the day, there may not be many people watching during daytime, so we broadcast in the evenings, after 5 or 6 p.m. If it is an indoor live, it will take about three or four hours. This is a fixed time, otherwise, we will lose viewers."" Huang said that each session features five or six products, with around half an hour dedicated to each. The feedback has been mostly positive. ""For sure, not all 100 percent praise, but it's mainly good.…"" she said. ""Some customers have been seeing us for a while, and they may say, 'you are always introducing the same thing;' that's not very good.""

Trade secrets There are a few essential ingredients for success in this trade. First, presenters need to have a comprehensive understanding of the products they sell. ""We need to have a real understanding of the product characteristics; if we don't, we need to go into the field to learn. Like silkworm breeding, it's very important for us, so we need to know about it."" The more they know, the more information they can give viewers, improving the quality of the experience. Second, favorable feedback from the clients themselves online and during live sessions can be very helpful in driving sales. ""For example, with beef jerky, someone said they bought it last time and it was good, and then someone says 'I'll buy it too,'"" Huang said. ""This is very common because these snacks come in small bags that are easy to share with others. If other people buy it, it will be easy to repurchase."" She admits there is a big difference between livestreams like hers and mainstream shopping channels on Chinese social media and e-commerce platforms.

1546,Scenery along the 'sky road': A trip aboard the Qinghai-Tibet train,"For centuries, Tibet has not been explored as much by the outside world due to its remote location, extreme climate and geographic environment. Since the initial launch of the Qinghai-Tibet Railway in 2006, this railway has become the most popular and convenient way to connect Tibet to the rest of China, bringing tremendous profits to the regions. Dubbed the ""sky road"" and noted as a man-made wonder in transportation, the 1,956-kilometer-long world-renowned railway begins in Xining and ends in Lhasa. The stunning scenery along the railway offers not only a feast for the eyes, but also a journey for the soul. Come join CGTN to enjoy the enchanting trip on the Qinghai-Tibet train!

Qinghai Lake: A paradise for birdwatchers and cyclists

Starting from Xining Railway Station, it takes around one hour to appreciate the stunning view of Qinghai Lake. Dazzling like a crystal-clear gem, Qinghai Lake is the largest inland lake as well as saline lake in China. Surrounded by lofty mountains, the lake features two sub-lakes: a saline Gahai Lake and a freshwater Erhai Lake. Be it the blue sky and water, the green grassland or mesmerizing landscapes – Qinghai Lake boasts great charms worth exploring.

Qinghai Lake is definitely a paradise for bird lovers as many different kinds of birds would fly here to breed in May and June due to the mild weather. Meanwhile, for cyclists, cycling around the lake not only allows them to enjoy the beauty of the lake view, but also while away the time.

Tips:

The best time to visit the Qinghai Lake is from April to August as numerous Cole flowers blossom along the lake during that time, forming breathtaking scenery for visitors. In addition, May and June are the best season for bird watching.

Kunlun Mountains: More than just mountains

As the train keeps moving up, a picturesque view of the Kunlun Mountains appears before you. Reputed as the holy mountains, the Kunlun extend west from the Pamirs with a length of 2,500 kilometers. The 6,178-meter-high Yuzhu Peak is the highest of the Kunlun Mountains in Qinghai. The high peaks are covered with snow and mist all year round, creating a stunning view along the Qinghai-Tibet Railway.

It's worth mentioning that Yuzhu Peak is the first sightseeing station for passengers, which allows them to get off the train and take photos outside. It is considered to be an ideal choice for hiking beginners as its route requires less technique.

Hoh Xil Nature Reserve: 'Forbidden zone for humans'

Hoh Xil, which means ""green mountains"" in Mongolian, is a plateau between the Kunlun and Tanggula mountain ranges, with an average altitude of 5,000 meters. Home to many wild animals, including the Tibetan antelope and the wild yak, Hoh Xil Nature Reserve is undoubtedly a desolate region in the northwestern part of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in China.

The extensive area of alpine mountains and steppe systems is situated more than 4,500 meters above sea level, where sub-zero average temperatures prevail all year round. The geographic and harsh climatic conditions have made this place a ""forbidden zone for humans,"" which is also a reason for its biodiversity. This is probably one of the few places left on Earth where one could get off the beaten track and find inner peace.

Tips:

As there are no signs in Hoh Xil Nature Reserve, visitors often get lost here. Remember to bring a local guide with you or rent a car to travel.

Tsonag Lake: A 'soul lake' for Tibetans

Lying in Amdo County, Nagqu Prefecture in the Tibet Autonomous Region, Tsonag Lake is one of the most significant holy lakes to local residents. The Qinghai-Tibet railway passes right by the lake, making it the closest altiplano lake to the railway on the road. Passengers can take photos and capture the charming view of the lake as they would definitely have something to brag about on social media.

Lhasa: The start of the journey to Tibet

The final destination of the Qinghai-Tibet train trip – Lhasa, offers almost every aspect of Tibetan culture. If one must pick a name card for Lhasa, the Potala Palace is very likely to be the answer. No one can really say that he/she has visited Lhasa unless they have been to the Potala Palace – a must-see for travelers from home and abroad.

1547,The ULTIMATE Chinese Food Tour: Fiery Palace stinky tofu in Changsha,"04:47

Inside the red walls of Changsha's Fiery Palace in central China's Hunan Province is one of the unique dishes I've ever tasted or seen made – stinky tofu. The dish dates back to the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) when a local woman began frying discarded tofu in tea oil and stumbled upon a dish that would become a pillar of Hunan's thriving street food culture.

Zhou Houmu, the fourth-generation inheritor of the craft of making Fiery Palace stinky tofu, keeps the tradition near and dear. I met him in the kitchen of the dining area, frying the signature dish. But before dipping the tofu squares into the hot oil, I had to witness the previous steps firsthand. The brine that is used to give the tofu its smell and taste is composed of 20 ingredients, which are mixed and left to ferment for at least a year and a half before use. After that, the concoction can be used over and over again, regularly mixing old and new. According to Zhou, the oldest brine held at the Fiery Palace is 10 years old.

The smell in the brine room is intense, as you can see from my reaction in the video. Fresh tofu squares are soaked in the brine for six hours before removal and rinsing, yet much of the color from the jet-black liquid remains. As I reached my arms into the brine to fish the tofu from the bottom, the smell got even more intense. While I struggled, Zhou said he's become so accustomed to it, he actually likes it now. He also warned me that it would take at least six or seven scrubbings and the rest of the day for the smell to disappear from my arms completely. He was telling the truth. Frying, a key process which requires skill to avoid overcooking, gives the soft tofu a crispy outer layer, and the dish is served with chili sauce and other seasonings. The flow of people eager to get their hands on a bowl is a steady one.

If stinky tofu doesn't interest you, the Fiery Palace is brimming with many other Hunan dishes for every palate. I tried at least 10 and left more than satisfied. The food court is an introduction to Hunan cuisine, and the other restaurants on-site provide some of the finest dishes around made by inheritors. When you plan a trip to the Fiery Palace, come ready to learn about the history of Hunan street food culture, and be sure to come hungry."
1548,The ULTIMATE Chinese Food Tour: Tea and pastries in Yangzhou,"04:54

Fuchun Teahouse is tucked away in an alley in Yangzhou City, east China's Jiangsu Province. It's one of those local treasures that's a bit off the beaten path, but has a reputation big enough to keep customers coming in droves. Established in 1885, the teahouse was simply a flower shop until then owner Chen Buyun introduced a variety of pastries. The place hasn't looked back since.

The teahouse was buzzing on the morning we arrived as people of all ages lined up for a coveted seat inside. At 76 years old, Xu Yongzhen, the national-level inheritor of the Fuchun pastry craft, still has pep in her step as she walks through the teahouse's kitchen and courtyard, and can make pastries with an enviable amount of artistry.

In one of the private dining rooms, I got a firsthand glimpse of the master at work. Xu showed me two of the teahouse's famous dishes: San Ding steamed stuffed buns, or baozi, and thousand-layer cake. Diced chicken, pork and bamboo shoots are sealed in dough, with each perfectly pleated 28 times. The result is a hot and addictive palm-sized baozi. If you're craving something sweet, the thousand-layer cake is your best bet. Xu showed me the secret to creating the dozens of flaky layers: fold the dough, fold it again, and again and again, adding plenty of sugar and oil along the way. The result is a subtly sweet treat topped with candied strips of winter melon.

1549,The ULTIMATE Chinese Food Tour: Pixian broad bean paste in Chengdu,"05:07

Stepping inside Chengdu's Sichuan Cuisine Museum is an experience. Filled with manicured gardens and ponds, exhibition halls and restaurants, it's like a theme park for all things Sichuan. This is where I found Zhang Anqiu, the provincial-level inheritor of the ""soul of Sichuan cuisine"" — Pixian broad bean paste. The paste is omnipresent in food here, and without its spicy kick, the true taste of Sichuan would be absent. As the story goes, the creator of the paste, Chen Yixian, moved to Pixian during the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) with beans in tow. The beans molded, and Chen decided to salvage them by drying them in the sun and mixing them with other ingredients. His concoction became a hit and the core of one of China's most popular cuisines. Five simple ingredients are needed: broad beans, chilies, flour, salt and water.

I mirrored Zhang as went through each step of the preparation process, adding each ingredient and mixing them all by hand. He plucked the stem off of each chili with the speed and precision of a machine before washing and chopping them. The final product is fermented in large jars outside on the museum grounds and tended with care by the inheritor, who periodically aerates each one. According to Zhang, some of the paste has been fermenting for as long as 10 years. From fish-flavored shredded pork to mapo tofu, you can taste the finished product in the many food stalls at the museum, which I wasted no time in doing. Only a few miles away, Dandan makes the area's signature condiment on a much larger scale. Stepping inside the facility, you're immediately engulfed in a scent of chilies; it's no doubt the spiciest air I've ever breathed.

A field of large vats holding an estimated 2,000 tons of Pixian broad bean paste fill the massive room. To cover such a large area, the vats are aerated by a small fleet of machines that can handle the volume while keeping the famous paste in peak condition. I was told the paste, still the color of red brick, had been fermenting for around six months at the time of my visit. Impressively, the quality of the broad bean paste is not sacrificed in the scale of the operation. Later, at dinner, while happily filling my stomach with double-cooked pork and kung pao chicken, I could taste the soul of Sichuan in every bite."

1552,Renaissance of Chinese Huangjiu: Good wine does need a bush,"A Huangjiu factory in Shaoxing, east China's Zhejiang Province, May 28, 2021. /CFP A Huangjiu factory in Shaoxing, east China's Zhejiang Province, May 28, 2021. /CFP

A creative ice cream bar made from Chinese Huangjiu, Chinese yellow rice wine, was launched by the Chinese Huangjiu Museum in 2016. Because of low alcoholicity and novel taste, more than 10,000 ice cream bars were sold in the first month of the launch. The ice cream bar can be seen everywhere in Shaoxing, a city famous for Huangjiu in eastern China. Other inventive recipes followed and gained popularity as well. For example, a local restaurant in Shaoxing innovated a pudding with Huangjiu two years ago. On average, about 60 puddings can be sold per day, a considerable quantity for the restaurant.

Pudding with Huangjiu. /Zang He Pudding with Huangjiu. /Zang He

The Huangjiu ice cream bar is the first among the dessert series. Its creator Ruan Shuai, deputy director of the marketing department of the Chinese Huangjiu Museum, was inspired by the ice cream bar of Palace Museum in the shape of representative cultural relics. Inspired by the popularity of the Palace Museum ice cream bar, an idea flashed into Ruan Shuai's mind to add Huangjiu to the ice cream bar. He said this new ice cream bar was not created to earn profit but to let more people know about Chinese Huangjiu and its culture. ""I consider this new kind of ice cream bar as a popular way to spread the culture of Chinese Huangjiu.""

Huangjiu is one of the world's oldest alcoholic drinks, along with beer and wine. The origin of Huangjiu dates back to the Hemudu period (about 5500 to 3300 B.C.). There are many assumptions about the origin. One of them says it might be invented by accident. Back then, the primitives hollowed out the mulberry tree to store leftover rice. Sometimes they forgot the rice and left it in the hollow for a long time. When they took it out, the rice was fermented into a mellow and sweet food, the Huangjiu. Now the commonest alcohol in China is Baijiu, a kind of distilled-liquor rather than fermented. But it was Huangjiu that had accompanied the Chinese people for the longest time. About 3,000 years ago, Chinese people began to make Huangjiu in large quantities. Now it is commonly associated with daily cooking.

The three oldest alcoholic drinks in the world are Chinese Huangjiu, beer, and wine. /Zang He The three oldest alcoholic drinks in the world are Chinese Huangjiu, beer, and wine. /Zang He

In recent decades, the market shares of Huangjiu lag far behind its historical significance. According to statistics released by the China Alcoholic Drinks Association in April 2021, the revenue of Huangjiu in 2020 only accounts for 16.1 percent of the total revenue of alcoholic drinks in China. According to the Report on the Status and Development of Chinese Huangjiu Industry (2021-2027) released by China Industry Research Network, there is a regional imbalance in the consumption of Huangjiu with the sales in three eastern coastal regions (Jiangsu Province, Zhejiang Province and Shanghai) accounting for more than 70 percent of the total amount in China. Huangjiu has been innovated in some other ways. Many people consider Huangjiu as a low-alcohol drink. In fact, the alcoholicity of Huangjiu is 4 to 5 times more than that of beer. Besides, Huangjiu contains fusel and acetaldehyde, which make people get drunk easily. Gu Yue Long Shan, a Huangjiu company in Shaoxing, and Jiangnan University jointly established a laboratory to innovate Huangjiu. After more than three years of research, the laboratory launched a new product that reduces the amount of content in the product that makes consumers tipsy.

Despite its rapid industrialization, there are still some corners in China that have maintained its original color.

Ancient towns and villages in China are places where traditions are well preserved in terms of architecture, lifestyle, folk customs and craft.

The new series ""Ancient Charm of China"" intends to give you a glimpse of China's rustic local charms.

Our first episode introduces one of the most beautiful old towns in China.

Nestled in Zhaoping County in Hezhou City, south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, Huangyao Ancient Town is 200 kilometers from Guilin – one of the most-visited tourist spots in Guangxi. It is said that the town was named after two common surnames back then – Huang and Yao.

Covering an area of 3.6 square kilometers, Huangyao boasts typical karst landscapes and abundant water resources. Streams and rivers mark the territory around the old town like a serpent.

Huangyao has a history of nearly 1,000 years with its origins dating back to the Song Dynasty (960-1279). It reached its prime in the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) under the reign of Emperor Qianlong (1733-1735).

For this reason, there are many buildings from the Qing and Ming eras that remain unchanged in their architectural styles today. Now it is home to approximately 300 folk houses, 20 temples and ancestral halls, and 10 pavilions and opera stages.

Traditional festivals and customs have been carried on for hundreds of years. During Chinese Lunar New Year, over 20 traditional performances are held, including the dragon dance, lion dance and suona horn (Chinese trumpet) show.

On July 14 in the Chinese lunar calendar, local residents often come to the riverbank and put pomelo lanterns into the river to celebrate the Hungry Ghost Festival, or Zhongyuan Jie in Chinese.

Huangyao tofu is a must-try local dish when you visit, as it is exclusively made and sold in Huangyao. Also, fermented black soybean is often added to its local specialties to create a distinctive flavor.

It usually takes a day or two to tour around the old town due to its small size. But you can always linger longer to experience more of its local hospitality and culture.

The admission fee is 100 yuan (14.5 U.S. dollars), and valid identification is needed to buy the ticket.

Though the cave is now much eroded by water, visitors are still amazed by how big the cave was to hold thousands of people back then. Another hot spot is Xizhou bronze pillars erected on the lower reaches of Mengdong River. The 2,500-kilogram pillars witnessed the agreement of ceasefire between two states of Chu and Xizhou in history. The original pieces corroded long time ago.

The volcano has spewed out thousands of tonnes of lava, destroyed hundreds of houses and forced the evacuation of nearly 6,000 people since it began erupting last Sunday. La Palma, with a population of over 83,000, is one of an archipelago making up the Canary Islands in the Atlantic.

Spanish airport operator Aena said the island's airport had closed. Workers swept volcanic ash off the runway, electronic boards showed cancelled flights and the departures hall was quiet as some people arriving at the airport discovered they would not be able to fly out.

People evacuated from three more towns on Friday will not be able to return to their homes to retrieve their belongings because of the ""evolution of the volcanic emergency,"" local authorities said. ""Volcanic surveillance measurements carried out since the beginning of the eruption recorded the highest-energy activity so far during Friday afternoon,"" emergency services said. At the quiet port of Tazacorte, fishermen described the devastating effect the eruption has had on their livelihoods. ""We haven't been out fishing in a week, the area is closed,"" said Jose Nicolas San Luis Perez, 49, who lost his house in the eruption.

South African Airways (SAA) is set to return to the skies on September 23, but the airline has expressed concern, indicating that it might be an uphill task to get stakeholders, including the passengers, to regain trust in the carrier.

The national carrier will resume flights after 16 months of being grounded due to viability challenges, despite repeated government bailouts and implementation of business rescue plan.

The operational failure of the SAA has allegedly been caused by corruption, and the inescapable impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Resumption of flights comes three months after the government ceded part of its airline stake to Takatso Consortium, who are now the majority shareholders with a 51 percent stake.

The airline's interim chief executive officer Thomas Kgokolo said that winning back the stakeholders' trust would ""take time.""

However, he expressed great optimism in the airline's team's ability to turn things around, saying that ""with the confidence and the enthusiasm our staff are showing ahead of our take off, I'm confident we will achieve the set goals quickly.""

1572,Working abroad after COVID-19: What has changed?,"Travel restrictions and border closures have not stopped people from going overseas for work, and the rise of technology has enabled new trends that are most welcomed in wealthy Western countries, the latest survey on expatriates' experiences shows.

Despite coronavirus-related disruptions to international travel, more than half of those residing in a foreign country or considering a cross-border move in the past year said the pandemic has not directly impacted their current stays or future plans. This is according to the 2021 survey conducted by InterNations, a Munich-based global network for expats with more than four million members.

Who are the globetrotters?

Citing this year's survey data from 8,313 overseas residents representing more than 160 nationalities and working in 175 destinations worldwide, the organization has found that the group comprises mostly well-educated people, of whom 80 percent are university graduates. Over half hold advanced degrees, while others are white-collar workers in mid- to senior-level positions.

According to InterNations, about a third of the respondents employed overseas earn an annual income ranging from $50,000 to $100,000, with the most common industries being education, IT and finance. Other sectors include manufacturing and engineering, healthcare, advertising, marketing and communications.

What changed during COVID-19?

Many people have had to change their plans during the pandemic, with disruptions to personal travel and social life being the biggest concerns for working expats, said Stephanie Anko-Hubik, the media spokesperson for InterNations.

""Personal concerns clearly outweigh economic or financial ones,"" Anko-Hubik told CGTN. However, she acknowledged that the figures might exclude people who have already moved home or are unemployed due to COVID-19.

About one in five of those who have returned home from a stay abroad said that they returned earlier than originally intended due to reasons related to COVID-19. Over 60 percent of the returnees cited personal reasons, including wanting to be closer to family and social isolation abroad. Meanwhile, 46 percent also planned to return to their life abroad within the year.

The survey also showed that an overwhelming 77 percent of local respondents who had to put their relocation plans on hold at this time said they still want to move abroad within the next two years."

According to locals, the lake water can be blown as far as one kilometer away from the shore on windy days.

At the mouth of Aibi Lake, the Jinghe River enters the lake from the northern slope of the Tianshan Mountain, leaving a footprint like the roots of a giant tree. The red seepweed and green seagrass make the wetland a colorful wildlife paradise."
1574,East China Sea 101: The rare bird with special 'hairstyle' in Fujian,"This March, in the Jian'ou City of southeast China's Fujian Province, bird-watchers spotted a type of bird with a special ""hairstyle"", as the elongated feather on the back of the head looks like large peacock feathers on the headwear of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) officials.

The bird is called Chinese merganser. It is an endangered species on the IUCN Red List and a first-class state protected bird in China. According to experts, this is the first time Chinese mergansers are spotted in the area, marking the region's good environment.

The Chinese merganser is a migratory bird. It breeds in northern forests, and spends winter in southern areas including China, Japan and Thailand. Due to vegetation destruction, water pollution and habitat loss, the population of the bird declined rapidly in the 1960s and 70s.

As it has a high requirement for habitat environment, the bird's presence has become an indication of the ecological excellence of the local environment. Therefore, the news of spotting the birds resting in Jian'ou City excited many experts and birdlovers.

1575,UK allays fears of campaigners seeking postponement of climate summit,"An influential climate alliance has demanded postponement of the UN Global Climate Change Summit (COP 26) in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic to ensure ""safe, inclusive and just"" negotiations.

Climate Action Network (CAN), an umbrella organization of 1,500 civil society groups spread over 130 countries, said a considerable number of developing countries are reeling under vaccine shortages and struggling to contain the transmission of COVID-19.

Under such circumstances, government officials, delegates, activists and campaigners from these countries may find it difficult to attend the summit, said CAN on Tuesday.

""Our concern is that those countries most deeply affected by the climate crisis and those countries suffering from the lack of support by rich nations in providing vaccines will be left out of the talks and conspicuous in their absence at COP 26,"" said Tasneem Essop, CAN's executive director.

Climate and vaccine equity

In partnership with Italy, the UK will host COP 26 – already delayed by over a year – in Glasgow, Scotland, from October 31 to November 12.

But the host country has placed more than 50 countries on the COVID-19 red list, requiring travelers from these countries to undergo a self-paid 10-day quarantine at a government-specified hotel.

The low-income countries face one of the worst impacts of climate crisis despite having low emissions levels. Now, they struggle to procure COVID-19 vaccines, said CAN.

The organization said the ongoing pandemic and access to vaccines have further deepened the injustice faced by these nations. The organization had demanded vaccine equity and protested the UK's failure to support a patent waiver for the vaccine at the G7 Summit in June.

While 57 percent of the European population is fully vaccinated, the African continent has only been able to vaccinate only three percent of its people, said Essop. ""Our fight for climate justice and our efforts to hold those in power accountable cannot be delinked from the root causes that continue to perpetuate such inequality and injustice.""

'COP 26 must go ahead'

With barely two months left for the climate negotiations to kick off, the UK government issued a statement in response to the demand to postpone the annual summit.

""We are working tirelessly with all our partners, including the Scottish Government and the UN, to ensure an inclusive, accessible and safe summit in Glasgow with a comprehensive set of COVID mitigation measures,"" said Alok Sharma, president-designate of COP 26 on Tuesday.

Sharma also assured campaigners that the government will also provide support for quarantine hotel stays for those attendees arriving from red list countries for the summit. The host will also vaccinate accredited delegates, he said.

""The recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report underlines why COP 26 must go ahead this November to allow world leaders to come together and set out decisive commitments to tackle climate change,"" Sharma said."
1576,Magnificent holy mountain embraced by clouds in SW China,"Aba Tibetan and Qiang Autonomous Prefecture in southwest China's Sichuan Province is one of the best places in China to see grand mountains. Lianbaoyeze Holy Mountain in the prefecture is famous in Tibetan culture.

In Tibetan, ""lianbaoyeze"" means dignified jade mountain. According to legend, Lianbaoyeze was the ancient battlefield of King Gesar, the heroic king of the ancient Tibetan kingdom of Ling.

The holy mountain has picturesque peaks and rocks, resembling numerous rock swords pointing to the sky."
1577,East China Sea 101: Vulnerable pink 'elves',"The East China Sea is home to many rare species, including the Chinese white dolphin, which is often referred to as the ""pink elf in the sea"" or the ""giant panda of the sea.""

Chinese white dolphin has pink skin because of overdeveloped blood vessels. It is listed as ""vulnerable"" on the IUCN Red List, as it has been threatened by problems including habitat loss, water pollution and overfishing. In China, the mammal is under first-class state protection, and due to marine protection efforts, it has been spotted more frequently in these years.

Fishermen in Fujian Province, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and Taiwan region honor the dolphin as Goddess Matsu's fish, therefore seeing them playing in water is considered lucky. From 2017, the mammal has been spotted in many parts of Fujian Province, including Quanzhou Bay, Ningde City, Xianmen City and Fuding City. An expert from the Peking University's School of Life Sciences said the Chinese white dolphins are sensitive to water quality, and an increase in their number is reflective of an improvement in marine environment.

Tianti Mountain Grottoes are located in northwest China's Gansu Province and boast a history of 1,600 years. /CFP

The restoration of the feet of a 1,600-year-old stone Buddha in Tianti Mountain Grottoes has been completed.

The Buddha statue of the site's No.13 grotto in northwest China's Gansu Province was built on fragile red sandstone beside a reservoir. Years of water seepage and weathering damaged parts of the statue, including the feet.

The restoration project was launched in May 2020 by Dunhuang Academy, a national research institute established to protect the renowned UNESCO world heritage site of the Mogao Caves.

The most difficult part to repair was the feet, which had suffered severe water damage, Qiao Hai from the Dunhuang Academy said.

Workers drained water from the floor and rocks surrounding the stone Buddha, removed loose rock chunks, figured out the original size and features of the badly damaged feet, and brought it back to its former glory, according to Qiao.

The project can help protect the foundation of the historic statue and restore its overall integrity, Qiao said.

Some of China's oldest, the Tianti Mountain Grottoes are often referred to as the ""ancestor of grottoes"" in the Chinese academic world. The grottoes were first built in the Eastern Jin Dynasty (317-420) and are under state-level protection."

The United Arab Emirates (UAE) announced it will resume issuing visas to all fully vaccinated tourists from August 30, a month before Dubai hosts the delayed Expo 2020 trade fair.

The move comes amid a drop in COVID-19 cases in the oil-rich Gulf country, after it reported less than 1,000 cases per day last week for the first time in months.

According to a statement by UAE's National Authority for Emergency, Crisis and Disaster Management and the Federal Authority for Identity and Citizenship, the decision to open up visit visa applications for fully vaccinated tourists was ""in line with the UAE's strategy to strike a balance between the interests of public health and sustainable economic recovery.""

Those eligible would have to be fully inoculated with one of the COVID-19 vaccines approved by the World Health Organization, which include AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson, Moderna, Pfizer-BioNTech, Sinopharm and Sinovac.

1586,Vibrant Xinjiang: The desert vineyards of Turpan,"04:28

The city of Turpan in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region is also known by its Chinese nickname ""Huo Zhou,"" literally meaning ""a place as hot as fire,"" due to its reputation as the hottest city of China. The city is home to the fabled Flaming Mountains – the barren red sandstone hills in the Tianshan Mountain range – where the summer temperatures frequently reach 50° Celsius and above. Surrounded by the Taklamakan Desert, Turpan is located about 150 kilometers southeast of Urumqi in a mountain basin, on the northern side of the Turpan Depression, that lies some 150 meters below sea level. The unique geographic and climatic conditions are perhaps the main reasons why Turpan has emerged as China's largest grape growing area and gradually making its way to becoming a key wine-producing hub. The lush green orchards and vineyards, enclosed within a rugged and arid desert terrain, are a sight to cherish. With Tianshan Mountains as the backdrop, the foreground of Turpan Basin is dotted with ""chunches,"" the Uygur word for the compact buildings where grapes are dried and made raisins. During a recent visit to the Grape Valley in Turpan, a team from CGTN Digital got a peek into Turpan's centuries-old vineyards and wine-making industry that have lately become a big draw for both domestic and international travelers. A 2,300-year-old wine history It is believed that Chinese official and diplomat by the name of Zhang Qian from the 2nd century BC was on a mission to the western regions, when he discovered that people in Turpan grew grapes and produced wine. ""We have been brewing wine in Turpan for at least 2,300 years. Presently, there are 67 large and small wineries in Turpan. Loulan Winery is quite famous and has an annual production worth over 100 million yuan,"" Zhang Mingming, deputy general manager of Xinjiang Cultural Tourism Company, Turpan Branch, told CGTN Digital.

The grapes from Turpan are relatively richer in sugar and therefore suitable for making sweet wine. While August is the main harvest season for grapes here, the early-ripening varieties of the fruit mature at the end of June and a few varieties grown in greenhouses mature even earlier, around March. ""However, the grapes used to make wine mature relatively late, usually from the end of September to October. We use a very ancient and primitive method to make wine,"" Zhang elucidated. Turpan grows over a dozen types of grapes, and the water needed to nourish the grape vines is brought via an ancient irrigation system called ""karez,"" meaning ""well"" in the Uygur language. BRI brings new opportunities With Xinjiang being developed as the gateway to China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), Turpan has witnessed transformative growth in recent years. It now takes less than an hour to cover the 150-kilometer distance between Turpan and capital Urumqi via the Lanzhou-Xinjiang High-Speed Railway that opened in 2014, connecting Xinjiang to neighboring Gansu Province. Zhang felt that the BRI brings new opportunities for the development of Turpan's wine industry. ""Turpan was an important township on the ancient Silk Road, an important node, our good wines can be sold abroad through the Belt and Road Initiative. At the same time, the advanced wine-making skills from abroad can be shared in Turpan as well."" Ethnic groups in wine industry Xinjiang is home to scores of diverse ethnic groups and according to the official the wine industry creates opportunities for all communities. ""Local ethnic groups are very open to making and selling wine. They are involved in the whole process of making and selling wine, and even as end consumers,"" Zhang said. He however conceded that ""while some people from the older generation of Muslims may have certain reservations about wine, the younger generation do not have such taboos. ""The younger generation, such as those born in 80s, 90s and 2000s, are very open. And these young consumers are from the Hui, Uygur and other local ethnic minorities. Wine tasting at Western Wine Castle

02:17

CGTN reporters were also offered wine tasting at the Western Wine Castle, which started operation in 2000 from a location inside the Grape Valley. It essentially produces home-brewed wines. ""Our wine cellar is dug inside the Flaming Mountains. It is the only one in the country to be located at such a place. Here we mainly produce whole-juice wine,"" Zhang said. Gulhasal Sattar, the lovely Uygur bartender, served from the wine collection that has developed its own reputation among the regular visitors. ""We produce three kinds of wines: whole juice (sweet red) wine, dry red wine and dry white wine, as well as some grape juice ... The most important feature of Turpan wine is its high sugar content. In particular, the quality of dry red wine is very high. Our root series is especially good because the vineyard is considered to be very pure,"" the official said. ""Our winery sells about 10,000 bottles of wine a year. Our winery currently employs 22 people in the scenic area,"" he informed. While the Western Wine Castle caters to domestic and international tourists arriving at Turpan's Grape Valley, it is still exploring the potential of exporting wines. Tourists can try our wine collection especially at our night bar, but we haven't yet exported to foreign wineries,"" Zhang said. ""The price for our wine ranges from 60 to 300 yuan per bottle,"" he added. Aided by the BRI vision, the wines from the desert vineyards of Turpan are slowly and gradually making inroads into the international market. However, for now, to get the most authentic feel, one needs to travel to China's hottest city to taste the ""coolest"" local wine.

1587,Ruins of ancient Shu civilization excavated in China's Chengdu,"Chinese archaeologists have discovered ruins dating back to the Western Zhou Dynasty (1046-771 BC) and the Spring and Autumn Period (770-476 BC) in southwestern China.



The ruins site in Chengdu, capital of southwest China's Sichuan Province, was discovered during the refurbishment of a primary school, the Sichuan Provincial Cultural Relics and Archeology Research Institute said on Wednesday.



Over 80 tombs, 10 building sites and more than 60 ash pits from the Western Zhou Dynasty and the Spring and Autumn Period have been unearthed, with a large number of bronzes, jades and pieces of pottery among the artifacts, including willow-shaped swords and seals.



The cemetery was arranged in an orderly manner, indicating the site was carefully planned, the institute said.



The discovery is regarded as of great significance for the study of Shu funeral and etiquette systems on the Chengdu Plain.

The ruins site could be traced back to the transition from the early Shu culture represented by the Sanxingdui and Jinsha sites to later times. It provides important materials for archaeologists to explore the ancient Shu civilization, according to Xiong Qiaoqiao, director of the excavation site."
1588,Genting Dream – Hong Kong's first 'cruise to nowhere',"China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) has launched its first ever ""cruise to nowhere.""



The Genting Dream will sail out to sea past the Lei Yue Mun and Tathong channels before entering international waters and returning along the same route.



Each voyage will take 3 to 4 days, but unlike other typical cruise trips, this ship won't stop at any ports of call. That's just one of many health measures it's taken to keep any coronavirus outbreaks at bay.



All passengers and crew must be fully vaccinated and tested for the virus before departure.



Face masks are also required at all times on board the ship, aside from dining and water sports.



The cruise has further implemented its own contact tracing system, requiring passengers to carry a tracking device wherever they go. Anyone within 1.5 meters of an infected person for over 15 minutes counts is a close contact, so the device encourages social distancing.

And while cruises traditionally rely on mixing fresh air with recirculated air for indoor ventilation, rooms on the Genting Dream, including cabins, each have independent ventilation systems that provide 100 percent fresh air.



For example, for cabins, incoming fresh air gets filtered into the room from one vent and gets redirected out of the ship, through another vent in the bathroom, to avoid air recirculation between cabins.



This ship has always had this ventilation system, but other cruises have been working on improving theirs, following last year's spreader events on such ships as the Diamond Princess.



And in keeping with government regulations, the Genting Dream is now operating at half passenger capacity.

The Genting Dream's waterslide park offers six slides with different levels of ""difficulty."" /CGTN The Genting Dream's waterslide park offers six slides with different levels of ""difficulty."" /CGTN

""We spent a lot of effort on hygiene and sanitization. Of course, that costs more labor,"" said Christine Li, senior vice president and head of marketing at Dream Cruises. ""Now on this cruise, we have 1,100 crew, and we also have 1,500 passengers today, so it's almost 1 to 1. It used to be, I think, 1 to 2, so we increased the crew number.""



Meanwhile, isolated wards in the medical center and cabins can also be converted into quarantine rooms in case someone gets infected with the coronavirus.



""I'm not scared of the virus. I've been vaccinated and tested. If I still get infected, I can only say I'm unlucky. But I believe the government has done quite a good job on this so I trust the government,"" said one passenger.



With 19 decks and weighing over 150,000 tonnes, the Genting Dream has a wide range of outdoor attractions to offer, including a ropes course that has a 35-meter zipline. Other activities include rock climbing, outdoor yoga, and a waterslide park with six different slides. Otherwise, retail therapy is available for those looking to splurge, and there are 20 restaurants and bars for others to have their fill.



People were generally excited to be on board. One female passenger said she was looking forward to relaxing with her family and friends, while another guest expressed happiness over being able to travel again.

""Actually, for the summer holiday, [it] has been a robust month for us. The traditional low season is after school holiday[s] – it's September and October, but we see a very good pickup in the low season as well,"" said Li, the passenger.



Li added that the cruise is looking forward to a wider variety of itineraries, especially involving south China's Greater Bay Area, when borders open up.



Cruises in the HKSAR have been suspended since last February, and Genting Cruise Lines is currently the only operator of such a voyage.



The SAR government says this ""cruise to nowhere"" is a good start for the city's struggling tourism sector and a step toward normalcy."

1590,Saihanba: The 'green miracle' created by three generations in N China,"On August 24, 2021, Chinese President Xi Jinping inspected Saihanba Forest Farm in north China's Hebei Province. Saihanba is considered to be a miracle as it has been transformed from barren land to lush forest through the extraordinary efforts of three generations of Chinese people.

President Xi Jinping inspects Saihanba Forest Farm in north China's Hebei Province. /Screenshot from CCTV News President Xi Jinping inspects Saihanba Forest Farm in north China's Hebei Province. /Screenshot from CCTV News

Saihanba was previously been home to abundant forest resources and high biodiversity 400 years ago. With a cool summer and lush vegetation, the area was set to be a royal retreat. However, deforestation and constant wars turned the area into a desert by the end of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911). As the forest barrier was gone, sandstorms became more frequent. To stop sandstorms that kept threatening or event striking Beijing, Tianjin and other northern China cities, the Forestry Administration decided in 1962 to set the Saihanba Mechanical Forest Farm, and sent 369 foresters, mostly in their 20s, to the area for tree planting.

The first group of foresters in Saihanba faced many challenges, equipped with only the simplest tools amid extreme coldness and drought. As result, they were unable to ensure the survival of trees planted. However, after the joint efforts of three generations, Saihanba was restored and turned back into a green paradise with a forest coverage raised from 11.4 percent to 80 percent, which can conserve and purify 137 million cubic meters of water every year.

The miraculous planting story of foresters in Saihanba gives rise to the concept of the Saihanba Spirit, defined as working hard, advancing against difficulties, forging ahead, and innovating boldly. As one of the largest man-made plantations in the world, the Saihanba Afforestation Community won the honor of Champions of the Earth in 2017 due to the efforts to transform degraded land into a green paradise. Now, the lush Saihanba has become home to thousands of species of flora and fauna for its good environment, and also attracts numerous tourists.

Around 80 intelligent terminals have been installed at the main entrance of the resort to check visitors' identities and health conditions. In addition, more than 22 mass temperature screenings have been set up inside the resort, according to UBR.

Apart from these screenings, announcements in both Chinese and English languages will be broadcast regularly. More than 100,000 signs have been put up to remind guests to wear masks and maintain social distancing. The resort management has made available 1,023 hand sanitizers stationed across the resort for convenient disinfection.

""I would have to say the key focus of anything we are doing right now is to ensure the safety of guests and to make sure we have proper pandemic controls in place,"" said Tom Mehrmann, president and general manager of the resort. ""We recognize what an important time it is right now in China to control the virus as well as to open safely.""

The Panamanian-flagged and Japanese-owned ship Ever Given on Friday crossed the Suez Canal for the first time since it blocked the waterway for six days in March, the Suez Canal Authority (SCA) said in a statement.

""The 400-metre, 220,000-ton container ship that was docked at the UK port of Felixstowe, has returned to Port Said on Thursday night,"" the statement.

""Accompanied by two tug boats and most professional guides, all security measures were taken to ensure the safe crossing of the ship,"" the SCA said.

The ship ran aground in Egypt's Suez Canal and jammed global shipping traffic for nearly a week until it was refloated on March 29 by a fleet of Egyptian tugboats and diggers.

The ship was seized for more than three months until the SAC and ship owner reached a deal in July allowing the vessel to leave Egyptian waters."

China held a meeting to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the peaceful liberation of Tibet in Lhasa, capital of southwest China's Tibet Autonomous Region, on Thursday. Wang Yang, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, delivered a speech and introduced Tibet's progress in economy, travel, education and cultural protection over past years.

Tourism development

Tibet is a popular tourist destination with a rich ethnic culture, natural resources and beautiful scenery. The region has 116 tourist areas with a continuously developing tourist industry and improving tourist facilities. According to Wang, during the 13th Five-Year Plan period (2016 – 2020), Tibet hosted close to 160 million tourists visits. The autonomous region now has a well-connected infrastructure, with Fuxing bullet trains travelling past snow-capped mountains.

Also, the Lhasa-Nyingchi Railway has begun operations since the end of June. It runs through southeast Tibet, allowing travelers to explore the magnificent hinterland. The 435-kilometer railway shortens the journey between Lhasa and Nyingchi by 3.5 hours. More than 106,000 passenger trips were recorded in the first month of operation with a daily average of 3,500 trips, according to a China State Railway Group statement released last week. Every administrative village is also linked by roads, and 140 flights connect Tibet with the rest of the country and other parts of the world, Wang added.

Cultural treasures

Besides the beautiful scenes, Tibet has been known of precious deposits of cultural treasures, which, after decades of exploration, are regaining glitz. The central government has invested a lot of manpower, resources and funding to preserve and develop Tibet's fine traditional culture. The Tibetan language is used extensively. Precious classics such as ""Epic of King Gesar"" were saved and collected, Wang said. Close to 800 projects, including thangka, Tibetan Opera and Tibetan medicine have been placed on the List of Intangible Cultural Heritage. In 2018, Tibetan medical bathing was listed in the World Intangible Cultural Heritage of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), bringing the land and the wisdom of its residents to the world once again.

Besides the ancient therapy, two other cultural items from Tibet have also been listed – Tibetan Opera and the ""Epic of King Gesar."" They are only a small piece of the cultural treasures on the plateau. Since Tibet launched its project on protecting the intangible cultural heritage in 2006, at least 300 million yuan (about $46.2 million) has been invested in the project, 195 million yuan of which from the central government. To preserve Tibet's cultural relics in the area, starting in 2016, the autonomous region's government built the Museum for Intangible Cultural Heritage, which was completed on May 18, 2018. As a region where religion plays a critical role, the rise and prosperity of the cultural resources could also be owed to the pervasiveness of Lamaism and the harmonious environment which breeds it.

According to a Xinhua report in 2018, Tibet has about 1,780 temples or sites where religious activities are conducted regularly, as well as more than 46,000 registered monks and nuns. Alongside Lamaism, other religions exist in the region, including Islam and Catholicism. The Potala Palace, the Jokhang Temple, and other temples and sites have been renovated and are under protection. Also, large-scale religious activities, such as Kora around holy mountains and rivers, Saga Dawa Festival, Shoton Festival, and Shining the Buddha, are all practiced, protected, and inherited, adding charm to the roof of the world. ""Today's Tibet enjoys freedom of religious belief, social harmony and ethnic amity,"" said Wang, ""We should protect and keep alive the fine traditional culture in Tibet and promote its creative evolution and development.""

Education and welfare

In addition to tourism development and the protection of cultural treasures, people's life in the region have improved over the past 70 years, which is reflected in education and medical care. Wang indicated that in old Tibet, over 90 percent of Tibetans struggled for subsistence, and up to 95 percent were illiterate. Today, hunger and poverty are a thing of the past for people of all ethnic groups in Tibet, and per capita living space in Tibet is close to 40 square meters. Also, the 15-year public-funded education is granted across the region, ending the long-standing issue of school dropouts, Wang said. Students attending public schools in Tibet can enjoy exemption of a list of fees, including tuition, accommodation, textbooks, meals, transportation and other miscellaneous costs, from preschool to senior high school. Parents who were once reluctant to send their children to school for fear of fees are now free from pressure.

Traditionally, Tibet's education was centered in and almost completely gripped by monasteries, except for a few old-style private schools. Back in that time, monks were teachers, lections were textbooks and praying halls were classrooms. There was no organized educational system nor an institution to take charge. The study of modern sciences, like math, physics and chemistry, was virtually nonexistent. Things began to change following the peaceful liberation in 1951 when the central government of the People's Republic of China and the local government of Tibet signed a 17-article agreement, in which they agreed ""school education of the Tibetan nationality shall be developed step by step.""

Tibet's modern education was virtually built from scratch. From the first Qamdo Primary School to a group of new primary schools in Xigaze, Chagyab, Bome, Nyingchi, Ngari and Lhasa that emerged afterward, Tibet's modern education system gradually came into being. Tibet now boasts an all-level education system that covers kindergarten, elementary, higher education, vocational education, adult education and special education."
1597,Tibet achieves great success in ecological protection,"As one of China's most important ecological security barriers, Tibet Autonomous Region in southwest China has made huge achievements in ecological protection.

Having the second largest wetland area in the country, Tibet has so far designated 70 percent of its wetlands as parks and conservation areas, with wetland protection becoming a part of locals' daily lives.

""If the wetland is not clean, it's like our home is not clean. We have to protect ecology, passing down the good environment from generation to generation,"" said Sonam Wangchen, a volunteer at Mirui Wetland Park."
1598,China sees significant progress in safeguarding cultural relics,"China has made remarkable improvement in the excavation, utilization and protection of cultural relics since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China in 2012, according to a report submitted on Wednesday for deliberations to the ongoing session of the Standing Committee of the 13th National People's Congress.

The country is home to 766,700 unmovable cultural relics, 108 million pieces (sets) of state-owned movable cultural relics and 56 UNESCO World Heritage sites, such as Liangzhu Archaeological Site and the ancient port of Quanzhou, the Emporium of the World in Song-Yuan China, according to the report from the State Council.

China has also made significant achievements in numerous archaeological projects, and strengthened archaeological work by approving the implementation of over 7,000 archaeological excavation projects, says the report.

Steady progress has been made in underwater archaeology, notes the report. For instance, over 180,000 pieces (sets) of cultural relics were excavated from Nanhai (South China Sea) No. 1, a cargo ship from the Song Dynasty (960-1279) salvaged in the South China Sea in 2007."

The park covers 54 hectares, is the largest sponge park in Shanghai, and is equipped to retain and purify water. The facility can absorb and collect water when it rains for use when necessary, as the whole park is like a gaint ""sponge.""

The concept of an ecological sponge park is based on the need to create a space that is environmentally sound and can absorb, purify and discharge stormwater, which is practical for a rainy city like Shanghai.

The park has an exhibition area that displays how water collection, purification and release process from its sedimentation tanks back to the river. The giant ""sponge"" is of great significance to the ecological protection of the region.

As it is connected with the Shanghai Astronomy Museum, the world's largest astronomy museum, the park is also full of astronomical elements.



It boasts eight well-designed structures and is divided into different functional areas, including a leisure star-gazing area and an astronomical experience area.



""One of the structures in the park is like a planet. We've named it 'the weightless planet,' in which visitors may experience the feeling of weightlessness in space,"" said Fan Jinlong, vice president of the China Construction Science and Technology Group Co., Ltd.



Visitors can also observe the stars at night at the park, according to Zhu Jian, director of the investment attraction department of Lingang business travel company.



""We will also organize various tent camps and astronomical activities outside the astronomy museum. Catering service with different contents and themes will also be set up in each of the eight supporting structures,"" said Zhu.

The Longmen Grottoes scenic spot in Luoyang City, central China's Henan Province, which was temporarily closed due to floods, has resumed daytime tours, July 26, 2021. /CFP

A total of 321 A-level scenic spots in central China's Henan Province have been damaged by floods since July 20.

Repair and reconstruction work is progressing in an orderly manner at the damaged scenic areas, the Information Office of Henan Provincial People's Government said at a press conference on Friday.

According to officials, the scenic spots suffered different degrees of damage. Some of the parking lots were flooded and roads were washed out, while homestays and tourist centers were destroyed. Power and water supplies were also partially damaged.

The economic losses of 10 scenic spots totaled more than 100 million yuan (about $15.43 million), and those of six scenic spots were more than 50 million yuan, including from flood damage and decreased operating income. A total of 13 5A scenic spots and more than 130 4A scenic spots in the province were severely damaged.

1605,Old wine in new bottle: Ancient Chinese wine attracts millennials,"02:12

The yellow rice wine, also known as ""huangjiu"" in Chinese, is regarded as one of the world's three major ancient alcoholic drinks – together with beer and wine. Widely known all over China, the grain-fermented drink is a staple of Shaoxing, a city in east China's Zhejiang Province. While sticking to its classic uses, over the years, people in Shaoxing have explored various new recipes for the yellow rice wine.

Head chef Chen Long, a 24-year-old man hailing from Shaoxing, cooks with yellow rice wine daily. ""Crabs or shrimps pickled with yellow rice wine are often on traditional Chinese menus. We also have more innovative recipes like chicken steamed with yellow rice wine,"" Chen said.

Crayfish pickled with yellow rice wine. /Li Xiquan Crayfish pickled with yellow rice wine. /Li Xiquan

Yellow rice wine is often used for seasoning. Its alchohol content is low, ranging from 14 to 20 percent. Once sealed in clay jars, it has a decades-long shelf life, mellowing with age. The brewcraft of the yellow rice wine has been passed down for more than 2,500 years. Its ancient craft is designated as one of China's national intangible cultural heritage. In the past, people used to unseal aged yellow rice wine on their children's coming-of-age day ceremonies. Like a time capsule, the wine carries people's best wishes for life.

For today's millennials, however, this centuries-old heritage is nothing more than an old-fashioned drink. For many, beer or grape wine are the more popular drink of choice. Attempting to revive yellow rice wine, winemakers are reshaping its image. Yellow rice wine-flavored popsicles, yogurt, or even milk tea, are the new trend among young adults in Shaoxing.

""The milk tea has a flavor of Shaoxing. It is very distinctive,"" one of the customers said. Ruan Shuai, deputy director of marketing at Yellow Wine Museum of China, said, ""We have introduced fashionable packaging and positioning to provide a new product image of yellow rice wine to consumers.""

To rejuvenate the treasured drink, Shaoxing Yellow Rice Wine Association holds an annual yellow rice wine carnival, catering to millennials. It also adopts new marketing strategies, such as engineered photo opportunities made for social media and live performances with rock bands. Now public perception is gradually changing.

""To Shaoxing people, yellow rice wine can be a sustenance with an emotional attachment to it and a lifestyle. We want to give it a new meaning, passing it down from generation to generation,"" Ruan said."

The exhibition opened with the display of 332 items of cultural relics of the Qin and Han dynasties, and will last until November 9. Among the items on display, some representative remains mark the identity, class and status of the top aristocrats of the Nanyue Kingdom. The architectural components, coins and wooden slips from the Nanyue Palace show the specifications of the high-level palaces and the luxurious life of the aristocrats at that time.

""The relics can reflect the major achievements of archaeological work in Guangzhou in recent years and show the historical and cultural features of the Lingnan area dating back to more than 2,000 years ago,"" said Zhai Shengli, the curator of the exhibition department at the museum. The gold dragon button seal unearthed at the Nanyue King tomb has attracted a lot of attention for its design, a legendary dragon-like tiger, and its material, which broke the rule that all imperial seals were made of white jade.

The gold seal was found between the chest and abdomen of the tomb owner, marking the most reliable evidence of the identity of the owner.



""The gold seal of the king of Nanyue, Zhao Mo, unearthed at the Nanyue King tomb is the largest gold seal excavated so far. It is also the only gold dragon button seal, which reflects the identity and status of the Nanyue rulers, and a series of historical facts recorded in the literature at that time,"" according to Zhai.



Jade burial suits were used by emperors and senior aristocrats in the Han Dynasty.



The corpse of Zhao and his jade burial suit, which is on display, were so decayed that the pieces of jade scattered on the ground after excavation. It took more than three years for the experts to restore the suit.



""The jade burial suit unearthed at the Nanyue King tomb is a relatively ancient suit in our archaeological findings. It is about a decade earlier than the jade clothes sewn with gold wire unearthed at the Han tombs of Mancheng. Besides, this jade burial suit is not sewn with gold, silver or copper wires as recorded in the literature, but sewn with silk threads,"" said Zhai.

Shanghai Acrobatic Troupe, a major Chinese acrobatic troupe, has opened the second season of its highly popular resident show ""Era – Intersection of Time."" This updated version of ""Era"" centers on a young man's encounter with a girl who lends him an umbrella on a rainy day. It follows his adventurous search for the mysterious young woman in Shanghai, which culminates when the two are reunited for a romantic dance on a giant iron ring. For the troupe's director Yu Yigang, it was all about making ""Era 2"" more relatable to the audiences, and this meant exploring new possibilities in traditional acrobatics. ""Acrobatics were often shown as individual acts with little or no coherence between the acts. Now as people's aesthetics grow, we're also exploring new possibilities of the art form with the 'Era' series, going back to its roots,"" Yu told CGTN.

Yu added that broadly speaking, zaji, or acrobatics, encompassed various performance skills that originated from daily life, as well as physical feats and martial arts. For instance, the tableware used in performances involving spinning plates and juggling jugs as well as the chairs stacked up for the balancing acts all come from dining rooms. ""In a sense, acrobatics is an art form that expresses people's energetic life forces from daily lives. And that's how we were able to make the acts more relatable to the audience, with the help of visual projections and new technologies,"" Yu said. Since the premiere of ""Era 1"" in 2005, the world of live entertainment has seen major changes, such as shows having more theatrical elements, according to Yu.

Today, acrobats need to be more than just agile athletes; they need to be entertainers and performers on stage, Yu told CGTN. ""In the past, acrobats only had to think about accomplishing their acts flawlessly, but now they have to engage with the audience in their performances to play a convincing role. That way their performance can truly reach the audience and resonate with them,"" he explained. It's equally important for modern shows to have a cultural identity.

""Sho"" means ""yogurt"" in the Tibetan language, ""ton"" means ""banquet"" or ""eating."" Thus, Shoton Festival can be translated as ""a festival for eating yogurt."" After years of development, it has evolved into one of the largest cultural tourism events in Lhasa.

Tibetan Opera has been one of the most popular activities during the weeklong gala. Last year, troupes from Qinghai, Sichuan, Gansu and Yunnan provinces went to Lhasa to join the Tibetan Opera performances. The festival is also called Tibetan Opera festival.



""Tibetan Opera mainly tells folktales and legends. It was once only favored by older audiences, but now more young people are interested,"" the head of Deashue Tibetan Opera Troupe told CGTN during an interview.

Located at the northwestern edge of the Taklamakan, the largest desert in China, Kekeya was notorious for its erratic weather and constant sandstorms.

""We have built a shelter forest on the edge of the city. The aim is mainly to prevent the invasion of wind and sand,"" said Zhang Zhijun, senior engineer of Aksu Forestry Bureau.

Song Jianjiang, a forest ranger of the Green Project, has lived in Kekeya since the tree-planting project began over three decades ago. ""The project has brought earth-shaking changes to Aksu's environment,"" Song said. ""Now, we see trees grow day after day, [with] blue skies and white clouds. The air quality is also very good. We are very proud and happy to see all this.""

Local officials said forests now cover at least 80,000 hectares of Kekeya's land, and dust storms are less frequent. The area now sees about 120 millimeters of rainfall per year.

The project has turned the desert into an oasis, attracting throngs of tourists to observe the beauty of the unique landscape."
1616,China's tourism hit hard as COVID-19 cases surge during summer holiday,"China's summer tourism has taken a big hit as local authorities ask people to avoid inter-provincial traveling. Following the latest wave of COVID-19 cases, the government has imposed restrictions on travel and shut down tourist spots in cities with medium and high-risk areas.

The country's tourism industry was hoping for a big recovery at this summer holiday, but the spreading Delta variant of the coronavirus has put an end to those hopes. Many travel agencies have lost almost all their bookings for the travel season.

""Ninety percent of our recent orders are gone. We're dealing with a large amount of refunds,"" said Zhen Hao, president of travel agency Easytour. ""Before the (virus) outbreak, we were very confident about the summer season and ready to recover our losses. But now, it's all gone.""

Official data shows the first half of 2021 saw only a 60 percent recovery in the number of domestic tourists for the same period in 2019. After a stricken 2020, tourism operators saw this summer holiday as a long-awaited opportunity.

Han Jie, vice president of CYTS AOYOU, one of the major travel agencies in China, told CGTN that summer holidays are normally the longest and most profitable time for the industry.

""Summer holidays are prime time for family travels. And it is the longest travel season for the whole year,"" Han added, ""We've developed so many family tour packages for the summer. Bookings were very hot, especially for places like Tibet, Xinjiang and Hainan.”"

Terminal 3 at Lhasa Gonggar Airport, the largest of its kind in southwest China's Tibet Autonomous Region, was put into operation on Saturday. Lhasa Gonggar Airport, at an elevation of 3,570 meters, is Tibet's largest aviation hub and one of the highest airports in the world. Construction began on the new terminal in late 2017 as a key project for the region during the 13th Five-Year Plan (2016-2020) period. After three years construction and months of intensive preparatory tests and trials of various airport systems, the airport's new Terminal 3 will start scheduled flight operations on August 7, the Tibet bureau of the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) announced earlier this week.

The new terminal has a parking apron with 21 aircraft stands, 40 check-in counters, 22 security channels, and 20 boarding gates. Most of the jet bridges are dual-channel bridges to split departing and arriving passengers and greatly improve the efficiency of the flow management. The overall design features diverse Tibetan cultural elements and its roof is painted in Tibetan gold and styled to the shape of a lotus. Additionally, it adopts giant skylights and glass curtain walls, allowing passengers to enjoy the blue sky, white clouds, abundant sunshine and stunning scenery gifted by the plateau region.

The UK government has issued the latest tweaks to its international COVID-19 travel policies in a boost to overseas summer holidays. Seven countries have been added to its Green List, meaning no quarantines are required upon arrival. However the travel sector and opposition politicians say there is still too much confusion and uncertainty.

From 4 a.m. on Sunday, fully vaccinated travelers arriving into the UK from France – many of them on Eurostar trains coming into the terminal at London's St. Pancras International station – will no longer have to quarantine at home for 10 days.

That's because France has been taken off the government's Amber-Plus List for international travel.

Another holiday hotspot Spain has been kept on the Amber List, despite concern over the Beta strain of COVID-19.

Moved onto Amber off the Red List – those countries from which require special hotel quarantine for 10 days – include India, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. Mexico has been put on Red.

Seven countries are now on the Green List – Germany, Austria, Norway and Romania among them.

The lists won't be reviewed for another three weeks which the transport secretary says balances caution with a level of relaxation that holiday makers can enjoy for the rest of August.

""You can never say zero chance with coronavirus,"" said Britain's Transportation Secretary Grant Shapps."

Locals are concerned over the recent outbreaks of COVID-19 cases in 15 Chinese provinces, which have been reported to be linked to cases from different overseas sources. In this context, what is the outlook for the upcoming back-to-school season? Can holiday travel continue unhindered? The Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism of the State Council of China held a press conference on Thursday to respond to these concerns and briefed the media about the further strengthening of COVID-19 containment measures.

""Judging from the overall current situation of the epidemic, one can say that it should be controllable,"" said He Qinghua, an inspector at the Bureau of Disease Control and Prevention of the National Health Commission. He said the current outbreak has a wide range and involves cases from different overseas sources, posing a challenge for containment efforts. However, as long as all prevention and control measures are strictly implemented, the epidemic can be controlled within two to three incubation periods, or four to six weeks if the latency period is calculated at 14 days, he said.

Back-to-school: Different schools, different policies

Liu Peijun, deputy director of the Ministry of Education's physical education, health and art department, also addressed parents' concerns at the press conference. The autumn back-to-school arrangement should be arranged according to local conditions to ensure the orderly start of the fall semester, he said. Liu said study stages as well as local conditions and situation of COVID-19 outbreaks are different in various provinces and regions. Therefore, the autumn semester this year should be arranged in accordance with the country's overall epidemic containment decisions as well as local actualities and policy arrangements. Considering its own situation and the realities of different schools, each province and city should decide on the specific arrangements for reopening schools, epidemic containment measures and teaching and educational activities, he explained. However, he said schools in medium-high risk areas should suspend in-person teaching activities and postpone the new semester. In fact, many provincial and municipal education departments have issued a variety of local policies. For example, Beijing requires students of its primary and secondary schools and kindergartens to return to Beijing 14 days before the start of the new semester and monitor their health situation daily, while Jiangxi, Henan, Hunan, Fujian and Heilongjiang provinces are speeding up the vaccination of minors.

Tourism: 1,152 A-level tourist sites closed

The Ministry of Culture and Tourism issued an emergency notice on Tuesday, stressing that indoor cultural and tourist activities should be restricted, closed or suspended in accordance with the local epidemic containment requirements to curb the virus spread. On Thursday, it issued a notice on inter-provincial tourism management, suspending inter-provincial group tourism and ""air ticket+hotel"" business for provinces or regions of medium-high risk areas.

As of Wednesday, 1,152 A-level tourist sites in 20 provinces and regions across China had been suspended in accordance with local epidemic prevention and control requirements, said Yu Changguo, an official with the ministry, on August 5."

1622,Canada's Quebec province to introduce vaccine passport,"Quebec announced Thursday it will introduce a vaccine passport, the first in Canada, to counter a fourth wave of the COVID-19 and the spread of the Delta variant.

""The principle behind the vaccine passport is that people who have made the effort to get their two doses should be able to live a semi-normal life,"" provincial prime minister Francois Legault told a press conference.

He added that the specific terms of the passport will be revealed in the coming days, but mentioned access to non-essential activities such as going to a restaurant.

Legault did not specify what date the pass will go into force in the province, where 83 percent of people over age 12 have received at least one vaccine shot, and 67 percent both.

""We will give certain privileges to those who have agreed to make the effort to get their two shots,"" Legault said.

As of Wednesday, Quebec had recorded 305 new cases in 24 hours, up from about 100 per day in recent days.

This increase is ""still much lower than what we see in the United States, in most of the countries in Europe, but it remains that we can already talk about the beginning of a fourth wave,"" Legault warned.

He ruled out the possibility of another lockdown in the province, however.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau backed the move, saying: ""I fully support the initiative of Mr Legault and the Quebec government.""

Trudeau also said he was considering the possibility of making vaccination mandatory for all federal employees."

Ongoing uncertainty

It's welcome news for the beleaguered travel industry, but industry figures say there is still too much uncertainty around the way the government makes its decisions.

""There is progress here and it's to be welcomed that some countries are opening up further. But it's still a complicated traffic light system,"" Paul Charles, CEO of travel consultancy The PC Agency, told CGTN, criticizing the latest reshuffle.

""It doesn't go far enough in widening the list of green countries. There are many countries eligible to be green. And it doesn't address one of the key issues that consumers have, which is which is around the lack of notice before a country changes color.

""If I make a booking as a consumer, I want to make sure that I'm not going to be charged more if I have to change my booking at the last minute,"" said Charles. ""And the government is not guaranteeing that it won’t change countries at short notice.""

France was only put on the amber-plus list three weeks ago – which shows just how quickly the situation can change.

And while vaccinated vacationers can now enjoy a measure of more freedom this summer, if we’ve learned anything this year – it's that coping with COVID-19 means long-term predictions impossible to make."

The dragon boat race was performed for the first time in the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games, introducing ancient Chinese culture to the rest of the world. The ten-minute performance has been displayed between canoe races at the Sea Forest Waterway from August 2 to 7, kicking off the procedure of the dragon boat race entering the Olympic Games.

Origin of the dragon boat race As a representative of Chinese culture, the dragon boat race is best known and long believed as a traditional practice of the Dragon Boat Festival to commemorate the patriotic poet Qu Yuan (340 B.C.-278 B.C.) during the Warring States period of ancient China. But according to the book ""Yuanling Millennium Dragon Boat,"" the dragon boat originated in what is now Yuanling County, central China's Hunan Province, 5,000 years ago, which is much earlier than the living time of Qu. It was in the Sui (581-619) and Tang (618–907) Dynasties, paddling the dragon boat became the festival customs practiced on the fifth day of the fifth Chinese lunar month every year.

Today, paddling the dragon boat has changed from a memorial event to a race event.

Difference between competitive and traditional dragon boat races The competitive dragon boat race is different from the traditional dragon boat race. Traditionally, there are three different paddling postures – paddlers can sit, kneel or stand on the boat. Since 2008, the International Dragon Boat Federation has stipulated paddlers to take the seat posture in all international dragon boat races.

Surrounded by deserts and mountains, Turpan is well-known for its immense summertime heat energy, which has provided favorable resources for developing sectors of thermal therapy, healthcare service, eco-tourism and sand-heating cure, among a host of other applications in light of its geographical and climate conditions.

According to the local meteorological bureau, the Flaming Mountain scenic area, a tourist attraction known for its fire-like sandstone, has recently seen its temperature surge to the highest in a year, with the maximum daytime temperature of around 45 degrees Celsius.

Readings from a giant thermometer standing in the scenic spot show surface temperature can reach some 70 degrees Celsius every day between 3 p.m. and 4 p.m.

Many tourists flock to the Flaming Mountain during the summer holiday season.

Local vendors are ready to impress people traveling from other places with eggs cooked in hot sand. It takes about an hour to cook the eggs in a sandpit, but the unique cooking method, the ""egg hill,"" has attracted many travelers and shutterbugs.

The sand serves not only as an oven but also as a bath tube.

Lake Balaton is the country's most popular tourism destination, a favorite for families looking to swim and sail over the decades. It's now transforming with a growing cultural scene. The area is famous for its wines, with many of the vineyards overlooking the distinctive blue lake.

Homola winery owner Szabolcs Homola told CGTN the last 12 months have been a struggle with restrictions and decreased hospitality orders – but it's starting to change.

""Tourism in Budapest was hit hard, I have businesses there as well, it's still very difficult to survive there,"" he said. ""However countryside tourism, internal tourism, thrives.""

This year Balaton's accommodation was booked out months before the summer tourism window began – with Hungarians more confident booking holidays when the government began lifting restrictions earlier than other countries. The restrictions began to lift at the end of spring, based on the number of first dose vaccines.

Istvan Szelei, from Budapest-based travel operator Multigo Tours, explained that people are much more willing to bet on a holiday here this year.

""They think 'Okay, we are vaccinated, we've done our stuff within the country, but we don't know what other countries have done – so let's stay here for another year, and next year we will go outside,"" he said.

Variants and administration

Around Balaton festivals like the annual Jazz Picnic draw in close to 20,000 people over a weekend, the numbers back on track after last year's event was canceled.

Many of those traveling to the festival told CGTN they had come from Budapest and would usually spend their holidays overseas. One couple explained many Hungarians won't travel abroad as they're concerned about virus variants and the ongoing administration involved with overseas trips.

Tourism experts say 80 percent of Hungarian holidaymakers have opted to stay in the country because of the pandemic. The younger age groups are the most likely to head overseas, with those in their twenties particularly taking advantage of increased flights to Greece, where the tourism industry reopened months before other countries.

While Hungarians are hesitant to go overseas, the number of tourists coming into Hungary is also seriously affected. Inbound tourism providers are holding on for next year, while the domestic tourism industry begins to recover.

Winery owner Szabolcs Homola explained that luckily for the Balaton region, its recovery is slightly ahead. ""The tourism sector in the whole country will need at least two more years to get back,"" he said, ""but here in Lake Balaton next year we will get to the old numbers, where we were before.""

The United Kingdom's decision to maintain restrictions only for French travelers is a ""discriminatory"" move, French Minister of State for European Affairs Clement Beaune said on Thursday, calling on Britain to review it ""as soon as possible.""

""It's excessive, it's frankly incomprehensible on health grounds and discriminatory towards the French,"" Beaune told LCI television.

""It's not based on science. There is no justification for this decision, I hope that it will be reviewed as soon as possible,"" he said.

Starting from Aug. 2, vaccinated visitors from the United States and the European Union will no longer need to quarantine on arrival in England, the British government announced on Wednesday.

Travelers who are fully vaccinated in the United States and European Union, except France will be allowed entry in England without having to quarantine on arrival, the UK government announced on Wednesday.

""We're helping reunite people living in the US and European countries with their family and friends,"" Transport Secretary Grant Shapps tweeted.

Travelers fully jabbed with a vaccine approved by the US Food and Drug Administration or the European Medicines Agency will be able to travel from any country on the British government's ""amber"" traffic light list without having to self-isolate at home for 10 days.

They will still need to do a pre-departure test and take another test on day two after arriving in England.

Separate rules will continue to apply for those arriving from France due to the government's concern over the ""persistent presence"" of the Beta variant, which is believed to be more resistant to vaccines.""

Those traveling from an amber list country, which includes most of Europe and the US, who are not fully vaccinated will still have to quarantine on arrival.

""By reopening quarantine-free travel for travelers who have been fully vaccinated in European countries and the U.S., we're taking another step on the road to normality which will reunite friends and families and give UK businesses a boost,"" Health Secretary Sajid Javid said.

The government also confirmed the restart of international cruises.

""This is progress we can all enjoy,"" wrote Shapps.

Britain is in the midst of another wave of the virus due to the Delta variant, although case numbers have dropped over the past week, while its vaccine drive has seen more than 70 percent of adults fully jabbed.

The lighthouse was designed by engineer Louis de Foix and was later remodeled by engineer Joseph Teulere in the late 18th century.



Describing it as a ""masterpiece of maritime signaling,"" the committee said, ""Cordouan's monumental tower is decorated with pilasters, columns, modillions and gargoyles.""



""It embodies the great stages of the architectural and technological history of lighthouses and was built with the ambition of continuing the tradition of famous beacons of antiquity, illustrating the art of building lighthouses in a period of renewed navigation, when beacons played an important role as territorial markers and as instruments of safety.""



The increase in its height in the late 18th century and changes to its light chamber at the same time were also noteworthy, the committee said.

As the core exhibit of the ""Return of National Treasures"" theme exhibition, the head of the Buddha appeared in the Tianlongshan Grottoes Museum. The exhibition comprehensively tells the history of the loss and return of the relics of the Tianlongshan Grottoes through the use of precious cultural relics, historical pictures, digital restoration, and 3D printing of the grottoes.

Yu Hao, curator of the Tianlongshan Grottoes Museum, explained why the head of the Buddha was not put back in its original location. He said that the cave wall where the head of the Buddha was originally located was close to the cliff body, which was badly cracked. If the head of the Buddha was placed in its original position, it would be difficult to avoid some degree of weathering. So the Buddha head will be preserved and permanently displayed in the museum. Specially designed lighting and display cases in the exhibition hall will be able to protect the Buddha head to a greater extent.

Zhang Rong, an overseas Chinese living in Japan and the donor of the Buddha head, said, ""The donation of the Buddha head is a milestone in my life. At least I have done what I should do. I have brought the Buddha head, which has been separated from its body for a hundred years, to return to my motherland.""

In addition, Zhang has decided to donate the 300,000 yuan (about $46,286) awarded by the government to support the recovery of cultural relics, so that more national treasures can be returned to the motherland in the future."

First online session Organized by UNESCO in cooperation with the host country China, the annual session is for the first time being held online. The WHC has 21 State Parties. To coordinate the time difference, the daily plenary sessions of the Committee lasts only four hours, usually from 17:30 to 21:30 Beijing time. How to effectively conduct the deliberations within limited time serves as a reference for the session's future online-offline work in the post-pandemic era. A series of side events include the World Heritage Young Professionals Forum, the World Heritage Site Managers' Forum, and eight side meetings hosted solely by China.

Categories of World Heritage The World Heritage refers to the unique and irreplaceable cultural and natural heritage considered to be of ""Outstanding Universal Value"" to humanity irrespective of the territory on which they are located. The representatives are China's Great Wall and the Forbidden City, Egypt's Great Pyramids and Brazil's Central Amazon Conservation Complex. World Heritages are divided into three categories: the natural, the mixed, and the cultural. When a property is recognized as the World Heritage, it usually gets increased worldwide attention and sometimes the financial support such as the World Heritage Fund, and its tourism is promoted, bringing in rich economic benefits. As a part of a nation's soft power, it can also enhance its self-confidence, pride and international recognition. As of June 2021, there are 1,121 monuments in 167 State Parties listed as World Heritage Sites, including 39 mixed, 213 natural and 869 cultural properties. China and Italy boasts 55 World Heritage Sites each, leading the world.

Great Barrier Reef and others in the spotlight Before the opening of each session, WHC's advisory bodies – the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and the International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS) – give their recommendations on the property to be inscribed on the list. Besides nominations, there are also 258 properties on the list to be examined for their state of conservation this year. Much attention has been drawn to some properties recommended to be listed as endangered or be deleted from the list. In recent years, marine ecosystems of the Great Barrier Reef have deteriorated at an unprecedented rate and scale. Despite Australia's efforts to implement its Reef 2050 Long-Term Sustainability Plan, the impacts of climate change, including a series of coral bleaching events in 2016, 2017, and 2020, have already taken a significant toll on the property. Also, the worsening water quality is reducing the reef's resiliency. Previously, the IUCN has recommended it inscribed on the List of World Heritage in Danger to urge strengthened global efforts to protect the Great Barrier Reef. On Friday, the Committee agreed not to place the property on the ""danger list,"" but asked Australia to submit a progress report by February 2022. Other properties on the spotlight include Liverpool – Maritime Mercantile City (the UK), which was removed from the World Heritage List on Wednesday, and Venice and its Lagoon (Italy) and Budapest (Hungary) narrowly escaped from being designated as endangered World Heritage Sites on Thursday.

1654,A heritage map of Quanzhou: Emporium of the World in Song–Yuan China,"The ancient port of Quanzhou is seeking, for the second time, World Heritage status. The proposal, ""Quanzhou: Emporium of the World in Song–Yuan China,"" to get the coveted tag will be evaluated by the World Heritage Committee during its 44th session held in southeast China's Fuzhou and online.

Quanzhou, on the southeastern coast of China, was one of the world's largest and busiest ports during the Song (960-1279) and Yuan (1271-1368) dynasties and is believed to be the starting point of the ancient Maritime Silk Road and a vital exchange hub for different civilizations and religions.

Today, the city, known as Zayton overseas, is home to more than eight million people as well as a significant number of cultural relics and religious sites, such as Qingjing Mosque, one of the oldest mosques in the country, and the Twin Stone Pagodas at Kaiyuan Temple, which are the highest pair of stone pagodas in China.

It is the second time that Quanzhou has applied for inclusion on the World Heritage List. The previous proposal for ""Historic Monuments and Sites of Ancient Quanzhou (Zayton),"" which includes 16 component sites, was ""deferred"" by the committee at the 42nd session in 2018."

The name of the mountain, Sanqing, means ""Three Pure Ones"" in Chinese as it has three main summits: Yujing, Yushui and Yuhua, representing Taoism's three most important deities. Due to faults, weathering and erosion, the rocks and peaks in the area are intricately shaped. Apart from the magnificent landform, delicate forest cover, ever-shifting weather patterns as well as high biodiversity are also the features of this area.

In 2008, UNESCO inscribed Mount Sanqingshan as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. According to UNESCO, Mount Sanqingshan National Park displays a unique array of forested, fantastically shaped granite pillars and peaks concentrated in a relatively small area. The looming, intricate rock formations intermixed with delicate forest cover and ever-shifting weather patterns create a landscape of arresting beauty.

The Philippines will ban inbound travelers from Malaysia and Thailand from July 25 to 31 to prevent the spread of the highly infectious coronavirus Delta variant, presidential spokesperson Harry Roque said on Friday.

Roque said travelers coming directly from the two Southeast Asian countries or with a history of travel to any of the two countries within the last 14 days would be barred from entering.

""This action is undertaken to prevent the further spread and community transmission of COVID-19 variants in the Philippines,"" Roque said in a statement.

Malaysia and Thailand are experiencing a surge believed to be driven by the Delta variant cases.

Roque said that returning overseas Filipino workers under the government repatriation program are exempted from the ban but will be isolated for 14 days upon arrival.

The inclusion of Malaysia and Thailand brings to 10 the list of countries banned by the Philippines. Travelers from Indonesia, India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Oman and the United Arab Emirates are not allowed to enter the country until July 31.

The Philippines has detected 47 Delta cases in the country so far. The Department of Health confirmed the local transmission of the Delta variant first detected in India.

Aside from the Delta variant, the Philippines has also detected three other coronavirus variants of concern.

The Philippines has reported a total of 1,530,266 confirmed COVID-19 cases as of Friday, including 26,891 deaths."
1658,Reporter's Diary in Xinjiang: Of legendary myths and experiences,"CGTN reporter Chuck Tinte poses on top of the Banlange grasslands overlooking the Kunlun Mountains. Yu Chuan/CGTN CGTN reporter Chuck Tinte poses on top of the Banlange grasslands overlooking the Kunlun Mountains. Yu Chuan/CGTN

There's something about legends of mythical kingdoms and beasts that fascinate me. Hotan – an oasis town in southern Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region – has multitudes of such stories, most significantly that of the Kunlun Mountains. According to ancient Chinese mythology, Kunlun was a dwelling place of gods and goddesses. It's also home to majestic animals that are white as snow and trees that bear jewelry like pearl and jade.

Stoned for the gods

One of our first stops in Hotan was in Moyu County. There we met Ahmattohti Tohtiniyaz, a Uygur man who sells Hotan jade. Major deposits of these precious and rare gemstones are said to be tucked away deep in the Kunlun Mountains. And the Chinese people consider them as ""the essence of heaven and earth.""

Precious jade sold by Uygur businessman Ahmattohti Tohtiniyaz. Chuck Tinte/CGTN Precious jade sold by Uygur businessman Ahmattohti Tohtiniyaz. Chuck Tinte/CGTN

To be honest, I never really knew how valuable jade was. I'm only most familiar of it because of jade rollers, a beauty tool used for face massage. They could cost at least 10 yuan or a little over a dollar at a popular shopping street in Beijing. You can only imagine my reaction when Ahmattohti told me how much real jade costs! One stone the size of your thumb had been priced up to 100,000 yuan ($15,625). I was shook! He said he'd been trading and selling jade for about 11 years now. He's ventured into live-streaming to expand his business.

Divine and elegant

When I think of myths and legends, I imagine warriors and deities wearing lavish attires. At Hotan's famous food market I was treated to such elegance. Nightly performances there showcase not just graceful moves, but also performers wearing traditional ethnic clothing.

Performers are seen on stage at Hotan night market. Yu Chuan/CGTN Performers are seen on stage at Hotan night market. Yu Chuan/CGTN

I repeated one word over and over as performers came out one after the other: fab! Bustling with people every night, southern Xinjiang's famous night market not only features mouth-watering eats but also sophistication through dance and music.

Sound of Music-ing

Think Julie Andrews on top of the hill, singing her lungs out. My feeling on top of Qira county's Banlange grasslands was, well, very that. We were over 3,000 meters above sea level overlooking the Kunlun Mountains.

00:23

It was magical. There we met a local family having a picnic. They were dancing to Uygur folk music when we decided to crash the party. And while I wouldn't normally twirl and pirouette in front of strangers sober, I happily agreed to their invitation to join them.

Grilled lamb and naan, a traditional Uygur meal. Chuck Tinte/CGTN Grilled lamb and naan, a traditional Uygur meal. Chuck Tinte/CGTN

After about five minutes of working my two no-so-left feet, it was time to eat. They were gracious enough to share their meal – grilled lamb placed on top of a huge naan which was quite possibly the best one I've ever had. It was soft and fluffy in the center and had an incredibly crunchy crust. Food for the gods, I thought.

Then I saw a guitar, to which I asked if I can borrow. I silently played a random Filipino song, until suddenly I noticed people listening in. I shifted to an English song which I knew some people could sing along to. Until Matsen, one of our guides (and now, friend) asked if I can play a famous Chinese song entitled ""peng you"" which means friend in English. I knew the chords were pretty basic as I remember winging it once at a pub in Beijing. So I agreed.

China's National Cultural Heritage Administration has enhanced efforts to protect cultural relics against floods as heavy rainfall has lashed many parts of China, reported Xinhua News Agency.

Department and institutions responsible for protecting ancient relics and cultural sites across the country should pay close attention to weather forecasts and geological disasters warnings and take effective measures, according to a notice.

Cultural relics institutions and museums should formulate plans for responding to major floods and natural disasters in response to risks such as the destruction of ancient bridges, the collapse of ancient city walls, ancient buildings, and ancient trees, said the administration.

Also, the relevant departments should report damage suffered by historical sites during disasters, the administration added. Furthermore, emergency plans should be launched immediately, appropriate and effective measures should be taken to organize rescue and relief work, and follow-up protection work should be done properly, including collecting and preserving cultural relics' components, organizing the repairment and restoration of cultural relics, and minimizing the damage.

The heaviest spell of rain on Tuesday in central China's Henan Province caused severe damage to Zhengzhou City and Luoyang City, where cultural relics are concentrated.

As a result, water has seeped into a few museums and archaeological sites. For example, in Zhengzhou Shang City archaeological site, Longmen Grottoes, Shaolin Temple, and other places, the protective soil layer of the buildings and sites collapsed a little, but the cultural relics themselves are temporarily safe.

In response, cultural relics departments across Henan Province are making all-out efforts to ensure cultural relics and personnel safety."

1690,Transcript: Liu Xin interviews Sten Vermund on virus origins tracing,"25:30

The U.S. intelligence community has failed to shed any new light on the origins of SARS-CoV-2, and no evidence had been found to suggest that a lab in Wuhan was unsafe or tinkering with the virus. This did not come as a surprise for many given the deep scientific nature of thus task. But where should people look next? What is holding up the progress of the COVID-19 origins study? What are the ramifications of the anti-China rhetoric peddled by politicians in some countries on cross-border scientific cooperation? Earlier, Liu Xin spoke with Prof. Sten Vermund, Dean of the Yale School of Public Health. He is an infectious disease epidemiologist focusing on diseases in low and middle-income countries. Below is a transcript of the interview. Liu Xin: Let's talk about the origins tracing study of COVID-19. Where most likely do you think COVID-19 originated? How do you regard the equivalence given by some in the scientific community to both the natural origins hypothesis and the lab leak hypothesis? Dr. Sten Vermund: These are excellent questions. We believe that coronaviruses are largely in bat populations. There were four coronaviruses circulating in humans before SARS. Then we had SARS, then we had MERS. Now we have the novel coronavirus. So that makes seven in total. The previous six seemed to be of natural origin. We have not had the good fortune in the case of novel coronavirus to identify a clear intermediate animal host. There's been an intensive search, but it's not obvious whether something similar to SARS occurred, such as a wet market exposure in sort of the exotic food industry, or whether there was some other exposure. The lab accidents hypothesis doesn't have any evidence to back it up, so it remains just that – just a hypothesis. Liu Xin: But by and large, you believe the novel coronavirus came from nature? Dr. Sten Vermund: It's far more likely that it came from nature than through some laboratory accident. The virology lab in Wuhan, as with modern virology labs around the world, take extraordinary precautions for the security of their products and the personal protective equipment for virologists working with potentially serious agents is very fastidious. And I think it would be very improbable that a lab accident were responsible for this release.

The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Beijing, China, September 1, 2020./ CFP The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Beijing, China, September 1, 2020./ CFP

Liu Xin: There have been multiple studies about possible earlier emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in other parts of the world, prior to Wuhan. For instance, in Europe, in Italy, there has been this paper where researchers believe or assess that there is a high possibility that COVID-19 was already circulating in northern Italy in late June to late August of 2019. And similar studies also emerged in the other parts of the world, for instance, in the United States. You must have also read where they analyzed blood samples from the American Red Cross, where they found that, you know, the actual emergence time of this disease is earlier than the believed January of 2020. Instead, it's believed to be somewhere in early December 2019, if not earlier. So, what do these findings tell you, reveal to you, about what may have happened before Wuhan? Dr. Sten Vermund: These are intriguing and confusing reports. We had the same phenomenon with HIV. HIV was not recognized until about 1981. But there are a number of studies looking at blood samples from 1975, even 1965, there's one study from the 1950s, stating that there was HIV and humans at that time. Unfortunately, it's hard to replicate these studies when they come from unique blood specimens. One can't be absolutely sure. We rely very heavily on replication in science. The studies from Italy, the United States and elsewhere, suggesting that novel coronavirus, the SARS-CoV-2, actually was in humans well before the Wuhan outbreak, that falls in the same category. Very intriguing and very suggestive, but not very definitive, because we would like to see replication. In these other reports, they were not associated with a clinical outbreak. So we didn't fill up the hospitals with patients. If this virus was circulating, perhaps it was a different strain, a different variant. Perhaps it was not as pathogenic to humans. These are the sorts of things people are trying to investigate right now. Liu Xin: Where do you think people should look next for clues if finding the origins of SARS-CoV-2 is very important? Dr. Sten Vermund: The tie between bats, intermediate hosts and humans is the most productive line of investigation, in my view.

Liu Xin: So, you must have been reading the press. And obviously, there has been, I don't know whether you notice, but there has been a large volume of reports, even editorials pointing to the Wuhan lab leak hypothesis and pressing China to open it up or to accept audits, even if scientists have already visited. What do you make of such a push for so-called greater transparency on China? Dr. Sten Vermund: I don't think it should be unique to China. I think all of the world's virology labs and biology labs that handle potentially dangerous substances should cooperate with the World Health Organization, and they should cooperate with each other to try to maintain safety standards at the highest level. This is why licensure of such labs is done in China, as well as it is also done in Europe and North America, why there are rigorous safety protocols in place where you can have spot audits, where visitors come in representing regulatory agencies to check that everything is being done properly. We've had quite a number of laboratory errors around the world, including in the United States, so we must maintain a strong level of security and vigor. In the United States, you may recall, in 2001, the month after 9/11, we had the anthrax outbreak, and this was a bioterrorism event that seems to have been promulgated by a former employee of a major bio-secure laboratory. And it looks like he stole the anthrax spores from the laboratory and used them for domestic bio terrorism. So how can someone take a product and deliberately removed it from the lab, and nobody else knows? That's an example of where we have to be very vigilant in laboratories. And that goes for Fort Detrick, Maryland, and that goes for the CDC and that goes for the China CDC and that goes for the Wuhan virology labs. All of them need to be guaranteed secure and safe. I have no evidence that the Wuhan lab was not doing a good job. In fact, the WHO investigation suggests that it was doing a good job. And now the Biden administration, those data are not available fully yet, but they seem to be, from the executive summary, there is no information to suggest the Wuhan lab was unsafe in any way.

Liu Xin: Yeah, exactly. As you mentioned, on August the 27th, the U.S. intelligence community after a 90-day investigation, failed to come to any kind of conclusive assessment as to the origins of COVID-19. Of course, we do not know the full content of that report. What is your comment on what we know from the report and its findings? Dr. Sten Vermund: I only know what I've read, which is limited, similar to what you've read. It looks like it will be an inconclusive report. They will not be able to assess the Wuhan lab security, and they will not be able to make any kind of conclusion. It seems not to have been a fruitful investigation. My own view is that the intelligence agencies of the United States may do a fine job in assessing political or military vulnerability or risk, but I'm not sure they're the most qualified to evaluate a virology lab. Liu Xin: What do you think has led to the current impasse or pause, let's say, in the progress toward understanding the origins of the virus? What do you think are the forces, if there are any, that have been behind such a stalemate? Dr. Sten Vermund: That's an excellent question. Scientists like to collaborate with each other. And politics rarely interferes. We would like to get to the bottom of a mystery and find out where, for example, coronavirus came from. I would love to have a bilateral arrangement, the Chinese government, U.S. government, both fund teams, that would actually work together. Study bat virus, coronaviruses, study potential intermediate hosts, try to get to the bottom of the origin of the virus. If they want to look at laboratory safety, they can do that too. Right now, our collegial relations are not what they used to be. I can imagine a study like that being done 10 years ago, and both governments being very supportive. But today, we are paying the price of the anti-Sino rhetoric of our previous president. And I think our Congress has, unfortunately, taken a sort of negative view of China. But we scientists don't share this view. We think that Chinese science is powerful, and Chinese scientists are among the leading thinkers worldwide. We welcome the opportunity to collaborate with Chinese scientists to get to the bottom of important medical mysteries.

Liu Xin: Who should be leading this job? I mean, right now, there has been a mechanism under the mandate of the World Health Assembly resolution. A group of international scientists have been selected to come and collaborate with Chinese scientists, and they did some job, and they came up with a report. But so far, it has been stalled. The report has come under a lot of criticism that these group of scientists have to come out and publish an explanatory opinion piece in a scientific magazine most recently. So, who should be assigned to do this very important job under the existing environment that we have? Dr. Sten Vermund: First of all, I don't think you can get to the bottom of a major scientific question with a two-month review. Where do these viruses come from? Are they actually of bat origin, which is what we think? Which animals might they be infecting? Which animals might be most likely to result in human infection? These are the big questions, and these cannot be answered in 30, 60, 90 days. So we're going to need strong multidisciplinary teams of scientists, preferably an international team, which will increase the credibility of science, I think. Liu Xin: Yeah, indeed, you're talking about a very ideal situation, but it seems to be very difficult at this moment, right? To have this kind of pure ideal scientific collaboration. But anyway, that's the kind of wish or idea that should be expressed to, you know... Dr. Sten Vermund: I don't think we should give up. I don't think we should give up because top Chinese scientists are best friends of top American and European scientists. These people can work together like that. So, I think it may be time for some of our political leaders to let bygones be bygones.

Liu Xin: I hope that is the case, too. Let's talk a bit about the new variant, the kind of threat that COVID-19 continues to pose to us. Now, at this moment, a new variant called Mu has just been added to the WHO's list of variants of interests. And cases of this variant have been reported in the U.S., in Colombia, and the Republic of Korea and Europe. How serious a threat is this likely to pose based on what we saw about Delta already? Dr. Sten Vermund: We don't know yet. We simply don't have enough information. The same is true for Lambda variant, which was also described not long ago. RNA viruses mutate at very high rates. And that's true for HIV, that's true for influenza, and it's true for coronavirus. Because we have so many people around the world who are infected with coronavirus, the replication happening in humans is happening, multiplies by millions and millions of people. So there inevitably will be variants that emerge that are not self-destructing. Most variants cause a defect in the virus that makes it less competitive and less able to replicate. But occasionally, a mutation, such as the one in the Delta variant, can actually give the virus a competitive advantage in survival. That's why in my state of Connecticut here in the United States, it's almost all Delta, because it's crowded out the other variants. Liu Xin: Is there anything that people can do to try to tame or at least slow down the rate of mutation? Or it's really out of our control, and we can only try to catch up with the speed of vaccination and to add booster shots, to try to tame the new variants? Dr. Sten Vermund: There are definitely two things that people can do to try to help tame variants. Number one is to get vaccinated because if you stimulate your immune response to see the virus through the vaccine, and then if you do get infected later on, we would expect much milder disease. And that will likely reflect much less viral activity and viral replication. Second way is what China has done, which is a rigorous public health application of classic tools, such as masks, physical distancing, control of transportation, indoor air quality, outdoor activities, widespread testing, hand hygiene. So, all of these traditional public health strategies also reduce replication of virus by limiting viral spread.

Liu Xin: So, there are two different kinds of approach. One is what China does - try to get it down to zero. And the other is like, for instance, in the UK where they vaccinate as many people as possible, but then try to live with it. And then you have something, which is happening in the United States. You have a certain population, which refuses to be vaccinated. So, in this kind of mixture of responses, is the virus always going to find some kind of free room to develop, to flourish, and to mutate and continue to exist? How long is it going to last? Dr. Sten Vermund: If in places like the UK and the U.S. we can achieve herd immunity, such that enough people are vaccinated, that the rest of the transmission cycle sort of dies out. You end up with very few new infections. Because if you have an infectious person, but most of the people around this person are immune, then that's severely limits the spread of the virus. China can accomplish the same thing with widespread vaccination. So at that point, perhaps society can more or less get back to normal. However, I think the donor nations, like China, the Europeans, North Americans, will be under a strong self-interested as well as humanitarian motive to help the low-income countries also vaccinate their populations. Because if we control viral spread in middle-income and high-income countries, then it will still be seen in low-income countries. So, it's in everyone's self-interest to enable them to also vaccinate. I was in the country of Chad last week in central Africa, and less than one-tenth of one percent of the population has been vaccinated to date. There are many countries that have received a small fraction of the vaccine that they need and have deployed even less. In so far as we're able to help those nations cover their population, then we can have a more definitive global solution.

Liu Xin: How about the situation in those countries that you just mentioned? For instance, of course they don't have the protection of the vaccine, but is the virus running rampant or with some traditional measures, they are able to more or less keep things under control? Dr. Sten Vermund: It's a mixed setting. Some countries like South Africa, India, Brazil have struggled mightily and have had tremendous pandemic spread. Other countries, like the one I was in, in Chad, have not seen much serious COVID today, partly because of relative isolation and strong border controls, particularly airport controls. The borders themselves are quite porous. So, people for example in N'Djamena, the capital of Chad, is right across the river from Cameroon, and the bridges are full of people coming and going all hours of the day and night. So, the borders themselves are porous, but the airports are the most notorious for people bringing virus in from far away. There, they've had very rigorous control. Testing is required before they get on the airplane, testing is required as soon as they arrive. In fact, most of the testing in Chad has been done on travelers. So, to date, they don't have a serious epidemic. And it gives us the opportunity, it's a limited window of time, to aggressively vaccinate before they have a huge surge of virus.

1691,Chinese officials slam U.S. manipulation of COVID-19 origins tracing,"The United States has been using the COVID-19 pandemic as a tool of political manipulation against China despite China's openness, transparency and cooperation with all parties in tracking down the origins of the lethal virus, said Chinese ambassador Anwar Habibullah to Bahrain recently.

In an op-ed in Bahrain's the Daily Tribune, the ambassador said that while the international community is working hard to overcome the epidemic, ""the United States, out of its own interests, neglected the international consensus of fighting against COVID-19 corporately and scientifically.""

The so-called report on the origins of COVID-19 compiled by the U.S. intelligence community recently ""is a mendacious report made up for political purposes,"" stressed the Chinese ambassador.

""China has always followed the principles of openness, transparency, and responsibility to introduce the virus information to the world, share the genome sequence of the virus, and carry out anti-epidemic cooperation.""

The first suspicious COVID-19 case found in China was reported to local authorities on December 27, 2019 and an emergency notice was later issued. On December 31, 2019, China reported relevant information to the World Health Organization (WHO), the diplomat said.

He stressed China has demonstrated a scientific, professional, serious, and responsible attitude from the beginning, and since last year invited WHO experts twice to China to track down patient zero.

""China's open and transparent attitude on the issue of COVID-19 origins tracing was fully affirmed by international experts,"" stated the Chinese ambassador."
1692,U.S. risks becoming an unreliable partner in fighting future pandemics,"Editor's note: Adriel Kasonta is a London-based foreign affairs analyst and commentator. He is the founder of AK Consultancy and former chairman of the International Affairs Committee at Bow Group, the oldest conservative think tank in the UK. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

Ever since the COVID-19 pandemic began, the U.S. government has already decided about its origins. The virus, as first argued by then President Donald Trump and pushed by then Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, was believed to be the product of the Chinese government's malicious intent and a potential bio-weapon produced to harm the ""free world.""

Although the U.S. intelligence community on April 30, 2020, issued a statement that it ""concurs with the wide scientific consensus that the COVID-19 virus was not manmade or genetically modified,"" once the ""China virus"" propaganda was spread, it managed to harbor a seed of doubt in the global consciousness, giving rise to extreme Sinophobia both at home and abroad.

Despite pinning high hopes on President Joe Biden to break with the destructive practices of stigmatization cherished by his predecessor, the new commander-in-chief decided to ask the intelligence community on May 26 to ""redouble their efforts"" within 90 days in hopes of finding a ""definitive conclusion"" about the coronavirus origins amid growing attention to the so-called lab-leak hypothesis.

The report published late August from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, which oversees the nation's 18 spy agencies, informed that the conducted investigation was inconclusive and unable to unequivocally declare if the pandemic resulted from a laboratory accident or human contact with an infected animal.

""All agencies assess that two hypotheses are plausible: natural exposure to an infected animal and a laboratory-associated incident,"" the report reads. Those were the same two hypotheses the U.S. intelligence community had ""coalesced around"" earlier this year before Biden asked agencies to conduct the most recent investigation.

What is the most important about this new review, even though it may not have settled the fundamental question of where the virus emerged, is the fact that intelligence agencies were able ""to reach broad agreement on several other key issues,"" including the judgment that ""the virus was not developed as a biological weapon"" and ""China's officials did not have foreknowledge of the virus before the initial outbreak of COVID-19 emerged – the two most outrageous and undignifying accusations leveled by the U.S. against Beijing.

It is also worth mentioning that while the joint WHO-China study of origins of SARS-CoV-2 published on March 30 concluded that the virus was most likely transmitted from bats to humans and that it was ""extremely unlikely"" that it escaped from the lab, a group of 13 U.S.-friendly countries raised concern over this investigation's independence, citing delays and a lack of full access to data."

1694,China urges U.S. to support int'l origins tracing cooperation,"A Foreign Ministry spokesperson on Monday said China hopes the United States will listen to the objective and rational voices of the international community and be a supporter rather than a saboteur of international cooperation in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic and the origins tracing of the coronavirus.

Spokesperson Wang Wenbin made the remark at a daily news briefing when asked to comment on recent remarks by Jeffrey Sachs, who heads the Lancet COVID-19 Commission.

Sachs said the global response to the pandemic has been wholly inadequate and one of the main geopolitical problems might have been the failure of the United States to work with China for global solutions. He also said ""the United States should learn some good manners to work cooperatively with China, rather than trying to impose its will on that nation.""

Wang told the press that a Swiss epidemiologist, Christian Althaus, had also said that China responded correctly to the pandemic and bought the rest of the world with one to two months to prepare.

Wang stressed that the COVID-19 response and studying its origins call for solidarity, cooperation and the spirit of science. However, some in the United States have time and again tried to politicize efforts on both fronts to deflect the blame for their own botched response.

""Such irresponsible behavior has not only cost the American people dearly, but also become the greatest obstacle in international cooperation in combating the virus and tracing the origins,"" Wang said.

""We hope that the United States can heed the objective and rational voice of the international community, seek solidarity instead of confrontation, take responsibility instead of resorting to blame-shifting, be guided by science instead of politics, and support international cooperation in fighting the virus and tracing the origins instead of disrupting relevant efforts,"" said the spokesperson."

""The United States and a fistful of its allies are trying to mislead the world,"" according to an op-ed by Md Enamul Hassan published in English-language newspaper Bangladesh Post on Wednesday.

""On August 27, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence of the U.S. released a summary of the intelligence community assessment on COVID-19 origins, which is the latest example of America's above sinister intentions,"" Hassan wrote.

The opinion article, which was titled ""The world should adopt scientific attitudes to COVID-19 origin-tracing,"" argued that the U.S. and its allies were determined to foil the scientific and rational approaches of origins-tracing of the virus at any cost.

""They don't care about precious human lives. Their reckless moves compel the world to believe that the U.S. is trying to hide something fishy that happened in its territory by thwarting scientific origin-tracing of the virus, which is a must for saving humanity from the pandemic,"" Hassan added, before urging the international community to adopt scientific attitudes to the origins-tracing of COVID-19.

""They have to ignore every visible and invisible pressure from the U.S., which is crucial to save humanity from the fatal disease and prevent more pandemics in the future,"" he wrote.

According to Hassan, the origins can be traced only by promoting early case search, molecular epidemiology, animal (intermediate) host introduction, and other origins-tracing studies in multiple countries and regions around the world.

The entire process has to be fully guided by scientific evidence and only can be done in a scientific, non-political way, he added.

For more than a year, the death of a San Jose woman named Patricia Dowd on February 6, 2020 was considered America's first COVID-19 death. But a 78-year-old woman, Lovell Brown from Kansas who died on January 9, 2020, has now been found to be the first COVID-19 death in the United States, The Mercury News reported on Thursday, citing data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention."

She stressed that such steps increased tensions in society and the international arena and impeded joint actions to counter the spread of the virus.

Russia has previously voiced its opposition to the politicization of COVID-19 origins tracing, Zakharova said.

""We consider it necessary to focus on finding ways in which we can develop international cooperation in fighting the pandemic, instead of using this global, human tragedy to settle scores at the interstate level and manipulate public opinion,"" she added."

In 1969, a teenager from Beijing joined 17 million Chinese students in the ""Down to the Countryside Movement,"" a campaign launched by Chairman Mao Zedong that asked urban youth to experience life by working in rural areas.



He traveled to a desolate village on the Loess Plateau in northwest China, and spent seven years living among its soft-dirt mountains and in its simple caves.



His name is Xi Jinping.



Liangjiahe, a then barren mountain village in Shaanxi Province, is now a prosperous place with modern agriculture and a booming tourism industry.

'Have meat and have it often'



Back then, life was harsh in Liangjiahe.



Xi lived in caves alongside the villagers and slept on a bed made of bricks and clay.



""People lived in poverty. They often went months without meat. What I wanted to do the most was to make it possible for the villagers not just to have meat sometimes, but to often have meat on their plates,"" said Xi, who is now Chinese president, general secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission.

After Xi became Party secretary of Liangjiahe Village in January 1974, he led villagers in a series of projects.



""These included the 'Educated Youth Dam,' the 'Educated Youth Well' – which remains the source of our tap water today – and later the iron mill, the supplies and sales office, the grain mill and the sewing workshop. These were only some of the good deeds he performed when he was Party secretary of Liangjiahe,"" recalled Shi Chunyang, former secretary of the CPC branch of Liangjiahe Village.



Xi decided that his top priority for the villagers would be food. He proposed improving the local soil conditions by building a dam, which would transform a large area of arid land into productive fields and improve crop yields.

A microcosm



Xi's plan to bring meat to villagers' tables has since come to fruition.



""In 1975, we saw some good results of the dam,"" Shi said. ""Firstly, the river bed could be used for farmland. Secondly, soil conditions improved, increasing yields from 1,500 kg per hectare to about 7,500 kg.""



Building on those foundations, Liangjiahe was gradually transformed over the following decades.



It has developed over 60 hectares of orchards on the mountains. It introduced photovoltaic facilities, developed aquaculture in the river and built vegetable greenhouses – and now tourism development is the focus of the village.

1700,China marks Lunar New Year with major victory in poverty alleviation,"01:01

Wednesday marks ""Lichun,"" the first solar term of the year, considered the beginning of spring. As a Chinese saying goes, ""the whole year's work depends on a good start in spring."" Chinese President Xi Jinping, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, on Wednesday visited Qianxi County in southwest China's Guizhou Province ahead of the Chinese New Year. February 12 signifies the beginning of the Chinese Lunar New Year. Various folk activities are held across the country to welcome the New Year. On the public square of Huawu Village in an ethnic Miao Township, Xi talked to villagers who were participating in festive activities, and extended his New Year's greetings to people of all ethnic groups across the country.

Experiencing local Miao culture

02:27

Roughly 10.9 percent of Guizhou's population are Miao, one of the largest ethnic minority groups in the country. To fully experience local culture, Xi later visited a manufacturing workshop for Miao embroidery in Huawu Village. ""It is also fashionable today,"" Xi told the workers present. ""It represents both the culture and industry.""

00:25

Miao are famed for their hand-made embroidery that goes back centuries. Even today, some people still weave their own cloth with dyes made with homemade indigo paste. The Chinese president also tried out wrapping huangba, a kind of yellow-colored sweet wrap made of rice that can be steamed or fried. Xi told his audience that he had never made a wrap that small before.

""[I wish you all] a happier and sweeter life,"" he said.

A model of poverty alleviation Guizhou, which used to be a provincial-level region with the biggest population of poor people, has lifted more than 9 million people out of poverty since 2012 with the gross domestic product (GDP) topping 1.78 trillion yuan ($276 billion) in 2020. On Wednesday afternoon, Xi visited Qianxi County, Bijie City where he inspected the ecological environment of a major tributary of the Wujiang River and visited local residents in Huawu Village.

The village is a case in point in the nation's massive poverty relief endeavor. It was lifted out of poverty in 2019. Bijie, tucked deep in the karst mountains of Guizhou, used to be one of China's most impoverished cities. Backed by the central government and other state organs, the city cultivated the land first, turning barren mountains into a luscious green. Then under the guidance of experts, villagers started to develop agriculture, breeding industry and rural tourism. Bijie has turned confrontation with nature into a win-win result and managed to rise above the poverty line. President Xi has called Bijie's success story ""a model of China's poverty alleviation drive.""

1701,China delists all remaining poverty-stricken counties,"The last nine poverty-stricken counties in southwest China's Guizhou Province have been officially removed from the poverty list, the provincial government announced on Monday. They were also the last remaining poverty-stricken counties in China. China has vowed to eradicate absolute poverty by 2020 – a major task in its drive to complete the building of a moderately prosperous society in all respects. At the end of 2019, 52 counties in the northwest, southwest and south of the country remained on the poverty list: nine in Yunnan Province, 10 in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, one in Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, seven in Sichuan Province, eight in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, eight in Gansu Province and nine in Guizhou Province.

Assessment by third-party agencies earlier this month showed that the poverty incidence in the nine counties in Guizhou decreased to zero percent and that the satisfaction rate among locals was over 99 percent, said Li Jian, director of the provincial poverty alleviation and development office, at a press briefing.



The average annual net income of impoverished people in these nine counties has risen to 11,487 yuan (about $1,740), well above the 4,000-yuan (about $609) national poverty line set this year, Li said.

A program to relocate poor rural residents has contributed significantly to Guizhou's success in poverty reduction. About 1.88 million people living in poor mountainous areas have been relocated to urban areas, according to provincial authorities. Various supporting measures have been taken to ensure that at least one person on average in each relocated household gets employed.



Meanwhile, the development of local specialty industries, such as vegetables, edible fungi and tea, has increased the income of rural residents."
1702,"China's fighting poverty, so why are the media so skeptical?","October 17 marks China's National Poverty Relief Day. This year is significant, as it's the year China vowed to eradicate extreme poverty in rural areas – a goal it says it's on track to meet, despite the chaos unleashed by COVID-19 earlier this year.

There's lots to celebrate. Over the past seven decades, China has lifted around 850 million people out of poverty, according to data from the World Bank, accounting for more than 70 percent of global poverty alleviation. In 2012, the number of impoverished people in rural areas was almost 99 million. By the end of 2019, that number fell to 5.5 million. In 2020, China's on the final stretch.

How has China managed to do it?

Different measures for different communities have helped: micro-loans, e-commerce, and access to education and healthcare. Millions of residents from rural areas have been moved to subsidized apartments with basic and modern facilities, something they couldn't afford before. Some of these moves have sparked controversy, but in the end, millions of people are living a healthier life with more opportunities than before.

Alleviating poverty in China is good news for China, of course. But it's also good news for the world. Ending poverty tops the 17 United Nations 2030 Sustainable Development Goals – a goal that's becoming more elusive given the COVID-19 crisis. But if eradicating poverty can be achieved in such a big, formerly impoverished country like China, there's hope that other countries can figure out a way to address poverty in a way that works for them.

But when you look at some media reports on China's efforts, what do you see? Skepticism over China's motivations, methods, and sustainability. Some of the points are justified – such a huge endeavor inevitably raises concerns. But sometimes it feels as if China just can't catch a break!

For example, a Financial Times article from June 26 reads: ""Inside China's race to beat poverty: Xi Jinping has vowed to eradicate extreme rural deprivation by the end of 2020. Will he meet his target?""

The article highlights the complexities of the task by interviewing people with different views. Some villagers have been given heavily subsidized apartments, it says, and that ""The villagers allocated these flats are happy to have them"" since ""On the mountain top, their earthen houses are exposed to the rain, as well as fatal rock slides.""

It also profiles people who aren't so happy – either because the Chinese government is doing too much by forcing people to move, or not doing enough, since many people who want to move don't meet the requirements. Those people say the ""local government has overlooked them.""

Fair enough, but sometimes it seems China can do no right. Yes, tackling poverty is a huge and imperfect undertaking, but you've got to start somewhere, right?

Some media also predicted COVID-19 would derail China's efforts to meet its 2020 goal. A CNN article from July 2, 2020 read, ""Ending poverty in 2020 was going to be Xi's crowning achievement. Coronavirus might have ruined it.""

Big dreams laid to waste is how the story appears framed here. The article says, ""This was supposed to be the year that Beijing would announce it had ended absolute poverty in China, fulfilling a key pledge of President Xi Jinping and one of the founding missions of the Chinese Communist Party. Then the novel coronavirus pandemic tore through the global economy.""

It's true that the pandemic has been excruciating for every country in the world, not just for China. And it's also true that the virus hit China very hard earlier this year. But just how much has COVID-19 changed China's goal? Judging by the current numbers, not much, if at all.

China's Q1 saw a 6.8% decline, yes. But by Q2, the GDP growth was already 3.2%, a sharp contrast to other Q2 economies around the world. China's Q3 is expected to be even stronger. In fact, the IMF said China will be the only major economy likely to grow this year, and predicted China's growth will accelerate to 8.2% in 2021.

In other words, yes, COVID threw a wrench into the works this year, but China's anti-poverty goals remain on track. That's something the whole world can celebrate this year.

1703,What are the institutional designs of China's poverty reduction drive?,"From relief-based poverty alleviation drive to development-oriented poverty alleviation program and then to targeted poverty alleviation, China has embarked on a distinctive development-oriented poverty alleviation path.

The goal of China's poverty reduction governance is to completely eliminate absolute poverty by the end of 2020. At the same time, China has actively carried out international exchanges and cooperation on poverty reduction to promote the global poverty reduction process.

Poverty alleviation is a critical task that runs through the 70-year development trajectory of China. The work from the early days of the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949 to 1978 was mainly relief-type poverty alleviation.

Since 1978 when China began to implement economic reform and opening-up policies, poverty alleviation has gone through the stage of systemic reform, during which large-scale development-oriented poverty relief drive was dominant. After the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC), poverty alleviation has entered the stage of targeted poverty alleviation.

At the first stage (1949-1978), the Chinese government availed of institutional reforms to solve widespread rural poverty. Through rural land reforms, the systemic obstacles to farmers' land ownership were eliminated, while the rural infrastructure was improved, with development of education and healthcare services going full steam ahead. Agricultural technology was widely promoted during the period, and a social security system was established.

In the interim, rural residents' living conditions were greatly improved, the total grain output surged by 169 percent, the infant mortality rate dropped by 75 percent, the life expectancy of the population extended by nearly 30 years, and the proportion of the rural population below survival levels plummeted by 50 percent.

The second is the stage (1978-2012) where development-type poverty alleviation was closely integrated with national strategies, and the outcomes of regional poverty governance became prominent. China has successively promulgated and implemented the Seven-Year Priority Poverty Reduction Program (1994-2000) and the Outline for Poverty Reduction and Development of China's Rural Areas (2001-2010), promulgating a development-oriented poverty alleviation policy.

It designated poverty-stricken counties and contiguous areas of extreme poverty, established a four-level poverty alleviation system from the central government to the county level, and formed a coordination mechanism in the fields of infrastructure construction, agriculture, water conservancy, transportation, power, and communications. At the national strategy level, it promoted planned and organized large-scale poverty alleviation actions.

Since the 18th CPC National Congress held in late 2012, China embraced a new era featuring targeted poverty alleviation. The central government solemnly pledged to eliminate absolute poverty across the country by 2020 and implemented targeted poverty alleviation, creating the best achievement in the history of poverty reduction in China. It has become a country with the most impressive poverty reduction record in the world.

In November 2013, Chinese President Xi Jinping put forward the idea of ""targeted"" or ""precision"" poverty alleviation for the first time in a poverty-stricken county in central China's Hunan Province, saying ""We should take targeted measures based on actual conditions and avoid empty slogans.""

""Targeted"" refers to personal concerns with supportive policies, including identification standards for the impoverished and customized plans and programs to lift everyone out of poverty. It first defines absolute poverty by using a standardized method of annual income. It also includes tests for proper healthcare, education, and sanitation.

A variety of methods for poverty alleviation are employed in light of specific scenarios: industry, creating a sustainable micro-business; relocating, moving people from remote areas; education and training; ecological compensation for those living in environmentally vulnerable areas; and social security, medical subsidies and direct payments to those who cannot work.

It is guaranteed that every impoverished family will receive timely help, and each village has full-time officials designated for taking specific measures. The secretaries of local party committees at the provincial, municipal, county, township, village levels coordinated their role to help the poor. In addition, in order to ensure the accuracy and authenticity of the poverty alleviation effect, third-party assessments will be conducted regularly and randomly.

As targeted poverty alleviation strategies came into practice in 2012, China has notched up the most impressive achievement in poverty reduction history, lifting some 90 million people in merely seven years and bringing down the incidence of poverty from 10.2 to 0.6 percent.

As of end-2018, 436 out of 832 poverty-stricken counties across the country had been lifted out of poverty, with the number of registered poverty-stricken villages plummeting from 128,000 to 26,000. When delivering the New Year's speech, President Xi noted another 340 poor counties got rid of poverty in 2019, or rather, more than 10 million people were lifted out of poverty.

Poverty governance has driven up the income of rural residents. In 2018, the per capita disposable income of rural residents in poverty-stricken areas reached to the tune of 10,371 yuan, 1.7 times that of 2013. The real income growth rate from 2013 through 2018 averaged 10 percent, which was 2.3 percentage points higher than the national rural average.

In 2018, the per capita disposable income of rural residents in poverty-stricken areas was equivalent to 71 percent of the national rural average, an increase of 8.9 percentage points from 2012, and its gap with the national rural average was further narrowed. In 2019, the per capita disposable income of rural residents in poverty-stricken areas settled on 11,567 yuan, a nominal increase of 11.5 percent over the previous year."
1704,China-ASEAN cooperation on poverty alleviation amid COVID-19,"For more than seven months, the pandemic has jeopardized the economic and social improvements humans have achieved in many decades, throwing billions of people into poverty. Among the impacted, Asian countries, with undeveloped social security systems and numerous informal workers, have borne the brunt of it.

Informal workers account for nearly 60 percent of non-farm employment in the Asia Pacific.

The pandemic may push 100 million more people into extreme poverty, almost half of whom live in South Asia, Beate Trankmann, UNDP China's country director said during the 2020 Extraordinary ASEAN-China Social Development and Poverty Reduction Forum on Wednesday.

She asserted that two-thirds of the sustainable development goals (SDGs) adopted in 2015 to improve people's lives by 2030 are now unlikely to be met, adding that vulnerable groups including the poor, small-scale farmers, women, children and disabled people are disproportionately affected by the pandemic.

Before the COVID-19 outbreak, ASEAN countries were applauded for their remarkable progress in poverty alleviation. The poverty rate in the member countries declined from 47 percent in 1990 to 15 percent in 2015, according to Kung Phoak, deputy secretary-general of the ASEAN Secretariat. He said at that pace, absolute poverty would have declined substantially and be eradicated in most ASEAN countries by 2030, but now the achievement is under risk.

With the pandemic costing trillions of dollars and leading to a global economic depression, it's unlikely to have enough money for many governments, especially those in underdeveloped countries, to banish poverty and inequality by 2030.

Data released by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) estimated that growth in the Southeast Asian region will decelerate to only one percent in 2020, which means many of those lifted out of absolute poverty would be at risk of falling back into poverty.

""In this difficult time, we must solidify cooperation and partnership. No country alone can effectively deal with the complexities of the pandemic and its adverse effects. Certainly, ASEAN stands ready to join hands with our partners, including China,"" Kung Phoak said during the virtual meeting."

In 2020, China has accomplished on schedule its poverty alleviation target for the new era, a significant victory that has impressed the world.



Through eight years of sustained work, China has lifted nearly 100 million poor people out of poverty, and all of its 832 poverty-stricken counties have been delisted.

Chinese President Xi Jinping, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission, has convened a series of meetings on poverty alleviation. Before every such meeting, he would visit impoverished regions to conduct research, learn about the local situation and hear opinions of grassroots officials and members of the public. Since 2012, Xi has set foot on 14 contiguous areas of dire poverty, featuring highly concentrated poverty and poor development conditions.

In 2016, when he visited a village in northwestern Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, Xi checked the shower facility in a villager's home, and was pleased to learn that the family had a solar water heater.



Recalling his early trips to some poor areas, Xi said his heart sank when he saw the bumpy and rugged roads, harsh living conditions of the locals and heard stories of children dropping out of school, or patients not getting treated in time.



""But when I went to poor villages in these few years, I saw substantial changes,"" Xi said at a March symposium. ""Seeing people's smiles, I am delighted.""



China readjusted its poverty line in 2011, raising it to 2,300 yuan ($352) annualy－an increase of 80 percent over 1,274 yuan ($195) from 2010. Since then, the standard has been raised annually taking into account inflation and other factors. The poverty line for 2020 is 4,000 yuan ($612).

China's poverty-eradication standard, in fact, cannot be defined by income numbers alone. Besides lifting the annual income, the country's basic poverty-eradication campaign also helps ensure that the poor have sufficient food and clothing, as well as access to compulsory education, basic medical services and safe housing."
1706,Eradicating extreme poverty in 2020: Did China set the bar too low?,"China wants to eliminate extreme poverty and build a moderately prosperous society in all respects by 2020.

The COVID-19 pandemic is estimated to push an additional 88 million to 115 million people into extreme poverty globally this year, with the total rising to as many as 150 million by 2021, depending on the severity of the economic contraction, according to the World Bank.

Despite this, China's anti-poverty goals remain on track. Besides the efforts made to battle against poverty over the past decades, the country's thorough epidemic prevention work also played a part in stabilizing a pandemic-hit economy earlier than the rest of the world.

Upon completion of the poverty eradication task this year, China will achieve the goals set in the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development 10 years ahead of schedule. This is of great significance to both China and the world, as no country in the world has ever lifted so many people out of poverty in such a short period of time, said Chinese President Xi Jinping at a symposium on securing a decisive victory in poverty alleviation earlier this year.

However, there are those that remain skeptical of the country's poverty alleviation work, arguing that China's poverty line is far below what is set by the World Bank."
1707,Third-party inspector of poverty relief work,"13:35

┃ ""I simply think I'm just doing something good."" ┃ Xuan Xuan, assessment team member Xuan Xuan, a 24-year-old graduate student from Lanzhou University, told CGTN her experience as a first-timer on the third-party assessment team in Zhenyuan County, northwest China's Gansu Province.

What is 'third-party assessment?'

Third-party assessment is a method to verify the authenticity of local assertions that a county is poverty-free. The assessment teams consist of people from all walks of life and use well-developed survey techniques. Their job is to go to the declared poverty-free areas and conduct multi-dimensional assessment and inspection work to ensure that there is no misevaluation, under-evaluation or the possibility of a return to poverty. Zhenyuan County declared itself poverty-free in October 2020. Located in the center of northwestern China, the area had a totally different scenario six years ago. The county is surrounded by the Loess Plateau and sits at an average elevation of 1,400 meters. Harsh environmental conditions restricted its economic and cultural development. According to data provided by the local government, around 17,000 people were living below the poverty line in 2014 – that number now stands at zero.

Eliminating absolute poverty also means the area has to accept supervision and inspection from all parties. On November 2, a team of 79 members like Xuan Xuan joined the five-day provincial third-party assessment. They were divided into eight groups and went to various townships in Zhenyuan County to conduct inspections. ""For many students, this is not the first time they've joined poverty alleviation work,"" Professor Chang Genying, who leads the assessment, told CGTN.

Are students qualified to do the job?

It is worth noting that the team members were mostly postgraduate and undergraduate students around the age of 24, majoring in different fields such as architecture, engineering and education. This seems to be different from our understanding of the usual investigation work for poverty alleviation as it requires very professional skills. Some questions were raised - Whether these students are qualified? How do they ensure the evaluation work is successfully carried out? And how can they guarantee its authenticity and accuracy?

┃“Who do they think are qualified to do this job other than university students then?” ┃ Yang Zeyi, assessment team member

""There is a long process before you can become an evaluator. We have to go through a lot of training and exams to get qualified,"" Yang Zeyi added.

""I've done this job more than five times now. You have to take part in the training before you start this job properly,"" Wang Xuyang, an experienced team leader, said, explaining to CGTN the training details. ""We attended the training in a huge classroom and the participants all came to the training voluntarily. Our professor would explain to us what poverty alleviation is, the specific detail of the government's poverty alleviation policy, and how to communicate with farmers. Because the causes of poverty vary from place to place, the adopted strategies also need to be different to ensure that we can obtain the most accurate data possible.”

Students who finish the training have to take an online exam. ""The exam covers every detail of the policy, and even includes the barriers faced when communicating with locals,"" Wang Xuyang added.

What is the workflow?

According to the third-party assessment requirements, the team needs to have a complete workflow.

The assessment team members randomly select the towns and villages to be spot-checked before departure. And based on the population data of the previous local census, the priority is to select the absolutely poor households that have been registered for verification. The members will then visit the farmers' homes, communicate with them in depth to understand their production and living conditions, income situation, and inspect the family's basic livelihood security such as housing, food and drinking water safety.

In order to ensure the standardization and consistency of the evaluation outcomes, the team adopted a unified measurement standard that was implemented based on a mobile application called ""Targeted Poverty Alleviation"" throughout out the entire field visit.

""Our questionnaires are formed from the app. Based on the poverty alleviation standards set by the country, we ask the interviewees questions as well as check the relevant materials, including bank statements, deposit and withdrawal details, housing appraisal certificates, etc. to check that the corresponding indicators such as income and housing meet the standards,"" Wang Xuyang emphasized. ""In the entire investigation process, local officials are absolutely not allowed to interfere or participate.""

In addition, the team is also responsible for assessing local officials' jobs. By chatting with the farmers and asking them questions, the team will then determine whether the corresponding village support cadres regularly visit the farmer households to understand their situation, whether they have helped the farmers solve problems, and if the cadres are disciplined. The group leaders will also examine the effectiveness of the village cadres' work by conducting one-to-one conversations with them to check their mastery of the area under their jurisdiction as well as their understanding of specific issues and details of the farmers.

After the daily on-site inspections, the third-party assessment team members have to collect and audit the statistics. They will have to conduct a second investigation if there is doubtful content and only upload to the evaluation system after ensuring that the information is correct. They will report verified issues to the relevant departments so that the farmers can get as much help as possible.

What are the challenges?

Technically, data normalization problems could be solved based on the unified questionnaire as well as the in-depth training for the assessment members. However, it is another obstacle that needs to be resolved when it comes to the authenticity of the result.

┃""The hardest part wasn't asking them questions. It's the communication with the farmers."" ┃ Xuan Xuan, assessment team member

Human communication is something that can't be normalized or replaced by any tool. In China, where numerous accents and dialects exist, communicating with farmers who had strong northwestern accents had no doubt become a challenge for the team members who are from all over China.

""I could understand very little at the beginning. I had to ask them to repeat themselves over and over again to understand what they were saying,"" Xuan Xuan said, explaining the problem she faced as a native of central China's Henan Province. As the work progressed, she became more familiar with the dialect and local accent. ""I could understand more later on,"" she added.

However, the dialect and accent weren't the only communication problem. The difficulty farmers had expressing themselves was more of a barrier. Most of the absolute poverty is caused by objective reasons such as disabilities or diseases, which made it impossible for the people to receive education, hence their limited ability to express themselves. ""We have to listen carefully to what they want to say and then ask questions based on the details from their response. We can't miss a single detail,"" Yang Zeyi said.

""Some farmers tend to hide what they have from us,"" Wang Xuyang said. Thanks to China's targeted poverty alleviation actions, many poor households benefit from direct economic subsidies and some of them had already gotten out of poverty with the policy dividend. However, ""they may be unwilling to reveal their extra assets to us for some reason,"" Wang pointed out, and one farmer ""would not say anything without us asking. This will directly lead to the distortion of the data we collect.""

Inaccurate statistics will have a big impact on the subsequent poverty alleviation work. In order to solve this problem, the evaluators from the assessment team will communicate with the village and township officials regarding the interviewed household's property-related issues. They will then investigate whether the family has joined the relevant organizations and institutions that help them obtain income and whether the household has received the due funds so as to finally determine whether it reaches economic indicators of poverty alleviation.

What is the assessment for?

Poverty is the biggest obstacle to the realization of human rights. Alleviating poverty can effectively promote the realization of the right to development for the poor. In order to achieve this goal, there is still a lot more that needs to be done.

""Poverty alleviation is to help people stand on their feet. But growing taller requires people to put in the effort. I think that lifting people out of poverty is just a target, but the real goal lies in the hands of people,"" Xuan Xuan said with a sigh.

""We must look at this issue from a third-party objective perspective, not just listen to whatever the (local) government says. [You need to have] a more comprehensive understanding, which is actually a guarantee as a whole for our country,"" Yang Zeyi told CGTN, regarding the current poverty alleviation work at the grassroots level in China.

According to data provided by the State Council Leading Group Office of Poverty Alleviation and Development, a total of 531 counties with more than 3,200 villages and 116,000 households were surveyed on the spot as of the end of December 2020."
1708,Checking the finishing touches to anti-poverty work in rural China,"36:30

The first time I visited Kuijiu in October 2019, the alpine village in southwest China's Sichuan Province seemed like a worst-case scenario for anyone taking on poverty. A lot was going against it: a godforsaken location, barren lands that barely provided sustenance for the residents and a population in extreme poverty. But the future, uncertain as it was, promised a respite. China had vowed that extreme poverty in the countryside would be history by the end of 2020, and last September I was back in town to see if villagers would pull through in time. The transformation of Kuijiu could be felt from miles away. Setting out from our hotel in Butuo, the closest county to the village, I buckled up for the almost hour-long journey I've come to dread during my first visit. I visualized the route in my head. We'll cruise down a highway before a nondescript turn takes us off the road and onto vertiginous paths of dirt and gravel. The car will shake violently before stopping so we could finish the last stretch on foot. I was as ready as I'll ever be.

Kuijiu is hemmed in by mountains. The scenery is breathtaking, but everyday life is harsh. /CGTN Kuijiu is hemmed in by mountains. The scenery is breathtaking, but everyday life is harsh. /CGTN

But that day, our driver pulled over a few streets away from the hotel. My producer pointed to a parked bus, and her gesture was enough to put a smile on my face. Kuijiu can now be reached via a paved road. To be sure, the bus ride was not bump-free but the anticipation masked any discomfort. Passengers, with bags and cartons overflowing with produce, got off one after another until I and the filming crew were the only ones left. Kuijiu was the last stop on the bus route and there, I reunited with familiar faces. Shen Rui, a resident poverty alleviation official who showed me the ropes last time I was here, seemed to be a shell of his previous buoyant self. He had shed some weight but wasn't any less energetic than before. Yang Bo, an older team member who introduced me and the villagers to the seven-step handwashing technique well before COVID-19 popularized it, was also looking thinner, but surprisingly younger, than when I last saw him.

It was very obvious that stress from the job had taken its toll on these men. They were just weeks away from the self-imposed deadline, and it was only a matter of time before inspectors arrived – some announced, some not. There was no room for mistakes, and even though the bulk of the work had been done, tying up loose ends was still a mammoth task. A household needed to meet a long list of criteria before it is officially crossed off the poverty list. The requirements touched different aspects of life – finances, accommodation, basic amenities, living conditions, and a lot more. Plumbing problems, roof cracks, even TVs without cable could land Rui and his colleagues in serious trouble when auditors arrive for assessment. My visit couldn't have come at a worse time, but they were happy to have me. The first order of business was to check a new resettlement community on the mountaintop.

These new houses were built as part of the country's poverty alleviation project in Kuijiu.

Still under construction when I was in town in late 2019, the houses have since been finalized and furnished. A stone's throw away from the shaky sheds with earthen floors and thatched roofs that residents once called home, the new dwellings were nevertheless light-years away in design, comfort, and safety. The alterations, cosmetic as they may seem, spell possibilities and opportunities. The new road breaks the isolation factor and helps this village lost in time make its leap into modernity. Farmers can now sell any surplus in the county's markets, students have fewer excuses to skip school and sick people no longer have to put off going to the doctor because of inconvenient transportation. I also thought of the new houses as a chance to start afresh. Some families were already hard at work to settle in and make the space their own. One was building an overhang atop the front gate of their courtyard, another had decorated the walls with posters and stickers, and a few were installing TV satellite dishes. But as we hopped from one house to another, it became clear that the pretty façade hid some flaws – malfunctioning light switches, wonky door locks, loose window frames. Water was also out and we later discovered a leaking pipe was to blame.

Rui was uncomfortable, but not for the reasons I had expected. He didn't mind dealing with the extra work. A phone call to technicians would make these problems disappear in no time. If need be, he was willing to roll up his sleeves and do the repairs himself, and indeed we ended up changing the defective hoses ourselves. What frustrated him was the reluctance of the new homeowners to deal with the smaller issues on their own, or at least actively ask for help from Rui or his team instead of sitting tight. They had been holding the hands of villagers for years now, and it was soon time to let go. Rui needed to know that locals will be able to pick up where the team had left after they left, but seeing many still lacked initiative put him in a bad mood. ""What will happen when we're gone?"" he said in a defeated tone. My tongue was tied, and I couldn't help but wonder just how long he'd been choking on this fear before he finally spat it out. The question kept playing over and over in my head, but the tasks at hand were a good distraction. A couple of students were ditching class and needed an intervention. A widowed mother of two was resisting moving into her new home because it had no space for her pigs and chickens and sought assurance that leaving them behind will not be a costly mistake. Her neighbors, an elderly couple, required assistance in dealing with a clogged floor drain that filled their kitchen with a stench every time they turned on the faucet. At the headquarters, the poverty relief team was busy crunching numbers, going over villagers' finances and cross checking medical reimbursement forms.

Plenty in Kuijiu boggled me. Children without parents raising themselves. Young adults choosing to work in the fields over plowing through a book. Toddlers putting in their mouth whatever scrap they dug out of dirt under the watch of their mothers. And the collective calm, bordering on nonchalance, in the face of water outage. Being alone with my thoughts felt overbearing, even more so frustrating. It seemed impossible to understand what my eyes were registering without falling into the trap of passing judgement, making assumptions or rushing into hasty conclusions. Most nights ended with a brain freeze and a sense of malaise that seeped into my patchy sleep. I was struggling to make sense of a reality that wasn't mine, but so were the villagers. A life of scarcity was all they knew and this new world with paved roads, safe roofs and children going to class is foreign and strange and has yet to sink in.

Surrounded by sprawling coconut plantations and pristine beaches, life in Longlou, a township of Wenchang City in southern China's island province of Hainan, is slow and quiet. In the last 10 years, things have started to change in Longlou, home to the Wenchang Spacecraft Launch Site. Since 2009, this sleepy town comes to life when tourists and space enthusiasts throng along nearby beaches to watch rockets blast off.

A few kilometers from the launch site, local farmers in Honghai Village of Longlou have found a way to cash in on their hometown's newfound fame with the one thing it has always been famous for – coconuts. Before China's space program put Wenchang on the map, it was known as the ""home of coconuts"" with a rich culture centered on the tropical fruit, which grows abundantly in the area. At the Honghai Coconut Carving Farmers' Co-op, a small workshop converted from an abandoned farmhouse, local artist Wang Feihai has been leading a group of some 30 villagers to make traditional handicrafts out of coconut wood and shells, known as coconut carvings.

The co-op was the brainchild of Zhu Hongwen, the team leader of rural work in Honghai Village. When he arrived in 2019, Zhu quickly noticed a disconnect between Longlou's booming tourism and the rural community. ""Many farmers stopped working after their lands were expropriated for construction. People here would even make jokes about girls marrying into the village because it is poor,"" he told CGTN. Most of the villagers are left-behind seniors, who don't have other skills or education to get employed elsewhere, Zhu said. After thoroughly surveying the village, he took a keen interest in coconut carving. ""Coconut carving is characteristic of Wenchang and eco-friendly. The idea is to help the farmers benefit from space tourism and earn a living at their doorsteps,"" Zhu said. With help from local artisans, the coconut carving co-op came into being in December 2019. From its conception, the initiative has been met with doubts and resistance from some old-fashioned local officials, who don't see the point in such a time-consuming endeavor. ""They think that after I leave the village in a few years, no one will care,"" Zhu said. But Hu Hele, Party secretary of the village committee, took Zhu's side. ""It is flexible work which the farmers can do in their free time,"" Hu said, pointing at two women at work, who had been polishing some lampshades. Both women are from low-income families, and now they each can earn at least 1,000 yuan more a month after joining the co-op, Hu told CGTN. Besides this, Hu believes this time-honored craft is something the villagers will easily warm to because of their natural affinity with coconuts. ""Coconut is our culture. We want to promote our culture,"" he said.

With a history of more than 1,000 years, coconut carving is a treasured heritage in Wenchang. In 2008, Hainan coconut carving was listed an intangible cultural heritage in China. At the Wenchang Coconut Carving Exhibition Center, exquisite works from renowned artisan Fu Shiqiong, the province's only inheritor of the artistry, are on display for visitors to learn about the natives' love for all things coconut. Fu's proteges, a handful in number including Wang Feihai, have been on a mission to pass down the skills. Wang returned to the village in 2010 after living over 20 years in southern China's Guangdong Province, where he attended art school. After Wenchang became synonymous with China's aerospace city, Wang saw the opportunity of a lifetime to be a part of his hometown's development.

""We hope to use this handicraft to contribute to the rural economy. In this way, we can put our craft to good use,"" Wang said, painstakingly adding the finishing touch to a souvenir through a pair of reading glasses. The co-op has so far organized three training sessions for beginners, while experienced artists draw up some simple designs that ordinary villagers can try their hands at. The cut-out lamps Wang designed have been a success story, after a Thailand-based client saw the samples via Zhu's Douyin account and reached out for a purchase. Encouraged by their first overseas order, Zhu has enlisted the help of social media-savvy college students, who visit the village regularly to promote local products via livestreaming. Wang, on the other hand, is not too excited about the exposure just yet. The artist is adamant that every carving is entirely handmade, and worried that too much too soon could result in lower quality.

1710,Documentary | The Battle Up The Hill,"Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture, where Butuo is located, has also been ravaged by two epidemics – drugs and HIV. Further stacking the odds against this region is the slave system that the indigenous Yi ethnic group had adopted, and which was only abolished in the late 1950s.

Poverty has dogged this place for longer than locals have been alive – the result of a catastrophic marriage between a fragile environment, geographical remoteness, tardy development, marginalization, and socio-economic backwardness.

If an answer were to exist anywhere, it would be in Butuo, a county in the hinterland of southwest China defined by its past, struggling with its present and betting on a brighter future.

Can a place that knew nothing but need and deprivation for generations have what it takes to prosper?

Decades of an anti-poverty campaign by the central Chinese government have lifted more people nationwide out of poverty than any other country and helped hundreds of millions stand on their feet amid an infrastructure boom, industrialization push, and generous subsidies. Butuo, however, was an exception. Progress has been slow and poverty stubborn and persistent.

Some 36,000 people rose over the poverty line between 2015 when the country adopted a targeted approach to poverty reduction, and 2019. And with just one year before China's self-imposed deadline to eradicate absolute poverty by the end of 2020, 80,485 residents were still classified as poverty-stricken in the county, according to official data. There, the poverty incidence rate stood at 36.5 percent, more than anywhere else in the prefecture.

As a 2013 official list of 832 impoverished counties slowly shrank, the name of Butuo persisted until there were only seven left province-wide and 52 on the national level.

The complex nature of poverty in the county has complicated efforts to find a way out of the predicament.

In Butuo, 90 percent of the population is engaged in farming but because of limited technology and sales channels, productivity is low and farmers struggle to make ends meet. The industrial sector leaves much to be desired and tourism, a pillar of the local economy, is subject to seasonal fluctuations.

With few opportunities at home, the majority of the working-age population has long looked further afield for much-needed income, making Butuo a prime exporter of laborers, mostly unskilled and with little to no education. The county's labor force stands at about 90,000, official figures show, of whom migrant workers account for 61,000 or 67.8% of the total.

Venturing out to big cities helps reduce financial stress and contributes 53 percent of Butuo's GDP but it strains family ties as children are often left in the custody of grandparents or even to fend for themselves – and this creates new problems that jeopardize achievements in poverty reduction.

Left-behind children are some of the most vulnerable groups in China, forced to face life's hardships from a young age. Research shows they're at a disadvantage educationally, failing to keep up in class and inclined to drop out of school. That's bad news for a county with high illiteracy levels and teacher turnover rates. The good news is that more attention is being paid to improving education through policy, facility enhancements, incentives and advocacy.

Health care has been another focus of the local poverty relief efforts, with an army of village doctors making house calls to check on the elderly, HIV patients, pregnant women and newborn babies and helping locals shake off a longstanding tradition of relying on spiritual healers for treatment.

In November 2020, Butuo was declared free of absolute poverty after meeting a set of established criteria. The feat is not the end game, but rather an important milestone on a longer journey."
1711,Baji Quan: Extending one's full potential to the eight extremities,"Baji Quan involves stretching out. The concept relies on applying one's head, shoulder, elbow, hand, bottom, crotch, knee and foot at once. It is manifested by ""knocking the heaven down with a shoulder-shaking"" strike, which extends one's full potential to the eight extremities. That's the origin of ""Baji"" (eight extremities)."

1713,Clubs in Tanzania promoting Kung Fu,"In the downtown area of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania's commercial capital, Saidi Mfaume, dressed in white attire, was leading people in practicing Kung Fu (Chinese martial arts).

""Kung Fu is not only an entertainment,"" beamed the 35-year-old Tanzanian Kung Fu teacher.

Mfaume, father of a two-year-old daughter, who owns Shaolin Temple Tanzania Kung Fu Club in Dar es Salaam, trained in China's Shaolin Temple in Henan province for three months in 2013 under the sponsorship of the Chinese government.

The Kung Fu teacher said in 2014 the Chinese government offered him another scholarship for a short course training on Chinese culture which helped him fully engage himself in promoting Kung Fu across Tanzania.

Mfaume said cultural exchanges between China and Tanzania are a golden opportunity, and Tanzania stands to learn a lot from China's advanced technology and development.

""With Kung Fu training, doors to a bright future are open. What we need to do is to train our young men,"" said the teacher.

At the very beginning, Mfaume felt that there was still slow response in Kung Fu training in the country because a section of the population thought that Kung Fu is connected to criminality, which is completely wrong.

With the spread of Kung Fu education, public awareness is changing. ""People now believe that Kung Fu is a good martial art intended to discipline and to protect our youth from various dangerous situations,"" he added.

According to him, he has trained over 1,000 people after he had opened Kung Fu clubs in several regions in Tanzania, including Tanga, Lindi, Dodoma, and Mbeya.

He said, movie makers across the world are looking for good Kung Fu trainees like the ones he is grooming in Tanzania.

""Kung Fu can create employment by performing in action movies. One can become a super star through acting in a movie,"" said Mfaume.

Hamad Abdallah is one of the Kung Fu trainees at the club. He learned about Shaolin Temple through social media.

""Since I started cultivating interest in Kung Fu from when I was a child, I decided to join the Shaolin Temple (Tanzania Kung Fu Club) and my family supported me to join the training,"" said the 18-year-old student from Makongo Juu Secondary School in Dar es Salaam.

""Kung Fu has improved my health. It has inculcated discipline in me and it has also improved my self-defense,"" said Abdallah.

""I have trained for two years now and my focus is to become a Kung Fu super star and become a world renowned actor,"" said the student as he joined his evening training.

He said he is looking forward to visiting China, adding that he is also looking forward to participating in international Kung Fu competitions."

1715,Mantis Fist: Routines in martial arts reflect the philosophy of life,"05:07

Mantis Fist is one of the four famous fists from east China's Shandong Province. This treasured Chinese martial arts technique dates back to the end of the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644). It belongs to the category of pictographic fists. Legend has it that a man named Wang Lang based the technique on the moves of a mantis hunting cicadas. It has no blocking position and all the moves are offensive.

This technique embodies the strengths of many martial arts schools in the late Ming and early Qing dynasties. It focuses on the element of offense as opposed to pliability in those techniques. Xu Xueli is the eighth-generation inheritor of the Mantis Fist. He started practicing the technique at age of 7 and entered the provincial team at 16. At 31, he became a martial arts coach. He has dedicated his entire life to martial arts. At the age of 78, he feels he still has much to achieve. ""I think the martial art is worth being learned and studied for a lifetime,"" Xu said.

During his 70 years of practice, Xu has researched a lot on fist routines while improving his skills. Mantis has a long dorsum. The practitioners need to work on making their waist flexible and their back stretchable to a certain point. In addition, the moves are rapid. The idea is to exploit the opponent's weak spot, and if there isn't any, break the defense.

""During the battle, if I see room, I go through and attack. If there isn't any, I have to go directly and break through the defense,"" Xu said. The style, in general, is about rapid attacks and getting into a brave momentum. For Xu, it is not only a kungfu technique, but also part of science and culture. As a martial arts coach, he has the responsibility to pass on the traditional values. He wants to give his students the real deal – teach them all he's got.

1716,Huaquan Fist: Great strength generates explosive force,"07:30

One person with great strength can defeat ten who're skilled. Use tricks to win wisely. This is the essential message of Huaquan Fist. Great strength generates explosive force. Wang Yuanxiang was born into a martial art family in Cangzhou City, North China's Hebei Province. His family has been practicing and teaching Huaquan Fist since the time of Qing Dynasty (1636-1912). Having practiced the skill since childhood, Wang is now a fifth-generation inheritor of Huaquan Fist.

There is a set of similar techniques, called Zhaquan Fist. Legend has it that after the An-Shi Rebellion in the Tang Dynasty (618-907) was quelled, the patriotic generals and soldiers stayed in ancient Cangzhou and founded the Zhahua school. Zha Shangyi and Hua Zongqi were fellow apprentices of the same master. Zha and his disciples practiced Zhaquan Fist, while Hua and his disciples practiced Huaquan Fist.

Many of their moves are very similar, therefore the two are inseparable. The close relationship is also Wang's expectation of martial arts. He named his martial art club Tuanjie (solidarity) Club. In his opinion, martial arts are a kind of culture. He is of the view that all kung fu schools should unite and inherit Chinese martial arts jointly. No matter what school, fist or nation you identify with, ""we need mutual respect and communication; this is my hope.""

To achieve his wish, Wang has kept practicing and reviewing fist formulas for decades. He practices with a wooden dummy, thousand pounder, hard slate, broomstick, stone padlock and traditional dunzi (a stump or stone) to increase his strength.

In all the martial art skills, speed prevails. It is essential in practicing Huaquan. ""The word 'hua' in 'Huaquan' also means to move fast and neutralize the enemy's strength and then attack again,"" says Wang. During a prolonged practice, Wang perfected his skills, as well as his systematic and profound understanding of the fist.

There are four different styles of the fist, with less jumping but more hand positions. One uses both hands and feet, emphasizing hand, eye, body and step coordination. There are also many kinds of steps, like swooping, rounding, leaping and skipping. Beyond that, martial arts contains the principle of dealing with the world. Wang always believes that no matter the reason is for learning martial arts, one must adhere to the virtues and use the genre in the right way.

""I am over 70 years old. Conscience always comes first in martial art practice and before anything else,"" says Wang. Wang's granddaughter practices with him as the seventh generation of the family. It has been hundreds of years since the foundation of Huaquan Fist. It is the persistence of countless practitioners that allows Chinese martial arts to be passed down through generations."
1717,Miaodao saber: An important cold weapon from ancient battlefields,"08:01

The miaodao saber, also known as ""long saber"" in ancient times, gets its name from the slender shape of a seedling. It is a precious cultural legacy of China. Miaodao can be used both as a blade and a spear, with one or both hands. In actual combats, the weapon is mainly aimed at the opponent's upper body, like the head, shoulders, arms or chest.

It has been recognized as an intangible cultural heritage of China. Originating in the Han Dynasty (202BC-220AD) and having reached its peak in the Tang Dynasty (618-907), miaodao has a history of more than a thousand years. The weapon's shape determines the fighting technique. The back of the thick blade is used to fend off the enemy's weapon. The tip is pretty straight and suitable for stabbing. Miaodao can't be easily fractured like a regular sword. With the advent of cavalries, it became an essential cold weapon in ancient battlefields.

The miaodao saber could be used single-handedly or with both hands. /CGTN The miaodao saber could be used single-handedly or with both hands. /CGTN

With only a few written records, miaodao techniques have been passed down by word of mouth for a long time. Located in north China's Hebei Province, Cangzhou City is known as the hometown of Chinese martial arts. Martial arts have been a part of local traditions for hundreds of years. Many techniques and weapons, including miaodao, have been passed down among these people. Born into a martial arts family, Guo Guide began practicing with his father Guo Ruixiang when he was still a kid. As a representative inheritor of miaodao, he has some unique views on its techniques.

Hacking, lifting, cutting, and stabbing: the moves of miaodao integrate the Tongbi Fist's footwork, which is pretty flexible. According to Guo Guide, when you wield the saber, the back and the blade must be on the same track. Holding it with both hands helps release the arm's strength.

In addition to studying miaodao techniques, Guo is committed to inheriting his ancestors' legacy and editing written records for the next generations. In the 1970s, there weren't any document about the origin of miaodao. Guo's father went around doing verification to prove that it is a precious cultural heritage of China. ""My strongest recollection of my father in his late years is that he had dim eyesight, wearing glasses and a cotton-padded jacket on the shoulders. He got up at four or five o'clock every day and started writing about miaodao. He left dozens of notebooks with dense handwriting, including many of his own research results,"" Guo recalls.

Originating in Mount Emei, a sacred mountain situated in southwest China's Sichuan Province, Emei is one of the three traditional martial arts schools in China. Known for its unique style with many branches, it features a variety of fists; among them, the Sword Fist. It was created by a monk from western Sichuan in 1860. The technique has been passed on with special characteristics for more than 150 year.

Sword Fist, as the name suggests, mainly includes finger movements to attack like a sword. Compared to other fist styles, it combines the finger movements of Chinese qigong and the flexible characteristics of Sichuan martial arts. It is characterized by quick eyes and hands and accurate pointing of fingers with great force.

As some would say: ""Getting punched might feel better than being poked."" Emei Sword Fist gathers the entire strength of your body on your fingers – the reason why it bursts into such great power. The combination of fist, palm and hook positions can do great damage to attacked vital points or exposed parts of the human body.

""One finger resembles the spear, poking the weak spots of the body. Two fingers resemble a sword with great power. Three fingers resemble the claw, hooking the vital parts of your body. Four fingers usually form the palm. Hacking, stabbing, rubbing and chopping. Five fingers make claws, aiming at your eyes, throat, even your heart,"" said Li. Boasting a long history, Emei Sword Fist has a profound cultural background. But with the rapid development of human society, it also faces the threat of being lost like some other traditional treasures. Sadly, not many people practice this martial art form today.

1719,Emei 24 close-range combat techniques,"05:36

As one of the three major schools of Chinese traditional martial arts, Emei martial arts originated around Mount Emei and became popular in southwest China's Sichuan Province. With regional features of various mountains and rivers, ancient practitioners tried to make up for the short stature of residents by seeking out the most effective fighting skills. Over time, a kind of special martial arts was formed to help the weak overcome the strong.

There is a traditional branch named Emei 24 Close-range Combat Techniques, which belongs to the School of Counteraction, one of the eight main schools of Emei martial arts. The ""24"" means there are 24 kinds of moves that are used. With agile and fierce moves, Wu Xinliang is already in his 60s. He has been practicing for more than 40 years, during which time he has won many national competitions and become a representative Emei figure.

The 24 Close-range Combat Techniques emphasize counteraction with a single hand. It's about reacting skillfully using the palms and fingers first. Wu thinks that the essence lies in actual combat. The trick is all about diversion. One can use smart tricks to lure the opponent into a trap, then make the next move. In other words, one can overcome stronger opponents by taking advantage of their own strengths and avoid their weaknesses.

Emei martial arts was formed to help the weak overcome the strong. /CGTN Photo Emei martial arts was formed to help the weak overcome the strong. /CGTN Photo

In addition to practicing, Wu devotes himself to the legacy of Emei martial arts and constantly explores new paths of development. In 1986, China initiated the Sanshou competition. Wu volunteered to form the Sichuan Sanshou Team. After the first round, however, his team was almost wiped out. ""That kind of intense movement was pretty much like anaerobic exercise. We were exhausted entering the second round,"" says Wu.

He found that endurance and stamina could be key points in the Sanshou competition. It occurred to him that there is a kung fu style in Sichuan called ""Xiaojindan"" that could help to regulate breathing for practitioners. ""Contract the abs during intense exercises, and press the extra air out of the body in an instant. Fresh air will flow into your gut. Whenever I feel tired, I'd practice this technique. Then I would not get tired easily,"" says Wu.

The song of the fist goes: The chivalry fist starts in an exceptional way, with cross punches to protect both sides. The upward punch is a crucial mainstay, while keeping the central position defended. Push the elbow into the chest, turn the palms as fast as wind. Like wielding the sword without rest… One arm thrusts into the sea, with various tricks hidden in the sleeve.

These vigorous and powerful moves come from the Red Fist, one of the mainstream local fists in northwest China's Shaanxi Province.

Originating in the Zhou and Qin dynasties (770B.C.-207 B.C.), Red Fist is widespread in the Guanzhong area in Shaanxi. It plays an important role in traditional Chinese martial arts. Through the collection and arrangement by generations of inheritors, it has formed a system with rich content, various routines and comprehensive techniques. It is well-known for professional excellence and moral integrity.

Originating in the Zhou and Qin Dynasties, Red Fist is widely spread in the Guanzhong area of Shaanxi Province. /CGTN Photo Originating in the Zhou and Qin Dynasties, Red Fist is widely spread in the Guanzhong area of Shaanxi Province. /CGTN Photo

The ""red"" in the name implies that the fist is bloody and lethal, with blade-like moves inspired by the ancient battlefield. Later in the Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368), it developed into a barehanded martial art due to the ban of weapons. Nonetheless, the moves are still lethal. The Red Fist also has unique cultural characteristics, and is the essence of Shaanxi martial arts culture. As the chairman of the Shaanxi HongQuan (Red Fist) Culture Research Association, Shao Zhiyong has been committed to the promotion of Red Fist. In his view, the fist focuses on the balance between inner and outer strengths. It is for both good health and competition.

""I began to practice the Red Fist to be stronger in my childhood. I went on to do that for nearly six decades and it does help a lot,"" said Shao. During the practice, one should study skills and understand the cultural connotations. Before accepting a disciple, the master examines their moral character and behaviors to see if they are qualified. ""Learn the rituals before going to the master. Know the morals before practicing the fist. We practice not to bully, but for justice, confidence and self-improvement,"" said Shao.

The practice cultivates the body and morals. It demands chivalry as well as politeness. It is not only the moves, but also the spirit that make Red Fist unfailing. In 2008, Red Fist was listed as a national intangible cultural heritage. As a representative inheritor, in his decades of practicing, Shao has always been diligent in teaching and promoting the fist. With this unremitting spirit, he has been contributing to the revitalization of traditional martial arts and the promotion of national cultures."
1721,Wing Chun: One of the traditional southern fists styles,"06:50

Created in the Southern Shaolin Temple in southeast China's Fujian Province, Wing Chun is one of the traditional southern fists styles. Legend has it that Wing Chun was created by female Master Wumei in the late Ming and early Qing dynasties. Her pupils then promoted it in Hong Kong and around the world.

When talking about Chinese martial arts, it is said that ""Shaolin is in the north and Wing Chun in the south."" Wing Chun is a technique used to stop attacks. It uses the principles of human mechanics, lever structure and triangle mechanics to attack the opponent's weakness. The goal is to defeat the strong as soon as possible. For many people, Wing Chun is based in the “muk yan chong,” the wooden dummy, but the essence of this practice is far from that. As an eighth-generation Wing Chun inheritor, Zheng Zujie thinks that Wing Chun has a deep, profound meaning.

Zheng Zujie is an eighth-generation Wing Chun inheritor. /CGTN Photo Zheng Zujie is an eighth-generation Wing Chun inheritor. /CGTN Photo

Great wisdom in small ideas

Different from other fists with complicated branches, Wing Chun only has three sets of moves: “siu nim tau” (little idea), “cham kiu” (seeking arm) and “biu tze” (shooting fingers). The “siu nim tau” comes from Zen and is based on the philosophy of cleansing the thoughts and truly understand yourself. It is the basic technique of Wing Chun. Developing a strong character is more important during training. ""Once you calm down in peace, you can focus more on what you're doing,"" says Zheng.

Using a short punch to beat a strong enemy

Why does the Wing Chun win when it comes to speed? The secret is to punch forward right in front of you. And there is no accumulation of strength. But how can one exhibit great strength in the shortest distance? As an old saying goes: The power is generated by the muscles and unleashed with the bones. The answer is a power push. Wing Chun is a combination of short moves like punches, fingers, wrists, elbows, and torso. By gathering all the strength, the power in those moves is concentrated.

By gathering all the strength, the power in Wing Chun moves is concentrated. /CGTN Photo By gathering all the strength, the power in Wing Chun moves is concentrated. /CGTN Photo

Protect the centerline as well as moral principles

Vital body parts such as the eyes, nose, throat, abdomen, and genitals are almost all on the centerline. Wing Chun moves are aimed at protecting these organs. Thus it is called ""Protecting the centerline."" In fact, there's a hidden meaning in this idea. As a practitioner of Wing Chun, one must defend the bottom line; they must remain faithful to the principles and morals of martial arts.

""Protecting the center line"" is the principle of Wing Chun. /CGTN Photo ""Protecting the center line"" is the principle of Wing Chun. /CGTN Photo

The old doctrine of Wing Chun requires the disciples to have a positive energy, promote harmony, and respect their teachers.

""Without sounds, it is also an expression of feelings."" This year's International Day of the Deaf is marked on September 26. CGTN spoke to Chen Xin, a Generation-Z boy, to find out his stories with these ""silent"" friends.

Chen is a student in Nanjing, the capital city of east China's Jiangsu Province. He has another identity as a sign language interpreter. Since he got a Chinese qualification certificate for sign language interpreters in June 2018, he has provided more than 1,200 hours' service. In countless memories, Chen's most impressive experience was on February 11, 2020. At 10:08 p.m. that day, he got a message from the medical staff of Huoshenshan Hospital in Wuhan, central China's Hubei Province. They asked for a sign language interpreter for a 75-year-old female COVID-19 patient. This deaf woman was too frail to communicate by writing. Chen made a video call with her in the afternoon the next day. In a critical condition at the time, she could not eat due to a sore throat for about five days. Chen reported her condition to the medical staff and told her things she needed to care. He encouraged her to be confident for recovery as people from all over China were giving strong support to Wuhan people. Chen had second and third follow-up video calls with her before she recovered eventually.

After telling this story, Chen put on his red volunteer vest and began his one-day work as a sign language interpreter at 9:00 a.m.. His deaf friends were excited to meet him at the hall of the Disabled Persons' Federation. ""Put on the earphones and push the button when hearing the sound."" He patiently interpreted the doctor's instructions and helped eight deaf people in their listening tests in the morning. After the lunch with deaf friends, Chen had tight afternoon schedule. He recorded some sign language videos about the Delta variant in the studio, held sign language training for enthusiasts and community workers, and accompanied a hearing-impaired patient to see a doctor in the hospital. Finishing the work, Chen arrived at Longchi Lake at 5:30 p.m. as he appointed with his deaf friends. He talked with them 30 years older than him about different topics, from their daily life to the construction of the city. He said, as Generation-Z, he wanted to develop new things and learn new areas. The statistics show that Nanjing has more than 12,000 hearing-impaired people with disability certificate. However, only six sign language interpreters work with Nanjing Disabled Person's Federation. On average, only one sign language interpreter can be booked for every 2,000 hearing-impaired people. After his graduation, Chen planed to be a professional sign language interpreter and offer services for deaf people in his region and all around China.

1724,Wonder boy in the field: Blind people can also play football,"04:32

China blind men's football team have finished fourth at the Tokyo Paralympic Games, matching their achievement in the Rio 2016 Paralympics. Although very young, the team established in 2006 has already scored some outstanding achievements. They won a silver medal at the 2008 Beijing Paralympics, a bronze medal at the 2010 World Championships and six Asian Championships. It can be said that they are the top in Asia and one of the best in the world. In this team, there is a dream chaser who is sunny and optimistic. His name is Liu Meng.

Liu Meng in football training. /CGTN Liu Meng in football training. /CGTN

In 1995, Liu was born in an ordinary family in southwest China's Shuitangpu Village, Yunnan Province. He was born with congenital keratitis. In elementary school, Liu couldn't even see the words on the blackboard. When he was 13 years old, Liu could not see anything any more. Liu was sent to the Kunming School for the Blind and Dumb by his parents. According to the plan, he should have been a masseur after graduation, like his other classmates. He had never imagined that his destiny would be linked to football. In school, Liu was very naughty and active. Once, he overheard the sound of mineral water bottles rolling on the ground. After that, he often played with his classmates by kicking plastic water bottles. This scene happened to be caught by Le Jiankun, the P.E. teacher of the school and the coach of Yunnan blind men's football team. Le told Liu that if he liked kicking, he would take him out of the school for a new thing. In this way, Liu came into contact with blind football for the first time. In 2009, Liu joined Yunnan blind men's football team, and his life has unlimited possibilities since then.

For the athletes with visual impairments, localization by sounds in the game of football 5-a-side is an essential skill. Except the goalkeepers, who have a normal vision, other players' vision is impaired. To be fair, players must wear blindfolds during the game. They distinguish the direction and location by the sound of a special football which has 6 built-in bells. They have to complete a series of actions such as running with the ball, passing to other teammates, and shooting in complete darkness. Teammates seek cooperation through screaming. The coach and goalkeeper are responsible for guiding the direction of the midfield and backfield. There is also a guider standing behind the opponent's goal to guide the offense. When moving, tackling or looking for a ball, the player must make ""voy, voy, voy"" or similar sounds to ensure safety.

""When they take every step, they must overcome the fear of unknown ahead."" The words from the leader of China blind men's football team tell us the difficulties and challenges in the blind football. They can't see the path of the ball and can't estimate the speed of the ball. They can only feel it through touching the ball by their feet. The collision and injuries in training are frequent. Liu Meng once wanted to give up his football career and be an ordinary masseur because of serious injury. ""I was very young when I first played football. I was afraid then. I got hurt seriously in a game. That made me wonder what I could do if my feet has some problems when I already cannot see anything. Things could not get worse."" However, at the thought of the joy that football brings to him and the time spent with his teammates, Liu returned to the field again.

1725,The business secret of the 'rabbit raising brothers'丨1.4 Billion,"06:05

Wei Guikang was born in Shicun Village, Lingnan Town, Heshan City in southwest China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. He runs a rabbit raising cooperative with his younger brother, Wei Guiguo.

The project is not only the result of the two brothers' entrepreneurship but also a chance for many local families to get rid of poverty.

Heshan: From the city of light and heat to poverty-stricken

Heshan is located in southwest China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. /CGTN Heshan is located in southwest China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. /CGTN

Heshan used to be referred to as the city of light and heat. Coal deposits had contributed to its prosperity. ""In its heyday, tile-roofed houses were built everywhere. You could see myriad lights,"" Wei Guikang recalled. After years of mining, the raw minerals ended. The county-level of Heshan became a resource-exhausted city and, consequently, a poverty-stricken county.

Business opportunities

Wei graduated from college in 2012. After about half a year of research, he found that local meat rabbits were in short supply in Guangxi. So he decided to go back and start his own business with his younger brother. They set up a warren and divided the work.

Wei brothers rabbit farm./CGTN Wei brothers rabbit farm./CGTN

Wei Guikang does the sales, focusing on rabbit meat prices and marketing channels. Wei Guiguo manages the breeding part of the business, meaning that by six every morning he is already up and around the warren. ""Compared with raising chickens and ducks, rabbits are more difficult. More than 10,000 rabbits need to be health checked every day,"" Wei Guikang said.

Wei brothers' warren. /CGTN Wei brothers' warren. /CGTN

After several years, their cooperation and hard-work started bearing fruits, and the warren began to take shape and reap benefits.

Working together to get rid of poverty

In 2016, Heshan municipal government came to the brothers, hoping that they could work with poverty-stricken households to lift them out of poverty.

The rabbit cooperative. /CGTN The rabbit cooperative. /CGTN

However, few of those households knew about the cooperative. With a lack of funds and technology, they were reluctant to participate. ""Poverty-stricken households in other villages were not familiar with our cooperative. Wining their trust and having them join the cooperative was rather difficult,"" said Wei Guikang. Wei Guikang explained the business model and how both parts could work together. After joining the cooperative, members receive technical guidance on how to breed rabbits. He intends to show that this rabbit cooperative can truly help the poor households overcome their difficulties.

Wei visits a poor household. /CGTN Wei visits a poor household. /CGTN

The first problem was money, so the cooperative gives registered families rabbits to breed, free of charge. Second, technique. The cooperative provides free technical guidance on how to raise rabbits. The third question was sales. Who would buy the rabbits? The cooperative buys all the mature rabbits that the poor households raise. What's more, the cooperative sustains its own profits and losses regardless of the market price, eliminating the worries of the poor households.

Chejiawo Village is located on the edge of the Horqin Sandy Land in Horqin Left Wing Rear Banner, north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. Due to the lack of arable land, villagers hardly had any harvests, which led to slender incomes. The problem of poverty was evident.

""My wife got sick and my children had to go to school. We had nothing more to sell off in the house. We were broke,"" villager Chang Ying said, remembering those days in the past. Chang, 53, is a member of the Caogan group of Chejiawo Village. He couldn't afford his wife's medical expenses or his children's tuition fees, making the family one of the registered poverty-stricken households in the village.

China launched the targeted poverty alleviation policy in rural areas in 2014. In response to the national policy, Chejiawo established the Caogan Desert Scenic Area, aiming at developing the tourism industry.

The desert can be a gold mine

To include poor households in the industry, the national government pushed a special project, lending 50,000 yuan to each poor family. There were also measures implemented in the scenic spot to help improve people's lives.

Tourism in the scenic spot. /CGTN Tourism in the scenic spot. /CGTN

After negotiation, poor households were allowed to use loans to purchase camels, horses and all the materials necessary to operate the spot. Village cadres started to encourage residents to make money in the scenic spot. Looking at the desert, Chang never thought it could attract tourists, so he only bought one horse to give it a try. Unexpectedly, the scenic spot quickly attracted a large number of tourists, and so his income improved.

""We are so happy that I'm earning money every day. I make hundreds of yuan every day. I've got money in my pocket,"" Chang added. With the help of the government, Chang bought more horses and camels. By 2018, the family was lifted out of poverty. ""We used to live in earthen bungalows. I didn't even dare to imagine that we could move into a new house,"" Chang said.

With rapid and extensive urbanization, more and more people are moving to the cities, leaving their old houses unattended. The villages bearing people's childhood memories are fading away with time.

Chenjia Village may be one of the most insignificant among the ""lost villages."" Boasting stunning landscapes and a temperate climate, the place used to be a sanctuary for a simple life. As time changed, a declining economy made the residents move, leaving the place with a few people and many dilapidated houses.

To make matters worse, girls got reluctant to get married and settle down in this remote village. A high number of bachelors led to a decreasing birth rate over the years. ""In the near future, such villages could faint and disappear,"" said Cheng Jingying about her first impression of Chenjia Village.

Cheng came to Chenjia in 2006, only to find a scene of desolation and ruin. As a poverty alleviation cadre, she was determined to make a change and save the village. ""We visit the poor families to make sure the alleviation policies are fairly implemented,"" said Cheng.

To salvage the village, the most important thing is to raise the locals' income. There are a lot of moso bamboos on the mountains. Many villagers use the bamboo to make umbrella ribs. In addition to implementing the national poverty alleviation policy, the cadres find ways to expand the sale of umbrella ribs, a step to improve villagers' lives.

Unfortunately, COVID-19 has greatly impacted the sale this year, causing the number of poor households to increase from 20 to 40. Cheng and her colleagues contacted an umbrella factory to purchase goods from the village.

The orders required new types of umbrella ribs, so Cheng took the sample and taught the technique door-to-door in the village. ""The hole is for the wooden stick. Cut it from the middle and the bottom. Apply oilpaper to it and make a hole…"" After teaching, villagers began making new umbrella ribs at home.

1728,'Blood brothers' in a poverty-stricken village丨1.4 Billion,"07:26

Jifeng, a small village of just over 1,000 people, was one of the most impoverished villages in central China's Hunan Province a decade ago. Located in Xiangxi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture, it had poor transportation, underdeveloped infrastructure and a sluggish economy. The lack of financial resources led to low income, leaving many households poverty-stricken.

This story, however is not just about the remote village, but about two men who became ""blood brothers"". In early 2008, Lei Qiming was selected as a member of the poverty alleviation team of the CPC Xiangxi Commission for Discipline Inspection. On his very first day in Jifeng Village, he heard about Xiang Deren.

Xiang's household was registered as poverty-stricken. He had a reputation for being lazy. Living alone in a dilapidated bungalow covered with weeds, he didn't work and spent most of his time drinking. As he had refused to work with the poverty alleviation team, there had been little progress. His case had become a hard nut to crack.

Lei immediately decided to pay him a visit. But again and again, he was left out in the cold. ""He didn't believe me or the poverty alleviation team at all. I went to speak with him every day. Sometimes I yelled, sometimes I scolded, sometimes I was sarcastic,"" said Lei.

Soon however, Lei came to realize that the situations of poverty-stricken households were not always the same, and different methods should be used. No longer preaching at Xiang, he tried to communicate with him and helped him to regain confidence, so that he could shake off poverty on his own. Xiang's wife had left him years ago, taking their son and daughter with her. But she had remarried, and Xiang said he wanted his boy to come back and live with him.

Homegrown beans, spring water and ancient stone mills make the pristine delicacy from the mountains. Bad transport, however, restricted villagers from selling the product outside the remote area. They worked hard day and night only for a small income. ""We had no money and lived form hand to mouth. We got up at about 2 a.m. every day to grind the beans, collect spring water from the mountain with two buckets and carry them back with a shoulder pole. The path was very rugged. We could only take back one or two buckets a day,"" said Shi.

""At that time, my life was full of interest,"" said Wang. However, an illness interrupted his happy life. In the 1980s, when his son was a few months old, there was something wrong with the baby. His son was diagnosed with cortical dysplasia, which is not only incurable but can get worse with age.

The sudden shock crushed the ordinary family. Having to look after his son, he couldn't go out to work. The whole family lived on only three acres of land. After multiple setbacks, Wang became a registered poverty-stricken household, spending his days drinking and earning only about 2,000 yuan a year.

In 2016, the government sent teams and helpers, to help with the livelihoods of poverty-stricken households. Poverty alleviation was officially on track. During the survey, the poverty alleviation cadres found that some poor households merely waited and depended on others for help, and lacked motivation. For example, the medical expenses of Wang's son cost the savings of the poor family. But spiritual indolence and self-abandonment were also the internal causes of their poverty. 'It's a total loss of hope. I became demotivated. There's no meaning in making money anymore. No cure for my boy. I could only spend the rest of my life in pain,"" said Wang.

If you want to become rich, you must work hard. In 2016, with the government's help, he applied for the income generating project to grow watermelons and received 18,000 yuan. The government also provided Wang with a public welfare post. From cleaning, Wang earned 750 yuan per month, which relieved his stress.

Once again, he has hope for life. It turned Wang from being passive to being active, and he strived to improve his living conditions. Having income from land, various subsidies and ad-hoc work, Wang got out of poverty in over a year. In 2018, with a room to spare, Wang bought a set of tofu production equipment and started selling it. Selling tofu brings him a net income of 100 yuan a day. His life is getting better.

In the past few years, Wang has become a spokesperson for poverty alleviation, and uses his experience to encourage other poor families to shake off poverty through hard work. ""We have to be positive. We just have to work a little bit harder. Under the poverty alleviation policy, we can surely make it,"" said Wang.

Meanwhile, the government also pays attention to the protection of the elderly and the sick. A retirement and care center were set up in the village. Wang and his son are qualified for it. Knowing that his son will be in good hands, Wang was relieved from his biggest anxiety.

1733,Makelimu's Wish丨1.4 Billion,"08:20

Tuanjie Village was one of nine poor villages in Chahandusi Township, Haidong City, in northwest China's Qinghai Province.

Tuanjie Village /CGTN Tuanjie Village /CGTN

Tuanjie has an aging population who mostly make their living from the soil. For Makelimu, however, life here is especially hard as three of the four members of his family have disabilities. His wife has a speech disability, his son is hearing impaired, and he has a grade three physical disability. As a result, the family was one of the most poverty-stricken households in the village.

Makelimu (C) and his family /CGTN Makelimu (C) and his family /CGTN

Standing less than 1.5 meters tall, Makelimu, who is middle-aged, cannot do physical work for long hours. The spirit is willing, as they say, but the flesh is weak. I used to do odd jobs where I was underpaid, and that upset me. Normal people earned about 10 yuan a day. I got no more than five. It was far from enough, but I could do nothing about it.

As he suffers from a physical disability, Makelimu cannot do physical work for long hours. /CGTN As he suffers from a physical disability, Makelimu cannot do physical work for long hours. /CGTN

Everything has changed since 2016, when Makelimu took up his first career – raising cattle. With the support of the national targeted poverty alleviation policy, poverty-stricken families in Tuanjie Village got 21,600 yuan per person as seed money. Mahaibi, the village secretary, helped Makelimu build a 50-square-meter breeding shed that helped kick-start his cattle business.

With little prior knowledge, Makelimu struggled in the beginning. Therefore, Mahaibi introduced him to a fellow villager who had a professional breeding shed. ""It has a poor appetite. You can add some digestive powder and a little bit of salt in the fodder."" ""The white grass has low nutritional value. You need some silage.""

The secretary wrote down all the villager's advice and personally instructed Makelimu on what he should do. His career gradually got on track. Considering his family situation, the village cadres helped him increase the income in many ways. As many villagers go out to work, their farmland is left unattended, so Mahaibi encouraged them to contract Makelimu to take care of it.

Makelimu and his wife take a break /CGTN Makelimu and his wife take a break /CGTN

With their help, Makelimu's life has changed greatly. He used to beg for work. Things couldn't have been worse. Now, as his income increases, Makelimu has new expectations for life.

Makelimu's life has changed greatly /CGTN Makelimu's life has changed greatly /CGTN

""Makelimu. Here is your goal. You have four cattle now. In the future, you will have 40."" With the encouragement of the secretary, Makelimu has the drive to move forward. Now, Makelimu and his family have moved into their new home. Their former dilapidated and leaky house is history. Although the disabilities remain, everything is different as their living conditions are better. Even villagers said Makelimu looks like a totally different person. He hopes that more people like him are able to lift themselves out of poverty through their own efforts under the targeted poverty alleviation policy.

1886,What does the moon look like from China's space station?,"China on Tuesday unveiled photos of the moon captured by Chinese astronaut Tang Hongbo during his stay aboard the Tianhe core module of China's space station.

Mid-Autumn Festival, which falls on the 15th day of the eighth month on the Chinese lunar calendar, when the moon is at its fullest and brightest at night, fell on Tuesday, September 21, this year. It's an important traditional Chinese holiday that celebrates the full moon, a good harvest and family reunion.

The photos were released on Tuesday as a gift to the Chinese people.

1887,China Space Station: Shenzhou-12 crew is returning to Earth,"After a three-month journey in China's space station, members of the Shenzhou-12 manned spacecraft are returning to their home planet later this month.

It is expected to touch down in the Dongfeng landing site in north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. A search and rescue team from China's Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in the Gobi Desert recently conducted drills at the landing site for the upcoming return of the Shenzhou-12 crew.

The Dongfeng site usually serves as a backup landing site to the Siziwang Banner site. The reason behind the change is in where the taikonauts came from. Returning from a space station can be difference than from a spaceship. It's harder for the land crew to calculate the exact landing point. So, landing in the desert can be a safer choice.

With that said, locating the return capsule in desert is much harder for the search and rescue team. We can only hope that they have fully prepared to welcome China's space heroes.

Taikonauts' preparation before heading home

One of the main tasks for the three crew members before coming back to Earth is preparing their bodies.

""We need to increase physical activities, training our muscles, bones, and heart and lung functions to prepare for the impacts when entering the atmosphere and hitting on the ground, and to readjust to Earth's environment,"" Nie Haisheng, commander of the three-man crew, told China Central Television in a video interview last month.

Besides exercising, the crewmates will also undergo inventory check in the space station, making it convenient for the next batch of taikonauts to know where to find what they need. They will set up some equipment and functions as well to prepare for future missions.

1890,Space station project lifts off China's space dream,"China is preparing the second crewed trip to its space station now under construction. It is just one of many visits to expand the newly built lab hovering some 400 kilometers above Earth's surface.

The country has stepped up its efforts to explore space, with a rover roaming the surface of Mars and an unmanned mission to fetch soil from the moon. However, one of the most incredible achievements is the China Space Station (CSS) under construction, which marks the country's largest ever manned space mission.

The CSS is the latest step in China's manned space project, which began in 1992, since when China has launched several manned spacecraft missions and tested technologies for space walks and spacecraft docking.

The new space lab is scheduled to be completed after 11 launch missions that include sending one core module and two lab modules into orbit. The endeavors also include four manned flights and four cargo vessel launches.

On September 20, the Tianzhou-3 cargo spacecraft was sent into space and automatically docked with the CSS core module after 6.5 hours of flight.

The Tianzhou spacecraft is the world's strongest cargo vessel, with up to 6.8 tonnes of supplies and fuel at the time of liftoff, according to Yang Sheng, chief designer of the cargo spaceship system.

The fast automatic docking technology is also among the most advanced in the world, shortening the docking time by one hour compared to Tianzhou-2's mission. Both Tianzhou-2 and Tianzhou-3 are currently docked with the core module, another milestone for the Chinese crewed space project.

The space station has already bid farewell to its first group of guests. Astronauts Nie Haisheng, Tang Hongbo and Liu Boming safely returned to Earth on September 17 aboard the Shenzhou-12 spacecraft after a three-month stint in orbit.

It was a fruitful trip by any measure. The trio conducted loads of tasks and verified China's ability to provide a long-term living environment in space. The crew also pulled off two space walks with the help of a robotic arm that is designed to move one astronaut or a piece of equipment on the CSS.

The CSS is slated to be completed by the end of 2022. By then, it will be able to harbor astronauts from different countries for scientific experiments.

Once fully operational, the station will be one of the only two space stations in orbit, along with the International Space Station (ISS). However, China's space station could be the only space station available for scientists and researchers if the ISS is retired in the next decade.

China has been speeding up its pace in space explorations.

Last year, the country completed 39 launch missions, ranking second worldwide behind the U.S., according to the Blue Book of China Aerospace Science and Technology Activities 2020.

The number of launch missions will exceed 40 this year, the book added.

China also carried out its first interplanetary flight to Mars. The mission's success made China the second country after the U.S. to independently deploy a rover on the Martian surface.

The mission, known as Tianwen-1, was one of the most complex of its kind because it was a ""three-in-one"" attempt that included orbiting, landing and roving maneuvers.

China's Mars probe landed in May on the southern part of an icy area called Utopia Planitia after a nearly seven-month voyage from Earth. The rover, named Zhurong, started its mobile mission after landing and sending back pictures and videos from Mars, including a selfie with the lander, a much larger machine that assisted Zhurong's landing.

Zhurong has already completed its planned 90-Martian-day mission and has traveled over 1,000 meters. It is now going through a dormancy period and is expected to resume signal connection with Earth in early November.

China has also made giant leaps in lunar exploration. The Chang'e-5 probe returned to Earth with fresh lunar soil samples, the first in more than four decades.

In addition, the country launched the last satellite of the BeiDou Navigation Satellite System in June 2020, marking the completion of its self-developed BeiDou constellation, one of the four global navigation networks alongside the U.S. GPS, Russia's GLONASS and the European Union's Galileo.

China's space exploration didn't stop there. The country announced more plans in June, including exploring asteroids sometime around 2025 and the Jovian system in 2030, collecting samples from Mars in 2030 and exploring the polar region of the moon in the coming five years."

1892,China aims to boost its competitiveness in IPR,"China aims to improve its competitiveness in the area of intellectual property rights (IPR) under a central government blueprint for 2021 to 2035.

The blueprint, titled ""Guidelines for Building a Powerful Country with Intellectual Property Rights,"" was released by the central government last week.

According to the blueprint, by 2025, China aims to make ""patent-intensive industries"" account for 13 percent of its GDP. And the number of ""high-value"" patents for every 10,000 people should double from 6.3 to 12. By 2035, the country's competitiveness in IPR should be ""among the top in the world.""

At a press briefing held in Beijing on Thursday, Shen Changyu, commissioner of the National Intellectual Property Administration, said the blueprint will guide China to implement the innovation-driven development strategy with greater efforts.

In particular, the country will strengthen IPR protection to create an innovative environment, boost scientific and technological cooperation and promote the breakthroughs in key technologies, he said.

Legal efforts are a highlight of the plan.

""We'll speed up legislation to protect intellectual property in new industries, such as big data, artificial intelligence and genetic technology,"" Shen said.

Lin Guanghai, president of Civil Adjudication Tribunal No. 3 (IPR Division) of the Supreme People's Court, said the court will firmly hold the concept that protecting IPR is protecting innovation.

""We'll equally protect the legitimate rights of domestic and foreign market entities to build an open, fair, justified and unbiased environment for scientific and technological development,"" he said.

The country also vows to actively participate in global governance of IPR. Efforts will include pushing forward bilateral and multilateral IPR negotiations in trade, encouraging foreign organizations to provide IPR services in China, and promoting Chinese brands globally."

1899,White paper: China's eco-environment sees historic changes,"China has decreed that lucid waters and lush mountains are invaluable assets and after working towards this for years, a series of achievements were realized in 2020, according to a white paper released on Tuesday.

In cities at or above prefecture level, 87 percent of days had good or excellent air quality. Approximately 90 percent of farmland and 93 percent of land plots that were previously labelled as polluted were rendered safe for use.

Imports of foreign solid waste were also stopped as scheduled.

Nearly 90 percent of the Chinese people were satisfied with the eco-environment last year, the white paper found.

The country has also improved its management and inspection systems for nature reserves and eco-environmental protection zones, and has gradually shifted to a path of prioritizing eco-environmental conservation and pursuing green and low-carbon development.

China leads the world in terms of new energy use and progress in energy conservation. Between 2015 and 2020, its energy consumption per unit of GDP fell by 13.2 percent and carbon emissions dropped by 18.8 percent, the white paper said.

Over the past few years, China has formulated and enforced stringent systems for eco-environmental protection, emphasizing that a sound eco-environment is the most inclusive contributor to people's well-being and a salient feature of moderate prosperity in all respects.

By enacting the strictest Environmental Protection Law in its history, and formulating and amending a range of other laws and regulations, China created a legal framework on the eco-environment that covers all environmental factors in major fields, the white paper said.

A series of eco-environmental protection systems have been established in areas including efficient use of resources, conservation and restoration and lifelong accountability for damage, contributing to positive changes in the development model, eco-friendly habits among the people, and environmental protection and governance, it said."
1900,"Merck says COVID-19 pill cuts risk of death, hospitalization by half","Pharmaceutical company Merck said Friday that its experimental COVID-19 pill reduced hospitalizations and deaths by half in people recently infected with the coronavirus and that it would soon ask health officials in the U.S. and around the world to authorize its use.

If cleared by regulators, it would be the first pill shown to treat COVID-19, adding a whole new, easy-to-use weapon to an arsenal that already includes the vaccine.

The company said it will soon seek approval from health officials in the U.S. and around the world to authorize the pill's use. A decision from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration could come within weeks. And the drug, if it gets the OK, could be distributed quickly soon afterward.

All other COVID-19 treatments now authorized in the U.S. require an IV or injection. A pill taken at home, by contrast, would ease pressure on hospitals and could also help curb outbreaks in poorer and more remote corners of the world that don't have access to the more expensive infusion therapies.

""This would allow us to treat many more people much more quickly and, we trust, much less expensively,"" said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University, who was not involved in the research.

Merck and its partner Ridgeback Biotherapeutics said early results showed patients who received the drug, molnupiravir, within five days of COVID-19 symptoms had about half the rate of hospitalization and death as those who received a dummy pill.

The study tracked 775 adults with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 who were considered high risk for severe disease because of health problems such as obesity, diabetes or heart disease. The results have not been reviewed by outside experts, the usual procedure for vetting new medical research.

Among patients taking molnupiravir, 7.3 percent were either hospitalized or died at the end of 30 days, compared with 14.1 percent of those getting the dummy pill. After that time period, there were no deaths among those who received the drug, compared with eight in the placebo group, according to Merck.

The results were so strong that an independent group of medical experts monitoring the trial recommended stopping it early.

Company executives said they plan to submit the data to the FDA in the coming days.

Vaccines still important

Even with the news of a potentially effective new treatment, experts stressed the importance of vaccines for controlling the pandemic, given that they help prevent transmission and also reduce the severity of illness in those who do get infected.

White House coronavirus coordinator Jeff Zients said that vaccination will remain the government's main strategy for controlling the pandemic. ""We want to prevent infections, not just wait to treat them when they happen,"" he said.

Dr Anthony Fauci, the government's foremost authority on infectious diseases, called the results from Merck ""very good news.""

Merck only studied its drug in people who were not vaccinated. But FDA regulators may consider authorizing it for broader use in vaccinated patients who get breakthrough COVID-19 symptoms.

Andrew Pekosz of Johns Hopkins University predicted vaccines and antiviral drugs would ultimately be used together to protect against the worst effects of COVID-19.

""These shouldn't be seen as replacements for vaccination – the two should be seen as two strategies that can be used together to significantly reduce severe disease,"" said Pekosz, a virology specialist.

Patients take four pills of molnupiravir twice a day for five days. Side effects were reported by both groups in the Merck trial, but they were slightly more common among those who received a dummy pill. The company did not specify the problems.

Earlier study results showed the drug did not benefit patients who were already hospitalized with severe disease. That's not surprising, given that antiviral drugs are most effective when used before the virus ramps up in the body.

The U.S. has approved one antiviral drug, remdesivir, for COVID-19, and allowed emergency use of three antibody therapies that help the immune system fight the virus. But all the drugs are expensive and have to be given by IV or injection at hospitals or clinics, and supplies have been stretched by the latest surge of the Delta variant.

The antibody drugs have been shown to reduce hospitalization and death by roughly 70 percent when given to high-risk patients, roughly 20 percentage points more than Merck's pill. But experts cautioned against comparing results from the two, given the preliminary nature of Merck's data.

Health experts, including Fauci, have long called for a convenient pill that patients could take when COVID-19 symptoms first appear, much the way Tamiflu is given to help speed recovery from the flu.

Like other antivirals, Merck's pill works by interfering with the virus's ability to copy its genetic code and reproduce itself.

The U.S. government has committed to purchasing enough pills to treat 1.7 million people, assuming the FDA authorizes the drug. Merck said it can produce pills for 10 million patients by the end of the year and has contracts with governments worldwide. The company has not announced prices.

Several other companies, including Pfizer and Roche, are studying similar drugs and could report results in the coming weeks and months.

Merck had planned to enroll more than 1,500 patients in its late-stage trial before the independent board stopped it early. The results reported Friday included patients across Latin America, Europe and Africa. Executives estimated 10 percent of patients studied were from the U.S."

A joint European-Japanese spacecraft got its first glimpse of Mercury as it swung by the solar system's innermost planet while on a mission to deliver two probes into orbit in 2025.

The BepiColombo mission made the first of six flybys of Mercury at 11:34 p.m. GMT Friday, using the planet's gravity to slow the spacecraft down.

After swooping past Mercury at altitudes of under 200 kilometers, the spacecraft took a low-resolution black-and-white photo with one of its monitoring cameras before zipping off again.

The European Space Agency (ESA) said the captured image shows the Northern Hemisphere and Mercury's characteristic pock-marked features, among them the 166-kilometer-wide (103-mile-wide) Lermontov crater.

The joint mission by the European agency and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency was launched in 2018, flying once past Earth and twice past Venus on its journey to the solar system's smallest planet.

Five further flybys are needed before BepiColombo is sufficiently slowed down to release ESA's Mercury Planetary Orbiter and JAXA's Mercury Magnetospheric Orbiter. The two probes will study Mercury's core and processes on its surface, as well as its magnetic sphere.

The mission is named after Italian scientist Giuseppe 'Bepi' Colombo, who is credited with helping develop the gravity assist maneuver that NASA's Mariner 10 first used when it flew to Mercury in 1974."

Vaccine safety surveillance data in Canada indicated ""relatively higher rates of myocarditis and/or pericarditis reported after Spikevax (Moderna) vaccination compared to Comirnaty (Pfizer-BioNTech),"" said a statement from the Public Health Agency of Canada.

The data also suggested that heart inflammation occurs more often in adolescents and adults under 30 years of age, more often in males, and more often after a second dose of an mRNA vaccine and most occur within seven days of vaccination.

It also said majority of the affected individuals experienced relatively mild illness and recovered quickly.

The risk of cardiac complications, including heart inflammation, has been shown to be substantially increased following COVID-19 infections, with the risks higher after the infection than after vaccination, according to the statement.

The benefits of mRNA shots in preventing COVID-19 continue to outweigh the risks, regulators in the United States, EU and the World Health Organization have said."
1903,U.S. reporter reveals how media keeps hyping COVID-19 lab-leak theory,"Screenshot of the article from the website of Los Angeles Times.

Screenshot of the article from the website of Los Angeles Times.

Despite mounting evidence that the novel coronavirus originated from nature, U.S. media including CNN, the Intercept and the Atlantic keep promoting the lab-leak theory of the virus, wrote Michael Hiltzik, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist.

The article, titled ""New evidence undermines the COVID lab-leak theory – but the press keeps pushing it,"" was published on the Los Angeles Times earlier this week.

""When it comes to the pandemic, pseudoscience has outweighed real science at almost every turn. One of the best examples of that is the unsupported assertion that the virus causing COVID-19 escaped from a Chinese laboratory,"" Hiltzik wrote.

The lab-leak claim, first emerged during the Trump administration, was part of ""a White House information campaign demonizing China,"" he noted.

Hiltzik cited a series of recent studies on COVID-19 origins by virologists, which all added to the evidence that the virus jumped from animals to humans.

However, some U.S. media have downplayed or entirely ignored the latest scientific findings, while continuing to hype the lab-leak hypothesis using misleading techniques, he exposed.

Just last month, CNN aired an hour-long documentary entitled ""The Origins of COVID-19: Searching for the Source."" In the program, it seemed both the proponents of the zoonotic origin theory and those of the lab-leak theory were given airtime.

The proponents of the zoonotic origin theory were all professional virologists, including Kristian Andersen of the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla and Peter Daszak, a prominent zoologist.

But as Hiltzik pointed out, the guests supporting the lab-leak theory include Alina Chan, a researcher at the Broad Institute, a biomedical research center, and Josh Rogin, a Washington Post columnist, neither of whom have any experience in virology. The program also did not mention the fact that Chan is co-writing a book about COVID-19's origins that is expected to prominently feature the lab-leak theory.

""By posing these two theories as simply two equally plausible solutions to a mystery, CNN glosses over the fact that the virological community regards the animal origin as vastly more likely rather than a lab leak. In fact, the two hypotheses are miles apart in credibility,"" Hiltzik wrote.

He called attention to the two clear trends on COVID-19 origins tracing: evidence of artificial manipulation of the virus has faded, while for zoonotic transmission is constantly accumulating.

""No one who reports on the issue without acknowledging these two trends should be trusted,"" he wrote."

A team of Chinese and foreign researchers has discovered a new species of Neosuchia, an ancient vertebrate that lived about 101 million years ago, according to a study recently published in the journal Cretaceous Research.

The joint study was led by the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology (IVPP) under the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

The fossils of the new species, which was named Yanjisuchus longshanensis, were found in the city of Yanji in northeast China's Jilin Province.

The ancient vertebrates lived in the middle Cretaceous period about 101 million years ago, when the region was warm, humid and rich in species, according to the study.

The discovery may help in understanding the evolution of Neosuchia and how the diversity of its species was affected by climate, as well as the origin of modern crocodilians, said the IVPP."

Algeria on Wednesday started manufacturing Sinovac COVID-19 vaccines in a joint venture with China.

The production line in the eastern province of Constantine was inaugurated at a ceremony attended by Algerian Prime Minister Ayman Benabderrahmane and Chinese Ambassador Li Lianhe.

In his opening remarks, Benabderrahmane said the facility, a partnership between China's biopharmaceutical firm Sinovac Biotech and Algeria's pharmaceutical group Saidal, is likely to pave the way for the production of other vaccines in the near future.

""This unit will enhance Algeria's vaccine self-sufficiency and health security,"" the president said.

He added that the production line aims to produce 6 million doses of Sinovac vaccine by the end of this year and 96 million doses each year thereafter, ""provided the existence of enough raw material and orders locally and internationally.""

The Chinese ambassador hailed the completion of this project as ""a milestone in the history of cooperation between China and Algeria, which share distinguished historical friendship and convergent views on many issues.""

Li noted that ""the two countries' goals for development are similar as they have exchanged support for each other during the past decades.""

""In response to Algeria's request, China has overcome the huge pressure of domestic demand for Sinovac vaccines and made unremitting efforts to supply them to Algeria,"" he said, citing that China signed a contract to provide 15 million doses of vaccines to Algeria, becoming the largest vaccine supplier to the North African country.

The Chinese envoy vowed that China is always ready to continue strengthening cooperation with Algeria in various fields, and expand bilateral cooperation within the framework of the Belt and Road Initiative with high quality.

Since the COVID-19 outbreak, Algeria and China have been closely cooperating to fight the pandemic. In February 2020, Algeria was one of the first countries to send medical donations to China, which, in return, has sent several batches of medical aid and experts to the African nation."
1906,COVID-19 rebound in China's Fujian under control: official,"The recent COVID-19 rebound in southeast China's Fujian Province has been brought under control, while the latest flare-up in the country's northeastern Heilongjiang Province is at a critical stage, a health official said Wednesday.

Continuous efforts should be made to prevent COVID-19 resurgence and contain the further spread of the virus, Mi Feng, spokesperson for the National Health Commission (NHC), told a press conference in Beijing.

The COVID-19 pandemic is still ravaging across the globe, with the Delta variant being the dominant strain. In recent months, China has seen a number of cluster infections caused by imported cases.

Starting from early September, fresh coronavirus cases had been found in several cities in Fujian. As of Tuesday, a total of 470 cases were reported in the province. Thanks to the swift actions by local government and expert team sent by the NHC, the outbreak has been basically put under control, said Cui Gang, an official from the Disease Control and Prevention Department of the NHC.

Since last week, new cases were detected in Heilongjiang. The province reported 75 cases as of Tuesday and is still at a critical stage of fighting against the virus, according to Cui.

As China's week-long National Day holiday and cold weather are around the corner, experts stressed that epidemic control and prevention efforts should not be relaxed.

Over 2.2 billion COVID-19 vaccine doses administered in China

More than 2.206 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines have been administered across the Chinese mainland as of Tuesday, data from the NHC showed.

More than 1.04 billion people have been fully inoculated against the virus, which is about 74 percent of the country's total population.

China aims to achieve herd immunity by the end of this year. The country's top respiratory expert Zhong Nanshan has said that more than 80 percent of the total population needs be vaccinated to achieve that goal.

Some vulnerable groups have received a booster shot

Wang Huaqing, chief expert on the immunization program at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, confirmed that some vulnerable groups have received a booster vaccine dose six months after full-course vaccinations.

He said experts advise three groups of people take a booster shot: people with weakened immune functions and seniors aged over 60; staff working at high risk areas from imported cases, such as medical staff, those employed in airports and customs; and people who have to travel overseas for work or study.

But further study and evaluation of the epidemic development is needed before a decision can be made on whether the entire population needs an extra dose, he said."
1907,China's 2021 anti-piracy operation helps clean up cyberspace,"A national anti-piracy operation targeting copyright infringement on the internet has helped clean up cyberspace, an official statement said Tuesday.

Copyright law enforcement departments at various levels have investigated 445 cases involving online copyright infringement, shutting down 245 illegal websites and mobile applications transmitting pirated content, and removing 618,300 web links with such content since the operation was launched in June, said the statement.

During the operation implemented by the National Copyright Administration of China in collaboration with three other central departments, internet platforms removed more than 8.46 million links that violated copyright laws and regulations, and major short video platforms removed some 80,400 such links associated with the Tokyo Olympic Games, it added.

Targets of the operation in 2021 included short videos edited from unauthorized films and TV programs and copied from others without due authorization, livestreaming programs disseminating unauthorized films, music, photos, games and other works as well as unauthorized use of copyrighted content in teaching and educational materials.

The operation is the 17th national campaign targeting online copyright infringement since 2005.

1908,Shanghai builds basic framework for global innovation center,"Shanghai's efforts to become a science and technology innovation center with global influence resulted in a series of achievements, meeting preset goals during the 13th Five-Year Plan, officials told a news conference on Wednesday.

By the end of 2020, the basic framework system of the Shanghai Science and Technology Innovation Center had been formed, and the core indicators had basically achieved the target, Wu Qing, the city's vice mayor, said.

Zhangjiang Comprehensive National Science Center, the core support in building the innovation center and a strategic highland to promote the output of major original innovation achievements, made progress in accelerating the construction of national laboratories and major national sci-tech infrastructures, Wu said.

The city witnessed a series of original sci-tech achievements and participated in multiple major national tasks in the science and technology field.

In 2020, papers published by Shanghai scientists in world-leading academic journals, such as Nature, Science and Cell, accounted for 32 percent of China's total. Researchers and scientists from Shanghai also facilitated national-level tasks such as the manned submersible Jiaolong, research icebreaker Xuelong, and BeiDou navigation satellites.

Breakthroughs were made in industries including integrated circuits, biomedicine and artificial intelligence.

Shanghai retained its position as the most attractive Chinese city favored by foreign talent for the eighth consecutive year last year, with an increasing appeal to high-level professionals.

Wu said the city will strive to become an important source of new scientific discoveries, technological inventions, industrial directions and development concepts by 2025, outlining eight core indicators which include total social R&D expenditure accounting for about 4.5 percent of the city's GDP and the number of high-tech enterprises surpassing 26,000."
1909,Cybersecurity is a key focus at 2021 World Internet Conference,"Cybersecurity took center stage at the 2021 World Internet Conference, which ended on Tuesday in China's water town of Wuzhen.

At ""The Light of Internet"" expo, part of the World Internet Conference, Chinese tech firm QI-ANXIN brought its AI face imitation technology, which allows users to make their favorite pop star's expressions mirror their own, record their own facial expressions and the pop star imitates their smile or frown.

The technology has already being used in many areas, such as animation production. But QI-ANXIN featured the product to draw attention to another topic: data privacy and protection.

""Because of the development of the technology, many people are using facial recognition technology to commit fraud. We hope to improve people's awareness of personal security and not allow your fingerprints to be randomly collected,"" said Hong Weifei, security expert of QI-ANXIN Technology Group.

Safety was highlighted at the exhibition, with some tech firms also providing solutions. Ant Group debuted its computer privacy solution called Morse Station, which can protect user data while also sharing it with other business partners. It was Ant Group's first time showcasing such technology, and the solution will be put into commercial use soon.

""Industries such as finance and healthcare, which have a high demand for data protection and data storage, can use our Morse Station to protect their data,"" said He Yuhao, senior product manager of Ant Group's AntChain.

In addition to QI-ANXIN and Ant Group, other firms such as Kaspersky Lab, Alibaba and SME Credit also showcased safety-related products.

While internet innovations were highlighted in previous years, personal data protection was a hot topic this year. In addition to the safety-related products at the expo, 14 leading global internet achievements were awarded on Sunday, with many of them also related to technology to tackle data protection and cybersecurity problems.

1910,Future of space: Shared space for all or another battleground?,"04:49

Space has been rather crowded recently. In June, China's Shenzhou-12 manned spacecraft sent three taikonauts into space. In July, Britain's Virgin Galactic sent its founder to join the party. Nine days later, American billionaire Jeff Bezos enjoyed the view of Earth for the first time. And most recently, the first all-civilian crew soared into orbit aboard a SpaceX rocket ship. All of a sudden, the galaxy of stars is no longer far away. But does it mean space travel for everyone is around the corner? Or is it just another battlefield for some countries?

A wonder: Space for everyone The SpaceX crew only spent five months learning everything. Virgin Galactic's pre-flight training program only took five days. And for Bezos' Blue Origin crew, it took 14 hours.

A still image from a video shows New Shepard rocket launching from Blue Origin's Launch Site One near Van Horn, Texas, U.S., July 20, 2021. /Reuters A still image from a video shows New Shepard rocket launching from Blue Origin's Launch Site One near Van Horn, Texas, U.S., July 20, 2021. /Reuters

People like Bezos have shown the world that after a short period of training, non-professional astronauts can successfully finish the flight. Conducting large-scale pre-flight training and enabling the general public to step into space are no longer impossible. However, even if someone is physically and intellectually capable of flying into space, the tickets are prohibitively expensive. Virgin Galactic's recent ticket sales had a starting price of $450,000 a seat. And they could end up selling for much higher. Not to mention SpaceX's ticket prices, which are more expensive because their spacecraft fly higher and longer after reaching space.

The priority: Safety guarantee Around 1.4 percent of manned spaceflight missions have resulted in fatalities. In a 2018 survey, one of the top two reasons given by 58 percent of Americans who said they would not want to board a spacecraft was that space travel would be ""too scary."" As private commercial companies have emerged, the safety issue has become more complicated. Last December, at the last minute of launching a Starship prototype, SpaceX ignored at least two warnings from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).

After Virgin Galactic's manned spaceflight in July, the FAA suspended its next flight because a warning light came on due to the vehicle going off trajectory. When training programs are simplified and non-specialists fly, how regulation can ensure the safety of commercial spaceflights is of paramount importance. Any accident would be an irreversible tragedy and a huge blow to the space industry.

A belief: Spirit of cooperation For the general public, there's still a long way to go before viewing the Earth from space, but for countries like America, space has long been a battlefield. About two years ago, former U.S. President Donald Trump officially created the U.S. Space Force, the first new U.S. military service in more than 70 years. ""Space is the world's newest war-fighting domain,"" he said. ""Amid grave threats to our national security, American superiority in space is absolutely vital. And we're leading, but we're not leading by enough. But very shortly, we'll be leading by a lot."" This aggressive statement is clearly a reflection of America's future direction, while, in fact, American space strategy dates back to the Cold War. The famous ""Star Wars Program"" proposed by the Reagan administration tried to take space as a battlefield and use space-based lasers to fight against the Soviet Union. And as more and more people can be sent into space more frequently, it may lead to a brand new picture for aggressive countries like the U.S. that the future space might not be just a long-range strategic arena, but also a face-to-face combat field. Therefore, a critical thing has to be stressed now: Do not forget that space field is full of cooperation, and it should be.

A volcano on Spain's La Palma island began ejecting lava again on Monday after a lull, while hundreds of people in coastal villages hunkered down in anticipation of lava emitted in previous days reaching the sea and releasing toxic gas.

Spurts of vivid lava emerged from the Cumbre Vieja volcano in the early evening and snaked down the dark mountainside after a period of several hours without explosions, according to witnesses.

The hiatus and new explosions came eight days after lava started pouring from the mountain range on the island, which neighbors Tenerife in the Canary Islands archipelago off North Africa. ""Activating and deactivating is logical, natural in the evolution of Strombolian volcanoes,"" said Miguel Angel Morcuende, director of the Pevolca response committee, referring to the type of violent eruption that emits incandescent dust.

On Monday, two tongues of the superheated black lava were rounding a hill to the west of the small town of Todoque, less than a kilometre from the Atlantic, but authorities said they could not be sure when it might reach the sea. Still, about 300 local residents in the coastal areas of San Borondon, Marina Alta and Baja and La Condesa have been confined to their homes as the moment of contact between the lava and the sea is likely to trigger explosions and emit clouds of chlorine gas.

1915,U.S. conducts successful test of hypersonic weapon: Pentagon,"The free-flight test of the Hypersonic Air-breathing Weapon Concept (HAWC) took place last week, the Pentagon's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) said in a statement.

The U.S. has tested an air-breathing hypersonic weapon capable of speeds five times faster than the speed of sound, marking the first successful test of this class of weapon since 2013, the Pentagon said on Monday.

""This brings us one step closer to transitioning HAWC to a program of record that offers next generation capability to the U.S. military,"" said Andrew Knoedler, HAWC program manager in DARPA's Tactical Technology Office. There is no target date for that transition, but Knoedler told Reuters, ""we are readying our next vehicles and working toward additional flight tests later in the year.""

Hypersonic weapons travel in the upper atmosphere at speeds of about 6,200 kilometers per hour.

""The missile, built by Raytheon Technologies, was released from an aircraft seconds before its Northrop Grumman scramjet (supersonic combustion ramjet) engine kicked on,"" DARPA said.

""The DoD (Department of Defense) has identified hypersonic weapons and counter-hypersonic capabilities as the highest technical priorities for our nation's security,"" said Wes Kremer, president of Raytheon's Missiles & Defense business unit.

""The United States, and our allies, must have the ability to deter the use of these weapons and the capabilities to defeat them,"" he said.

In 2019, Raytheon teamed up with Northrop Grumman to develop and produce engines for hypersonic weapons. Northrop's scramjet engine technology uses the vehicle's high speed to forcibly compress incoming air before combustion to enable sustained flight at hypersonic speeds.

""The HAWC vehicle operates best in oxygen-rich atmosphere, where speed and maneuverability make it difficult to detect in a timely way. It could strike targets much more quickly than subsonic missiles and has significant kinetic energy even without high explosives,"" DARPA said in a statement."
1916,ZGC Forum: Technology vital to achieving China's 'dual carbon' goals,"China must establish a powerful technical support system to achieve carbon neutrality, as technology is the key in the field, Ding Zhongli, a member of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said at a parallel forum of the 2021 Zhongguancun Forum (ZGC Forum) on Sunday.

""Achieving carbon neutrality needs a systematic transformation in China's economy and society. We cannot only rely on administrative or capital power but must rely on the power of technology,"" said Ding, calling building such a support system a major task for China's scientific and technological community.

Ding said the world emits about 40.1 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) annually, of which 86 percent comes from fossil fuel use and 14 percent from land use change.

Although China has been long regarded as the largest carbon emitter globally, the country sits 15th in the world in terms of per-capita carbon emissions after many developed countries, such as the U.S., Canada, Australia and Japan, according to the World Bank.

""About 46 percent of the CO2 remains in the atmosphere. Twenty-three percent is absorbed by the oceans, and 31 percent is absorbed by the land,"" he said.

Ding said to achieve carbon neutrality, the nation needs to replace traditional energy, such as coal, petrol and gas, with renewable energy, such as wind, solar, nuclear power, electricity and hydrogen power, and develop and apply new technologies to capture and store the carbon emissions.

Technologies related to carbon neutrality can range from carbon emission calculation and management to carbon capture and storage.

""We need to train more professionals who know how to calculate the carbon emission,"" said Ding.

As for carbon capture and storage, there are various methods to decrease carbon emissions, such as factories capturing the carbon dioxide before emitting it to the environment and a carbon sink to absorb the carbon emissions.

In July, China's national carbon emissions trading market commenced trading as the nation released a plan for setting and distributing carbon emission trade quotas for 2019-20 for units in the power sector last December. Carbon emission is tracked and traded like any other commodity on what is known as the ""carbon market."" When a company breaches its carbon emissions limit, it has to buy more permits. If the company emits less than the set limit, it can sell the excess permits for cash.

China pledged to reach peak emissions before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060.

1918,A Nobel Prize winner's secrets of innovation and success,"The key to innovation in a country is to give young scientists independence, good funding and allow them to make mistakes in their research, Michael Levitt, the 2013 Nobel Prize Winner for chemistry, told CGTN.

He also shared some personal secrets as a successful scientist during an exclusive interview with CGTN on the sidelines of the 2021 Zhongguancun Forum that kicked off Friday in Beijing. Known as China's silicon valley, Zhongguancun is home to many leading Chinese IT companies and start-ups.

""If you don't do something difficult, then you don't make mistakes. But if you do something difficult, you have to make mistakes. So I often tell people that a good scientist is wrong 90 percent of the time, but a really good scientist is wrong 99 percent of the time,"" said Levitt, adding that he believes in science, people learn from mistakes, not from success.

Levitt was raised in a Jewish family in South Africa. Like many teenagers, he was bored at school when he was 15 years old. He started to date girls, play snooker, consume alcohol and even smoke. His mother was worried about him. But instead of blaming him, she decided to challenge him.

""I would pay for people to teach you privately over the summer holiday. And then at the end of the summer holiday, you will write your exam to leave school,"" Levitt said recalling what his mother told him then."

1920,China's CDC chief calls for access to COVID-19 shots for all nations,"China's zero-tolerance policy against COVID-19 is based on scientific evidence, Gao said, adding that the public has shown greater understanding and engagement when decisions are science-based.

""The world needs to share the vaccines. Otherwise, the viruses will take over the world,"" Gao said.

Gao Fu, director of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), said the vaccines can provide fundamental immunity, especially effective protection against severe illness or even death, although the coronavirus has been mutating and the efficacy of vaccines may drop in the face of different variants.

Ensuring all countries of access to COVID-19 vaccines in the future is a significant strategy to prevent the spread of the coronavirus around the globe, a top Chinese expert said at a forum held parallel to the Zhongguancun Forum (ZGC Forum) in Beijing on Saturday.

A total of 315 COVID-19 vaccine candidates are in development globally, of which 194 are in pre-clinical development and 121 in clinical trials, according to the World Health Organization (WHO)'s COVID-19 vaccine tracker and landscape published on September 24.

China has 24 COVID-19 vaccines in clinical trials, of which nine have entered phase-3 clinical trials, four have been granted conditional marketing approval, two have been included in the WHO Emergency Use listing, and three have been authorized for domestic emergency use in the country, Zhang Yudong, vice minister of Science and Technology, said at the same forum.

Experts also shared the latest development of some of the homegrown COVID-19 vaccines.

Xia Ningshao, director of the National Institute of Diagnostics and Vaccine Development in Infectious Diseases at Xiamen University, introduced the country's first intranasal spray version of the COVID-19 vaccine.

Xia said the immune response can be triggered 24 hours after a single dose of the nasal-spray vaccine, which can meet the needs of rapid emergency response. The protective effect can last for a long time after two doses, and it is effective for the elderly as well.

Wei Yuquan, director of the National Key Laboratory of Biotherapy at West China Hospital of Sichuan University, elaborated on a domestically developed COVID-19 recombinant protein vaccine.

The vaccine is made from recombinant proteins extracted from insect cells, known as sf9. It has finished the first two phases of clinical trials, and the phase-3 studies are underway, said Wei, adding that vaccines produced using the insect cell expression system are safe.

""Now that the virus is mutating, vaccination has bought us time,"" said Yin Zundong, director of the National Immunization Program of the China CDC.

""One of the things we need to do next is continuing to increase vaccination rates by covering more people and monitor adverse events at the same time,"" said Yin, adding that further research is underway on vaccination in younger age groups, as well as on booster vaccination."

The latest research on bats by Chinese researchers focuses on samples collected from over 13,000 bats of 56 species across 14 provinces since 2016. /CFP

A Chinese study has uncovered 142 bat coronaviruses related to the one that caused the SARS outbreak nearly two decades ago, but none closely linked to the virus that caused COVID-19, the South China Morning Post has reported.

In a paper uploaded on the preprint server Research Square on Monday, researchers from the Institute of Pathogen Biology in Beijing revealed that they had collected and tested samples from more than 4,700 bats in regions across China since January 2020, adding to the thousands tested since 2016.

The latest research on bats, believed to be the species of origin of the virus, focused on samples collected from more than 13,000 bats of 56 species across 14 provinces since 2016.

Scientists suggest that viruses considered closest to SARS-CoV-2 are ""extremely rare"" in bats in China.

""This is the first bit of new sampling that I've seen from a well-known group of Chinese scientists on bat SARS-related coronavirus in China since the pandemic,"" the newspaper quoted disease ecologist Peter Daszak as saying. Daszak was part of a World Health Organization-led study in China earlier this year.

Leo Poon Lit-man of the University of Hong Kong called the work an important step towards helping researchers narrow down the regions and species that might harbor closer viruses."

Huawei will not give up or sell out its cellphone business, said rotating Chairman and CEO Xu Zhijun at a press conference during Huawei Connect 2021 event on Friday.

Xu said Huawei's cellphone business is facing enormous challenges due to the sanctions from the U.S. ""Nowadays it's difficult to be able to purchase Huawei-branded phones,"" Xu said. ""But Huawei will never give up on the cellphone business.""

Huawei sold its budget smartphone brand Honor last November to a consortium after months of struggle as the U.S. has cut off key chips and software exported to the company in an attempt to ease the pressure on production. The company still owns Huawei-branded cellphones fed with stocking chips.

Huawei keeps making effort in expanding its cellphone business, according to the CEO. However, it may take ""several years"" for Huawei's cellphone business to get back on track again.

""Though it's tough, at least we have the dream,"" Xu said.

In addition, Huawei's own operating system HarmonyOS has been installed in over 120 million cellphones by far. Xu estimated the number will exceed 300 million by the end of the year. All existing Huawei cellphones which can be upgraded will be upgraded to HarmonyOS, according to Xu.

Xu also commented on Huawei's choice of not launching car manufacturing business. ""How many new car brands can survive is unknown. When more players are joining the car-making business, the more we need to calm down [on the idea],"" Xu said.

Huawei repeatedly said that the company will not manufacture cars although a slew of tech companies have announced their participation in car-making businesses in recent years."

Sinovac's COVID-19 vaccine is highly effective against serious illness, a large real world study from Malaysia showed.

The study, conducted by the Malaysian government, found that 0.011 percent of about 7.2 million recipients of the Sinovac shot required treatment in intensive care units (ICU) for COVID-19 infections, health officials told reporters on Thursday.

About 0.002 percent of 6.5 million recipients of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine needed ICU treatment for COVID-19 infections and 0.001 percent of 744,958 recipients of the AstraZeneca shot required similar treatment.

Kalaiarasu Peariasamy, a director at the Institute for Clinical Research that conducted the study along with a national COVID-19 taskforce, said vaccinations – regardless of the brand – have reduced the risk of admission to intensive care by 83 percent and lowered the risk of death by 88 percent based on a smaller study involving about 1.26 million people.

""The breakthrough rate for intensive care unit admission is extremely low,"" he said, adding overall ICU admissions among fully vaccinated individuals stood at 0.0066 percent.

Mortality rate of the fully vaccinated people was also low at 0.01 percent and the majority of them were either above 60 years of age or with comorbidities.

There were differences in the demographics of the recipients of the three vaccines and it could have resulted in the different results, Kalaiarasu said.

Many of AstraZeneca recipients were in the ""mid-adulthood age"", while the Pfizer and Sinovac shots were ""very much for the vulnerable population,"" he said.

AstraZeneca recipients also accounted for a much smaller proportion of the study, which involved about 14.5 million fully vaccinated individuals and conducted for more than five months since April 1.

In July, Malaysia said it will stop administering the Sinovac vaccine once its supplies end, as it has a sufficient number of other vaccines for its program.

The Sinovac vaccine has been widely used in several countries including China, Indonesia, Thailand and Brazil, and the company said earlier this month it had supplied 1.8 billion doses at home and abroad.

Malaysia has fully vaccinated 58.7 percent of its 32 million population and gave at least one dose to 68.8 percent.

1928,Trial suggests CanSinoBIO's COVID-19 vaccine safe for children,"CanSino Biologics Inc.'s (CanSinoBIO) single-dose COVID-19 vaccine, given at a lower dosage than that for adults, is safe and triggers an immune response in children aged 6-17, results from a small trial showed.

Researchers decided to lower the dosage after a few participants developed fever and headaches graded at level 2 severity – the second-lowest of four levels. In children, the lower dose triggered higher antibody levels than the dosage approved for use in adults in China, according to the peer-reviewed finding from a mid-stage trial, conducted by dozens of Chinese researchers from the industry including CanSino vaccine developers .

The trial recruited 150 children and around 300 adults.

The results also showed that children given one lower dose had a stronger antibody response than adults who were given a booster shot 56 days after the first dose.

But the antibody readings did not show to what extent the vaccine can offer protection against COVID-19, researchers from a Chinese disease control agency, CanSinoBIO and other Chinese institutes cautioned in a paper.

CanSinoBIO's vaccine has not yet got the greenlight for children. China has approved two vaccines, developed by Sinovac and Sinopharm, for use in children from the age of three but vaccinations have yet to begin for those under 12.

The paper said the booster shot for CanSinoBIO's vaccine improved antibody responses in participants of different age groups, especially for older adults.

But cellular responses, another important part of human immune system, were not boosted by the second shot and researchers said a wider interval than 56 days should be considered."

The meeting will assess past biodiversity conservation work and set new goals for the future among its main objectives.

Eleven years ago, when COP10 was held, 20 benchmarks were set by the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity. They are known as the Aichi Targets, named after the hosting place of COP 10 – Japan's Aichi.

However, none of the targets have been fully met globally, the 5th edition of Global Biodiversity Outlook published in 2020 showed. But China is above the global average in pursuing these goals.

""China has exceeded three of the 20 Aichi targets, met almost 13 of the standards and made significant progress in another four. This means China has made progress in pursuing all the 20 Aichi targets. And this is above average by international standards,"" said Cui Shuhong, director of the Natural Ecological Protection Department of China's Ministry of Ecology and Environment, at a press conference on Thursday.

Across China, Yunnan Province is one of the leading areas in biodiversity conservation. It is one of the major reasons why it was chosen to host COP15. The provincial environment officials emphasized that the conference will be ""green"" and ""safe.""

Wang Tianxi, deputy director of the Environmental Protection Department of the Yunnan provincial government, said they have outlined a cybersecurity working plan, strengthened all epidemic prevention and control procedures, and carried out a series of emission reduction efforts.

1930,Chinese scientists synthesize starch from CO2 in global first,"Screenshot of the study from the website of Science.

Screenshot of the study from the website of Science.

Chinese scientists have become the first in the world to develop an artificial method of synthesizing starch from carbon dioxide (CO2).

The study, published online in the journal Science on Friday, was conducted by the Tianjin Institute of Industrial Biotechnology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Starch, a storage form of carbohydrate, is the major component of grain as well as an important industrial raw material.

At present, it is mainly produced by crops such as corn and rice by fixing CO2 through photosynthesis. The process involves about 60 biochemical reactions and complex physiological regulation, with an energy conversion efficiency of only about 2 percent in theory.

The new approach makes it possible to alter starch production from traditional agricultural planting to industrial manufacturing, and opens up a new technical route for synthesizing complex molecules from CO2, said Ma Yanhe, corresponding author of the study.

""The artificial starch anabolic pathway (ASAP), consisting of 11 core reactions, was drafted by computational pathway design, established through modular assembly and substitution, and optimized by protein engineering of three bottleneck-associated enzymes,"" the authors wrote.

""In a chemoenzymatic system with spatial and temporal segregation, ASAP, driven by hydrogen, converts CO2 to starch at a rate of 22 nanomoles of CO2 per minute per milligram of total catalyst, an 8.5-fold higher rate than starch synthesis in maize,"" they elaborated.

Cai Tao, lead author of the study, said that the starch sample synthesized in the new method is ""exactly the same as naturally produced starch in terms of its composition and physical and chemical properties.""

Theoretically, given enough energy supply, based on the current technical parameters, the annual production capacity of starch in a one-cubic-meter bioreactor equals the annual yield of starch from one-third of a hectare of corn, the team said.

If the overall cost of the system can be lowered to a level economically comparable with agricultural planting in the future, it is expected to save more than 90 percent of arable land and freshwater, according to the researchers.

In addition, it would also help to avoid the negative impact of using pesticides and fertilizers on the environment and ease food shortages, they said."

A lightening to USB-C cable. The EU is aiming to make the USB-C connector the standard port for all smartphones, tablets, cameras, headphones, portable speakers and handheld video game consoles. /CFP

The EU aims to have a common charging port for mobile phones, tablets and headphones under a European Commission proposal presented on Thursday in a world first, with the move impacting iPhone maker Apple more than its rivals.

The move has been more than 10 years in the making, with the European Union executive touting environmental benefits and 250 million euros ($293 million) in annual savings for users.

Under the Commission's proposal, a USB-C connector will become the standard port for all smartphones, tablets, cameras, headphones, portable speakers and handheld video game consoles.

Chargers will also be sold separately from electronic devices.

The EU executive will revise its eco-design regulation in the near future so that the external power supply is interoperable, which is the last step for a common charge.

The Commission said it was not targeting Apple and only acted because companies were not able to agree on a common solution despite a decade of talks, which have reduced the number of mobile phone chargers to three from 30.

Apple pushed back against the proposal.

""We remain concerned that strict regulation mandating just one type of connector stifles innovation rather than encouraging it, which in turn will harm consumers in Europe and around the world,"" the company said in a statement.

It also voiced concerns about the 24-month transition period for companies to comply with the legislation once it is adopted.

Commission industry chief Thierry Breton pointed to the ungainly sight of multiple charging cables.

""My job is to kill off these sea snakes whenever I can,"" he told a news conference. Breton also dismissed Apple's comments as old refrains.

""I have known these companies for years. Every time we put (forward) a proposal, they start to say 'oh, it will be against innovation'. No, it's not against innovation, it's not against anyone. Like everything the Commission does, it's for consumers,"" he said.

Researchers in Cambodia, the Philippines, Laos and France are studying samples collected from bats for possible clues to pinpoint the origins of COVID-19, according to media reports.

Eight researchers at the Institut Pasteur du Cambodge (IPC) in Phnom Penh have been collecting samples from bats in the Stung Treng province near Laos and logging their species, sex, age and other details for a week. Similar research is going on in the Philippines, according to Reuters on Monday.

Last year, researchers at the IPC did tests on two samples collected from horseshoe bats in the province in 2010, and found a close relative to the coronavirus.

""We hope that the result from this study can help the world to have a better understanding about COVID-19,"" field coordinator Thavry Hoem was quoted as saying.

Bats dwelling in limestone caves in northern Laos were also found to carry coronaviruses that share a key feature with SARS-CoV-2, according to a report by Bloomberg.

Researchers at the Pasteur Institute in Paris and the University of Laos have found three viruses with ""closely matched receptor binding domains, the part of the coronavirus's spike protein used to bind to human ACE-2, the enzyme it targets to cause an infection,"" said the report.

The researchers studied 645 bats from 46 species captured on four sites – in Fueng and Meth districts of Vientiane province, and in Namor and Xay districts in Oudomxay province – between July 2020 and January 2021.

The three viruses found in Laos, dubbed BANAL-52, BANAL-103, and BANAL-236, are ""the closest ancestors of SARS-CoV-2 known to date,"" Marc Eloit, head of pathogen discovery at the Pasteur Institute, was quoted as saying.

""These viruses may have contributed to SARS-CoV-2's origin and may intrinsically pose a future risk of direct transmission to humans,"" he said."
1935,China's tech pivot: from consumer internet to hard tech,"Chips, once considered a lonely trail for investors, are now tech darlings in China's venture capital scene. Horizon Robotics, one of the leading artificial intelligence auto chip companies, had six rounds of funding from January to July this year, with a total disclosed funding value of more than $1 billion, making it the company with the largest funding round among all the Asia-Pacific countries over that period. In 2020, semiconductor companies in China received more than 140 billion yuan ($22 billion) in investment, a 400-percent increase from a year before, according to a research report by Winsoul Capital. Investors scrambled to secure their bets and the money kept pouring in. ""We are fortunate that investors are very interested in us,"" said Zhang Yufeng, vice president of Horizon Robotics, in an interview with CGTN. Investing in chips, known for their long industrial chain and high barrier to entry, was not this popular in China until last year. Mi Lei, founding partner of CAS Star, a venture capital firm focused on hard tech investment in China, once compared investing in semiconductors to living on the moon. ""It got extremely cold in the past few years, but became very hot all of a sudden, just like the polar night was turned into polar day,"" Mi said in an interview with National Business Daily, a Chinese media outlet.

Chinese consumer internet and the 'second half of the game' For long, consumer internet companies used to get all the allure in China's tech scene. E-commerce giant Alibaba, social media behemoth Tencent and search engine leader Baidu, by pioneering innovative business models and capitalizing on the large consumer market in China, started to outrival their U.S. counterparts in size and become some of the world's most valuable companies. ""In the past 10 years, Chinese venture capitalists invested heavily in consumer internet companies, because traffic was regarded as a key driving force for growth,"" said Rao Huigang, partner at Galaxy Capital. In mid-2016, word started to go around that the Chinese internet had started to enter the ""second half of the game."" The number of internet users in China exceeded 1 billion by June this year, making it the country with the largest internet user base in the world. But the rate of growth is slowing, from a 20-percent year-on-year growth rate before 2011 to single-digit growth in recent years. ""The bonus period of consumer internet is now fully over,"" said Matthew Brennan, a China-based technology analyst. ""The lower-hanging fruits are gone, and the growth opportunities are either going international or going into lower-tier cities."" But as tech startups become industry giants, they managed to maintain their dominance by snapping up small startups in cutting-edge technology, splitting the Chinese internet ecosystem into spheres of interests and thus closing off new sectors to newcomers. In April, e-commerce giant Alibaba was fined by China's antitrust authorities for forcing merchants to sell goods exclusively on one marketplace, a practice known as ""choosing one out of two."" A number of other tech firms quickly followed suit and were asked to rectify their antitrust practices, including failing to disclose mergers, signing exclusive contracts, etc. The investigation later shifted into the realm of data, the new oil of the internet age. Investigations were conducted against Didi, Full Truck Alliance and a few other U.S.-listed Chinese tech companies for violating data security protocols. The government is now promoting higher-quality growth in China's internet sphere, asking companies to use technology for public good and refrain from monopolistic practices, said Zhang Yi, CEO and chief analyst of iiMedia Research. ""Before, it was very wild in terms of how those companies operated,"" said Brennan. ""Now it's a matter of restoring orders.""

Geopolitics and government's push for strategic industries As the rules of the game in consumer internet were reshaped, hard tech came to the limelight in China's tech sector. In its 13th Five-Year Plan, China placed innovation-driven development strategy as a top priority. Investment funds to boost the development of hard tech were established by the central and local governments. Many of the most active investors in semiconductor companies are state-supported funds, e.g. Shenzhen Capital Group and CAS Investment Management. To boost investment in hard tech, China launched the Science and Technology Innovation Board in 2019 with lower financial requirements for listing. It has attracted companies such as the chipmaker Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation to be listed in the stock exchange. Previously, because of their asset-heavy nature, hardware companies have found it hard to raise capital. But that is no longer the case because now it takes less time for venture capital and private equity funds to exit their investment, said Wang Xiaolong, research director at ICwise, a Shanghai-based market research company in semiconductor and electronics industry. More exit options are available. ""Now the acquisition market in China is starting to become active. And it has become much easier to go for IPO in China … so that gives venture capitals a very positive outlook to exit,"" said Miki Watanabe, vice president at SOSV, a global venture capital firm.

Attempts to develop the industrial internet also surfaced, with a series of policies introduced to use technology to transform China's industrial base. In November 2017, China's State Council issued a guideline on deepening the ""internet plus"" advanced manufacturing to develop the industrial internet. Given that China is moving up the value chain, there is a strong emphasis on manufacturing from the government's perspective, said Brennan. ""China has a considerable advantage in manufacturing, having been the world factory for many decades now. Keeping that advantage makes a lot of sense."" Adding to the country's push for tech innovation is a series of tech blockade that the Trump administration launched against China starting 2018. It put Huawei and ZTE on entity lists and banned investments into companies for their purported links to the Chinese military.

""We can slow down in our pursuit of the most cutting-edge chips, but we have to strengthen the foundation of the most basic technology, e.g. the manufacturing of 28 nanometer and above chips.""

1937,Chinese researchers make a breakthrough in quantum communication,"Chinese researchers have made a crucial breakthrough in quantum communication, boosting the future development of secure satellite-based long-distance and global quantum communication networks.

The research team comprising Chen Xianfeng from Shanghai Jiaotong University and Li Yuanhua from Jiangxi Normal University constructed a 15-user quantum secure direct communication (QSDC) network. The network enabled the direct transmission of confidential information among the users connected by the network for the first time.

Their study titled ""A 15-user quantum secure direct communication network"" was published in the scientific journal Light: Science and Application.

Quantum communication is a cutting-edge information technology that promises ultra-secure transmission of data. Scientists have developed many models for such transmission, including quantum key distribution (QKD), quantum teleportation, and QSDC.

Based on QKD technology, many different types of quantum communication networks have been proposed. However, such communication networks only transmit the key but do not directly transmit information.

In contrast, QSDC sends secret information directly over a secure quantum channel. Any attack of QSDC results in only a random number, and cannot obtain any useful information from it, according to the researchers.

""Therefore, QSDC has simple communication steps and reduces potential security loopholes, and offers higher security guarantees,"" they wrote in the study."

A series of previous studies showed that countries including the U.S., Spain, France, Italy and Brazil had been hit by the coronavirus before its outbreak in China. /CFP

A study published on the pre-print platform ChinaXiv, a Chinese open repository for scientific researchers, indicated that COVID-19 had started spreading in the U.S. around September 2019 ""with a high confidence probability.""

The study, conducted by researchers from the University of Science and Technology of China and the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, is based on a data and hybrid model-driven method.

By combining a mathematical model and artificial intelligence technology, qualitative and quantitative analysis of the case data of an infectious disease can reveal its epidemic law and detect its origin and development trend, they said.

""By selecting 12 representative regions in the U.S. for analysis, the dates of the first infected case with 50 percent confidence probability are mostly between August and October 2019, which are earlier than the officially announced date of the first confirmed case in the U.S. on January 20, 2020,"" the authors wrote.

Using the same methodology, the study concluded that the spread of the COVID-19 in China likely began in late December 2019.

Origin tracing is crucial for infectious disease prevention and control, and a series of previous studies showed that countries including the U.S., Spain, France, Italy and Brazil had been hit by the coronavirus before its outbreak in China, the authors wrote."
1939,J&J: Second shot boosts protection for moderate-severe COVID-19 to 94%,"Johnson & Johnson (J&J) said Tuesday a second shot of its COVID-19 vaccine given about two months after the first increased its effectiveness to 94 percent in the United States against moderate to severe forms of the disease.

That compares to 70 percent protection with a single dose.

The data will help J&J make its case to U.S. regulators for a booster shot even as the company stresses the durability of its single-shot vaccine as a tool to ease the global pandemic.

U.S. President Joe Biden is pushing for booster shots in the face of surging hospitalizations caused by the Delta variant, and J&J, the only drugmaker with a single-shot COVID-19 vaccine approved in the United States, has been under pressure to produce evidence on the effectiveness of an additional dose.

The company has now ""generated evidence that a booster shot further increases protection against COVID-19,"" Paul Stoffels, J&J's chief scientific officer, said in a statement.

J&J said a booster given two months after the first dose increased antibody levels four to six-fold. When given six months after the first dose, antibody levels shot up twelve-fold, data released last month showed, suggesting a large improvement in protection with the longer interval between doses.

Side effects with two doses were comparable to those seen in studies with the single-dose vaccine. The data is yet to be peer reviewed but will be submitted for publication in the coming months.

To date, only Pfizer Inc./BioNTech SE have submitted sufficient data for U.S. regulators to evaluate whether boosters are warranted ahead of the Biden administration's September 20 deadline for rolling out booster shots. A decision on that vaccine is expected this week.

On Friday, an FDA advisory committee voted to recommend emergency authorization of additional Pfizer shots for Americans 65 and older and those at high risk of severe illness but voted to recommend against broader approval, saying they want to see more data.

J&J said it has submitted data to the FDA and plans to submit it to other regulators, the World Health Organization and other vaccine advisory groups worldwide to inform their decision-making.

The company also said on Tuesday that evidence from a separate real-world study of nearly 400,000 people in the United States who got the single-dose J&J shot showed the vaccine was 79 percent effective at preventing COVID-19 infections and 81 percent effective at preventing hospitalizations compared with 1.52 million people of similar ages, genders and health issues who were unvaccinated.

J&J said there was no evidence of reduced effectiveness over the study's duration from March to late July – a period that included the impact of the Delta variant.

Vaccine effectiveness in the real-world study varied by age. For those under age 60, the vaccine was 86 percent effective at preventing hospitalization versus 78 percent for those 60 and older."

When three billionaires rocketed into space this summer, they did more than escape Earth's surly bonds, they helped spread ""a malady of mistrust"" plaguing an all-too-hungry world, United Nations (UN) Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told other world leaders Tuesday.

In his opening speech to the General Assembly, a grim Guterres highlighted the gap between the rich and poor with ""billionaires joyriding to space while millions go hungry on Earth.""

In July, billionaires Richard Branson and Jeff Bezos flew into space on private rockets that their companies built, gathering worldwide attention in their short trips that didn't make it into orbit. Both bank on space tourism business from their fellow space fans with big wallets.

After returning to Earth, Branson, 71, sprayed G.H. Mumm champagne over his crew and then chugged it from the bottle.

Billionaire Jared Isaacman led the first all-private orbital mission that splashed down Saturday after three days in orbit. His flight was on a Dragon capsule and Space X rocket built by a fourth space-obsessed billionaire, Elon Musk. Unlike the other two missions, Isaacman's ride raised more than $200 million for St. Jude Children's Research Hospital including $100 million from Isaacman and $50 million from Musk.

Guterres lumped billionaire space hops with the maladies of hopelessness, corruption, curtailing of personal freedoms and ""when parents see a future for their children that looks even bleaker than the struggles of today.""

After Branson and Bezos spaceflights and revelations that Bezos, the richest man in the world, didn't pay any federal income tax in 2007 and 2011, critics called for taxing billionaires with some wanting to tax them out of the 10-digit income level. So far those proposals, unlike the billionaires, haven't gotten off the ground."

1942,"Xi addresses UNGA, calls for jointly addressing global challenges","Mr. President,

The year 2021 is a truly remarkable one for the Chinese people. This year marks the centenary of the Communist Party of China. It is also the 50th anniversary of the restoration of the lawful seat of the People’s Republic of China in the United Nations, a historic event which will be solemnly commemorated by China.

We will continue our active efforts to take China’s cooperation with the United Nations to a new level and make new and greater contributions to advancing the noble cause of the UN.

Mr. President, A year ago, global leaders attended the high-level meetings marking the 75th anniversary of the UN and issued a declaration pledging to fight COVID-19 in solidarity, tackle challenges together, uphold multilateralism, strengthen the role of the UN, and work for the common future of present and coming generations.

One year on, our world is facing the combined impacts of changes unseen in a century and the COVID-19 pandemic. In all countries, people long for peace and development more than ever before, their call for equity and justice is growing stronger, and they are more determined in pursuing win-win cooperation.

Right now, COVID-19 is still raging in the world, and profound changes are taking place in human society. The world has entered a period of new turbulence and transformation. It falls on each and every responsible statesman to answer the questions of our times and make a historical choice with confidence, courage and a sense of mission.

First, we must beat COVID-19 and win this decisive fight crucial to the future of humanity. The history of world civilization is also one of fighting pandemics. Rising to challenges, humanity has always emerged in triumph and achieved greater development and advancement. The current pandemic may appear overwhelming, but we humanity will surely overcome it and prevail.

We should always put people and their lives first, and care about the life, value and dignity of every individual. We need to respect science, take a science-based approach, and follow the laws of science. We need to both follow routine, targeted COVID-19 protocols and take emergency response measures, and both carry out epidemic control and promote economic and social development.

We need to enhance coordinated global COVID-19 response and minimize the risk of cross-border virus transmission.

Vaccination is our powerful weapon against COVID-19. I have stressed on many occasions the need to make vaccines a global public good and ensure vaccine accessibility and affordability in developing countries. Of pressing priority is to ensure the fair and equitable distribution of vaccines globally. China will strive to provide a total of two billion doses of vaccines to the world by the end of this year.

In addition to donating 100 million US dollars to COVAX, China will donate 100 million doses of vaccines to other developing countries in the course of this year. China will continue to support and engage in global science-based origins tracing, and stands firmly opposed to political maneuvering in whatever form.

Second, we must revitalize the economy and pursue more robust, greener and more balanced global development. Development holds the key to people’s well-being. Facing the severe shocks of COVID-19, we need to work together to steer global development toward a new stage of balanced, coordinated and inclusive growth. To this end, I would like to propose a Global Development Initiative:

— Staying committed to development as a priority. We need to put development high on the global macro policy agenda, strengthen policy coordination among major economies, and ensure policy continuity, consistency and sustainability. We need to foster global development partnerships that are more equal and balanced, forge greater synergy among multilateral development cooperation processes, and speed up the implementation of the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

— Staying committed to a people-centered approach. We should safeguard and improve people’s livelihoods and protect and promote human rights through development, and make sure that development is for the people and by the people, and that its fruits are shared among the people. We should continue our work so that the people will have a greater sense of happiness, benefit and security, and achieve well-rounded development.

— Staying committed to benefits for all. We should care about the special needs of developing countries. We may employ such means as debt suspension and development aid to help developing countries, particularly vulnerable ones facing exceptional difficulties, with emphasis on addressing unbalanced and inadequate development among and within countries.

— Staying committed to innovation-driven development. We need to seize the historic opportunities created by the latest round of technological revolution and industrial transformation, redouble efforts to harness technological achievements to boost productivity, and foster an open, fair, equitable and non-discriminatory environment for the development of science and technology. We should foster new growth drivers in the post-COVID era and jointly achieve leapfrog development.

— Staying committed to harmony between man and nature. We need to improve global environmental governance, actively respond to climate change and create a community of life for man and nature. We need to accelerate transition to a green and low-carbon economy and achieve green recovery and development.

China will strive to peak carbon dioxide emissions before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060. This requires tremendous hard work, and we will make every effort to meet these goals. China will step up support for other developing countries in developing green and low-carbon energy, and will not build new coal-fired power projects abroad.

—Staying committed to results-oriented actions. We need to increase input in development, advance on a priority basis cooperation on poverty alleviation, food security, COVID-19 response and vaccines, development financing, climate change and green development, industrialization, digital economy and connectivity, among other areas, and accelerate implementation of the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, so as to build a global community of development with a shared future.

China has pledged an additional three billion US dollars of international assistance in the next three years to support developing countries in responding to COVID-19 and promoting economic and social recovery.

Third, we must strengthen solidarity and promote mutual respect and win-win cooperation in conducting international relations. A world of peace and development should embrace civilizations of various forms, and must accommodate diverse paths to modernization. Democracy is not a special right reserved to an individual country, but a right for the people of all countries to enjoy.

Recent developments in the global situation show once again that military intervention from the outside and so-called democratic transformation entail nothing but harm. We need to advocate peace, development, equity, justice, democracy and freedom, which are the common values of humanity, and reject the practice of forming small circles or zero-sum games.

Differences and problems among countries, hardly avoidable, need to be handled through dialogue and cooperation on the basis of equality and mutual respect. One country’s success does not have to mean another country’s failure, and the world is big enough to accommodate common development and progress of all countries. We need to pursue dialogue and inclusiveness over confrontation and exclusion.

We need to build a new type of international relations based on mutual respect, equity, justice and win-win cooperation, and do the best we can to expand the convergence of our interests and achieve the biggest synergy possible.

The Chinese people have always celebrated and striven to pursue the vision of peace, amity and harmony. China has never and will never invade or bully others, or seek hegemony. China is always a builder of world peace, contributor to global development, defender of the international order and provider of public goods. China will continue to bring the world new opportunities through its new development.

Fourth, we must improve global governance and practice true multilateralism. In the world, there is only one international system, i.e. the international system with the United Nations at its core. There is only one international order, i.e. the international order underpinned by international law. And there is only one set of rules, i.e. the basic norms governing international relations underpinned by the purposes and principles of the UN Charter.

The UN should hold high the banner of true multilateralism and serve as the central platform for countries to jointly safeguard universal security, share development achievements and chart the course for the future of the world. The UN should stay committed to ensuring a stable international order, increasing the representation and say of developing countries in international affairs, and taking the lead in advancing democracy and rule of law in international relations.

The UN should advance, in a balanced manner, work in all the three areas of security, development and human rights. It should set common agenda, highlight pressing issues and focus on real actions, and see to it that commitments made by all parties to multilateralism are truly delivered.

Mr. President,

The world is once again at a historical crossroads. I am convinced that the trend of peace, development and advancement for humanity is irresistible. Let us bolster confidence and jointly address global threats and challenges, and work together to build a community with a shared future for mankind and a better world for all."

The number of people suffering from Alzheimer's disease in China is estimated to surge to 40 million by 2050 from the current 10 million, according to the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

Tuesday was World Alzheimer's Day.

Experts say the chance of getting the disease doubles every five years. However, diagnosis and prevention in the early stages of the disease can make a significant difference for patients by slowing down its progression. The chance of getting the disease can even be cut down by half.

Younger people in China have been found to have Alzheimer's lately, but less than 40 such patients are undergoing clinical treatment, according to Wang Jun, director of the China Association for Alzheimer's Disease.

Low public awareness and lack of early-stage diagnosis hinder the country's efforts to help patients, she said. While awareness of the disease is rising in cities, people in suburban areas or villages still lack knowledge.

""We don't have a standard for early-stage diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease so far,"" Wang said.

""Caring for patients is not just about providing food and doing laundry,"" she said. ""It includes training for their brain functions."""

1946,How is 'America First' shaping U.S. vaccinations and donations?,"U.S. President Joe Biden is expected to launch a campaign to offer COVID-19 vaccine booster shots to all American adults starting Monday, while the World Health Organization called for under-vaccinated countries to be prioritized. The Department of Health and Human Services released a statement last month proposing to offer booster shots for all Americans beginning Monday, and starting with individuals who were eight months past their second shot. Food and Drug Administration advisers later recommended booster shots for Americans aged 65 and older and those at high risk of illness, after rejecting a call for broader approval. Currently, three vaccines are approved for distribution in the U.S., made by Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and Johnson&Johnson respectively. The U.S. had vaccinated 63.8 percent of its total population as of Sunday.

Why booster shots? The Biden administration is concerned about the waning effectiveness of the vaccines over time as a renewed surge in cases is driven by the exceptionally contagious Delta variant. It has pushed boosters as a way to rebuild immunity. ""We are awaiting a full review and approval by the FDA"" and advisers to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), White House spokesman Chris Meagher said.

WHO calls for delay The head of the World Health Organization has called on countries to delay giving out booster shots of COVID-19 vaccines until nations with low vaccination rates can inoculate more of their population. During a news conference last month, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus again suggested that giving out booster shots in countries with already high vaccination rates could undermine more equitable distribution in poor nations where more dangerous coronavirus variants could emerge. 'America First' vaccine diplomacy The Biden administration is busy burnishing America's global credentials. But the administration's vaccine diplomacy has been slower off the mark."

The U.S. government aims to begin offering COVID-19 vaccine booster shots next week to Americans age 16 and up. A panel of external advisers to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) voted against such broad coverage on Friday but backed a shot for people 65 and older, which the agency may or may not follow.

President Joe Biden's administration faces criticism within the scientific community over whether the additional shots are needed for the general population.

What does data say about booster shots?

Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech, as well as rival vaccine maker Moderna have each presented analyses of clinical trial data showing that the effectiveness of their shots, initially estimated at more than 90 percent against symptomatic COVID-19 infection, wanes over time.

As a result, they say, people who were vaccinated earlier on in the pandemic are now more vulnerable to so-called breakthrough infections, particularly in the face of the fast-spreading Delta variant of the coronavirus. Booster doses help restore the waning levels of antibodies produced by the original inoculation, the drugmakers have said.

Data from Pfizer's clinical trial of 30,000 people suggest that the vaccine's efficacy diminished by around 6 percent every two months after the second dose.

Moderna this week said it found higher rates of breakthrough infection among participants in its clinical trial who received its two-dose vaccine roughly 13 months ago compared with those vaccinated roughly eight months ago.

The FDA is still going to continue to look at whether to recommend a third round of shots.

""We're working on that right now to get the data to the FDA so they can examine it and make a determination about the boosters for those people,"" Dr Anthony Fauci, Joe Biden's chief medical adviser, said on Sunday.

Several other countries, including Britain, Israel, Germany and France, have decided to offer boosters to older adults and people with weak immune systems.

What is the critique?

Many vaccine experts say the data so far only suggest a need for boosters in older adults and people with compromised immune systems. The critics include two FDA scientists who resigned as the United States government announced its booster shots plan.

For example, a report from Israel's Health Ministry shows a much higher risk of severe breakthrough infection among vaccinated people over the age of 60 compared with people aged 50-59 and 40-49, even though the younger groups include people who were vaccinated more than six months ago.

Other studies in the United States show that the vaccines remain highly protective against severe disease and death in adults under the age of 65.

Aside from the actual efficacy of the booster shots, the World Health Organization (WHO) held strong grounds on calling on rich countries to halt booster shots promotion for the rest of the year.

Current data does not indicate that COVID-19 booster shots are needed, the WHO said in August.

WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said a total of 5.5 billion coronavirus vaccine shots had been administered, with 80 percent of the vaccines being for upper- and middle-income countries. He also pointed out that less than 15 percent of the 1 billion vaccine shots promised as donation by the rich countries had been actually delivered.

As of Saturday, the total number of people on the Chinese mainland who have received COVID-19 vaccine jabs reached 1.1 billion, or 78 percent of its population, the latest official data shows.

More than 2.17 billion vaccine shots have been administered in total, according the National Health Commission.

China has made ""a milestone"" that brings it closer to its goal of vaccinating 80 percent of its population by the end of the year, The New York Times reported on Thursday when the total number of COVID-19 vaccinations surpassed 1 billion in China.

""It was a significant accomplishment,"" the report added.

""The scale of China's [vaccine] campaign has put the nation multiples ahead of the rest of the world in absolute terms,"" Fortune reported on Thursday, adding that China is still implementing strict quarantine measures to contain local outbreaks.

According to Our World in Data, as of Saturday, the U.S. and Japan have fully vaccinated more than 50 percent of their populations. The full vaccination rate in some European countries, such as the UK, Germany and France, has passed 60 percent.

The World Health Organization in last November said that modeling studies under certain conditions showed about 60 to 70 percent of the population needs to be immune to curb or halt COVID-19 transmission.

Achieving herd immunity depends on vaccine efficacy and virus transmissibility, Zhong Nanshan, China's top respiratory expert, said in a virtual speech at a conference under the fifth China-Arab States Expo in August.

""The efficacy of China-developed vaccines is about 70 percent, so the country would need more than 80 percent of the population to be vaccinated before establishing herd immunity,"" he added.

The Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences (CAAS) has released a plan for promoting key subjects during the 14th Five-Year Plan period (2021-2025) to enhance the country's agricultural sci-tech innovation.

The subjects involve food security, nutrition and health, cultivated-land conservation, disease prevention and control, green development, intelligent agricultural machinery, basic research, frontier and interdisciplinary research, data resources and regional development.

By 2020, the rate of agricultural technological development's contribution to China's economic growth rate had reached over 60 percent, and the coverage rate of improved varieties of crops has reached over 96 percent, said CAAS president Tang Huajun.

The proportion of improved varieties and localized livestock, poultry and aquatic products are on the rise year by year, Tang said.

Science and technology have become one of the most important drivers of the country's agricultural economic growth, Tang added.

In the future, the CAAS will focus on developing basic scientific research issues, including biological nitrogen fixation, apomictic reproduction, pathogenesis and transmission mechanisms of animal diseases, and cutting-edge technologies, such as gene editing, synthetic biology, pest monitoring and early warning.

It will also focus on developing high-yield and high-quality grain crops to ensure national food security, Tang said."

The return from orbit followed a plunge through Earth's atmosphere generating frictional heat that sent temperatures surrounding the outside of the capsule soaring to 1,927 degrees Celsius. The astronauts' flight suits were designed to keep them cool if the cabin heats up.

Applause was heard from the SpaceX flight control center in suburban Los Angeles as the first parachutes were seen deploying, slowing the capsule's descent to about 24 kilometers per hour before splashdown, and again as the craft hit the water.

Recovery vessels were shown headed toward the water-proof Crew Dragon as it bobbed upright, nose up, in the water.

SpaceX, the private rocketry company founded by Tesla chief executive officer Elon Musk, said it should take about an hour to get the crew out of capsule. A camera shot from inside the cabin showed them sitting calmly strapped into their seats.

SpaceX supplied the spacecraft, launched it from Florida and flew it from the company's suburban Los Angeles headquarters.

The Inspiration4 team blasted off on Wednesday from the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral atop one of SpaceX's two-stage reusable Falcon 9 rockets.

Within three hours the crew capsule had reached a cruising orbital altitude of just over 585 km – higher than the International Space Station or Hubble Space Telescope, and the farthest any human has flown from Earth since NASA's Apollo moon program ended in 1972.

It also marked the debut flight of Musk's new space tourism business and a leap ahead of competitors who are also offering rides on rocket ships to well-heeled customers willing to pay a small fortune to experience the exhilaration of spaceflight and earn amateur astronaut wings."
1953,"Science Saturday: Mars rocks, space exploration, carbon reduction","In this week of Science Saturday, we look at the latest news in science and tech fields, ranging from new Martian discovery to the launch of the world's largest observatory.

Mars rocks

NASA rover Perseverance collects the first Martian rock sample. This marks the first such mineral sample obtained from the surface of another planet. Scientists say the rocks reveal a potentially habitable sustained environment, which showed volcanic activity and periods of persistent water. Two future missions to Mars are planned to retrieve those specimens in the next decade and return them to Earth where they will be examined for the first conclusive proof that life existed beyond Earth.

Space exploration

The date is set! December 18 this year. That's when NASA plans to launch its James Webb Space Telescope. It's an expensive project in the making that saw several delays. When it finally reaches its destination, it promises to offer an unprecedented look at the universe that'll help us better understand its origins and our place in it. The infrared telescope features a 6.5-meter primary mirror, comprised of 18 separate segments that will unfold once in space. James Webb will be the largest observatory ever to be put in orbit.

Carbon reduction

A factory in Iceland is turning carbon dioxide into rocks. It's the largest plant of its kind in the world. It can suck carbon dioxide out of the air. And the rocks are stored at a depth of one thousand meters underground, where they're mineralized. The estimated construction cost is around $10-15 million. The plant is capable of converting four thousand tones of carbon dioxide per year at capacity. That's equivalent to the combined annual emissions of nearly 870 cars.

Sanxingdui ruins

Chinese archaeologists restore ancient silk fabrics from the Sanxingdui Ruins site in southwest China's Sichuan Province. This is the first time that silk and textile residue has been unearthed at the site, which dates back to the ancient Kingdom of Shu, as early as the 12th century BC. Researchers say the discovery advances the origin of silk in the Sichuan Basin to over 3,000 years ago. The new findings also indicate the Shu Kingdom was one of the most important origins of silk in ancient China."

HarmonyOS, Huawei's replacement for the Android mobile operating system, has expanded its coverage from the consumer market to businesses with the launching of a new cooperation project with a coal company under China Energy to make mining faster and safer.

""The Kuanghong system, or HarmonyOS for mining, provides unified hardware and software interface to enable smart mining,"" said Zhou Zhilei, head of Huawei's coal mining division.

Huawei has claimed at various events that the HarmonyOS was initially created for the internet of things (IoT) devices instead of just smartphones, making it adaptable in IoT-heavy scenarios such as coal mines.

""The HarmonyOS is designed to fit in all scenarios,"" said Wang Chenglu, head of consumer AI and smart devices at Huawei.

A live demonstration was staged during the launching at which a manager from China Energy used his smartphone to remotely control several inspection robots in a mine.

""With HarmonyOS, we no longer need to reach for some physical buttons to get the job done,"" said He Haitao, deputy manager of China Energy's Shendong Coal Group. ""That has brought us so much convenience.""

He added that Shendong has equipped four mines with 20 kinds of IoT devices and they were working well.

Zhou Dechang, deputy head of the National Mine Safety Administration, expressed the hope that smart devices can reduce the time that miners spend underground and make their jobs safer.

Facing unfair political pressure from the U.S., Huawei is exploring different fields to expand its sources of income. And the coal mining industry, long thirsty for more automation, is among the first to reach out to the tech giant.

""It's necessary for the mining industry to adopt smart and digital solutions,"" Liu Feng, deputy head of China National Coal Association, said. ""The cooperation between China Energy and Huawei is a brave endeavor to reach for a standard of next-generation mining."""

The CMSA said that the whole process lasted about four hours, adding that the link-up is in good condition and now waits for docking with the Tianzhou-3 cargo craft and the Shenzhou-13 manned spaceship."
1956,"China's State Grid, Huawei join hands for smart EV charging solutions","China's State Grid, the largest utility company in the world, has teamed up with tech giant Huawei to develop the next-generation smart electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure to meet the fast-growing demand in the country.

State Grid EV Service and Huawei Digital Power launched their strategic cooperation plan on Wednesday during the 2021 World New Energy Vehicle Congress in Haikou City, south China's Hainan Province.

In the next three years, the two sides will complement each other's technical advantages and carry out deep collaboration in three major fields: high-power direct-current fast charging technology, user-friendly smart charging service, and internet of vehicles and big data.

The development of fast charging technology is to address one of the biggest concerns of EV car owners – that most public charging stations now refuel cars too slowly, Li Houzhi, chief operating officer of the smart charging business of State Grid EV Service, told CGTN.

Using technologies such as big data and artificial intelligence, the goal is to achieve intelligent operation and maintenance of charging facilities to improve the operating efficiency of charging station operators and promote industry upgrading, he said.

Over the years, State Grid has built the world's largest smart internet of vehicles architecture in China, connecting more than 1.4 million charging piles nationwide and serving about 9.3 million new energy car owners, he said.

Due to the accelerated penetration of EV, charging infrastructure will see major changes in the next five years, said Kuang Ping, general manager of the smart charging business of Huawei Digital Energy.

Since China set the goal to peak carbon emission by 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060, EV sales have boomed in the country. In the first eight months of 2021, new energy cars sales reached 1.8 million, almost double the same period last year.

So far, the number of new energy vehicles in China has exceeded 6 million, accounting for more than half of the world's total.

Kuang said China's current charging infrastructure has three problems: fast charging facilities cannot refuel cars fast enough, slow charging stations are not widespread enough and the deployment of charging piles is poorly planned, with some piles lying idle while many EV owners cannot find them easily.

To target these problems, industry partners need to work together to make the changes to keep up with the increasing demand of EV owners, he said.

1957,Shenzhou-12 returned: How important is the parachute?,"01:58

The three taikonauts aboard China's Shenzhou-12 spacecraft naturally get most of the attention during discussions of their historic 90-day mission. But on their return to Earth, a key piece of equipment takes a starring role: The giant parachute that softens their landing. China's self-developed parachutes have escorted all Shenzhou spacecraft back to Earth smoothly. The parachute stretches about nine floors or 70 meters from the top to the end that connects the spacecraft. That's the width of a football field.

One of the main parachutes of Shenzhou manned spacecraft. /China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation One of the main parachutes of Shenzhou manned spacecraft. /China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation

The 1,200-square-meter parachute is able to slow the craft down to seven meters per second before landing. But it's not the only chute that's deployed. ""The craft still travels at 200m/s when it's 10 kilometers above the ground. That's twice the speed of high-speed trains. It is not practical to open the main chute at that time. Let's say, on rainy days when it is windy, your umbrella can turn over,"" Rong Wei, deputy chief designer of the Shenzhou spacecraft system said. Therefore, the craft first opens a smaller chute – to slow it down to 90m/s before pulling out the main chute. At one meter above the ground, the engine at the bottom of the craft can further slow it down to a safe landing speed.

1958,China declares Shenzhou-12 mission a complete success,"The three Chinese astronauts, or taikonauts, Nie Haisheng, Liu Boming and Tang Hongbo, are all in good condition.

China announced on Friday Shenzhou-12 manned spaceflight mission was a complete success after the return capsule has safely landed in the predetermined area with the least calculation error on record at Dongfeng Landing Site in north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.

""I would describe today as perfect,"" Sun Jun, mission chief for the Space Station Project at Beijing Aerospace Flight Control Center, told CGTN. ""The entire Shenzhou-12 mission met the goals planned out for it, and this lays a concrete foundation for space station's future development.""

Wu Dawei, deputy chief designer of the Astronaut System of China's Manned Space Program said the whole system has been preparing for the day.

""The taikonauts started preparing for their trip home a month ago,"" she told CGTN at the Beijing Control Center. ""Just like going on a business trip, they put everything together nicely, making sure that all things are in good order, as the space station will run awhile unmanned.""

She said the system will continue to work and keep the returning taikonauts in good shape. ""They will have check-ups, medical protective measures and nutrition plans. The goal is to have them get back to what they were, or even in better shape than before they left. Because they may have new assignments.""

Launched on June 17, the taikonauts aboard the Shenzhou-12 spacecraft entered the Chinese space station Tiangong's core module Tianhe, becoming the first inhabitants of China's space station.

Multiple tasks have been completed during their three months' in-orbit life, which includes two extravehicular activities, Earth-space conversations and scientific experiments.

All the equipment, such as the homegrown new-generation extravehicular spacesuits and mechanical arms, as well as other support facilities, has been proved successful, and technologies like fast automated rendezvous and docking and radial rendezvous verified, laying an important foundation for subsequent manned missions.

The trio will have a week of quarantine afterwards to ensure their health due to traditional weakened immunity after a long time of in-orbit flight, Huang Weifen, chief designer of the Astronaut Center of China, told China Media Group. Then they will have a few months to re-adapt themselves to life on Earth again."

East China's Shanghai Port, one of the world's largest harbors, concluded last month with a container throughput of over 4.31 million twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs), hitting a record high for a single month and breaking the single day-night container throughput record with 158,858 TEUs on August 19, according to Shanghai International Port (Group) Co., Ltd. (SIPG). It also remained the world's busiest container port in 2020 for an 11th consecutive year with a new record of 43.5 million TEUs.

Containers are packed tightly together at the Shanghai Port, October 17, 2020. /CFP Containers are packed tightly together at the Shanghai Port, October 17, 2020. /CFP

Part of this is thanks to the Yangshan Deep Water Port. Located in Hangzhou Bay, it has the world's largest automated container terminal, which started operation in December 2017. With an area of 2.23 million square meters and a shoreline of 2,350 meters, it can handle 4 million TEUs per year. But busy as it is, there are hardly any workers to be seen there, thanks to a fully automatic management and control system developed by SIPG, which helps realize a whole-process intelligent operation, including container loading and unloading, horizontal transportation and yard loading and unloading. Connected with the major data and information platforms of Shanghai Port, the system organizes on-site production efficiently through a scheduling module and collaborative process control system. Terminal operators who used to work on site now work inside the control room, where they can do all their work in front of a computer screen. Self-developed software makes container shifting faster, easier

Shanghai was ranked in July among the world's top three shipping hubs for 2021, alongside Singapore and London, according to the Xinhua-Baltic International Shipping Center Development Index Report. And it has vowed to build a world-class international shipping center by 2025 – efficient, fully functional, open, integrated, green, intelligent and capable of providing strong support – according to its 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-2025). The automated container terminal is part of this.

It harbors seven berths and can dock container ships as large as 200,000 tonnes. ""We promise our customers that we can complete the loading and unloading of 5000 TEUs within 16 to 24 hours,"" Huang Xiusong, director of the technology center at SIPG, was quoted by Xinhua as saying. Properly arranging the transporting process requires taking every detail into consideration, such as which area a ship should dock, how much machinery is needed to unload the cargo and where it should start unloading, from the sides or the middle, Huang added. The intelligent system, developed by the team itself, has now replaced manual labor in repetitive operations. In the past, container stowage for a ship would take an experienced stowage engineer three or four hours. Now it has been reduced to 15 minutes, as the automated system can receive all the information from the moment the ship enters the dock, and automatically generate the most efficient solution that can make the whole port work together, said Huang. More sound working environment for workers The automated remote control technology has shifted operators who previously worked in the 50-meter-high bridge crane to the control room, where they remotely press a button or push a handle to control the operation based on the real-time information displayed on the screen. Without remote control technology, the terminal would need at least 700 workers. But now, only about 100 are directly involved in the remote operation of the equipment, SIPG Vice-President Fang Huaijin was quoted as saying by Xinhua.

Canada has illegally stopped Chinese captain Zhai Mo and his crew while circumnavigating their sailboat in the Arctic Ocean near Lancaster Sound, a part of the northwest passage.

The United Nations defines the ""right of innocent passage"" as a vessel's right to enter and pass through another's territory as long as it is not prejudicial to the peace, good order or security of the other state.

However, Canada always believes that is its internal waters. ""The government of Canada's long-standing position is that these are 'internal waters' and not 'territorial waters,'"" said Michael Byers, a legal scholar who holds the Canada Research Chair in Global Politics and International Law at the University of British Columbia and the author of ""Who Owns the Arctic?"".

This is not the first time Transport Canadian prohibited vessels through the Arctic water. Last year, a New Zealand sailor called, ""Canada has no legal right to apply Canadian law to a foreigner in [an] international waterway"" after being fined for entering the northwest passage by the Canadian side.

1962,China to further improve medical insurance system,"China will further improve its medical insurance system during the 14th Five-Year Plan period (2021-2025) to better meet people's demands for medical services and drugs, according to a State Council executive meeting held on Wednesday.

The meeting, chaired by Premier Li Keqiang, adopted a plan for national medical security during the period.

Acknowledging the achievements made since the country advanced the new round of medical reform, including putting in place the world's largest basic medical insurance network, covering the entire population, the meeting stressed improving the multi-tiered medical insurance system.

Support policies for medical insurance will be refined in a category-based manner, it said.

The serious illness insurance scheme will better dovetail with the basic medical insurance schemes to improve insurance benefits, according to the meeting, which also underscored improving the major disease relief mechanism for disadvantaged groups.

A mechanism will be improved where treatment is provided before the medical bills are paid in case of major epidemics, and policy measures for maternity insurance will be improved, according to the meeting.

Development of the tiered diagnosis and treatment system and medical consortiums will be advanced, and eligible medical institutions at the primary level will be listed as designated medical insurance institutions to improve medical services at the primary level, according to the meeting.

Centralized drug bulk-buying will continue to be implemented, and drugs with high clinical value and notable benefits for patients will be made reimbursable under the basic medical insurance schemes in a timely manner, the meeting added.

The meeting also underlined improving services of medical insurance handling and intensifying the oversight of medical insurance funds."
1963,China-developed vaccine enters clinical trials in Japan,"A COVID-19 recombinant protein vaccine developed by southwest China's Sichuan University has entered clinical trials in Japan. This is the first time a China-developed vaccine will undergo clinical trials there.

So far, 240 healthy people have received jabs developed by West China Hospital of Sichuan University in April last year.

""We've maintained close contact with our Japanese counterparts on whether the subjects have side effects or not, potential side effects, or immunological tests problems. We haven't seen any significant adverse reactions at this point,"" Wei Yuquan, director of the National Key Laboratory of Biotherapy at West China Hospital of Sichuan University, told CGTN in an exclusive interview.

The vaccine obtained approval from Japan's Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency in mid-August. It's made from recombinant proteins extracted from insect cells, known as sf9. The technology is believed to be one of the safest ways to produce vaccines.

Researchers believe the risk of adverse reactions is minor, as the technology has already been used in other vaccines. Companies like Sanofi have applied it to develop influenza vaccines. It can also be used to produce a cervical cancer vaccine.

""Recombinant vaccines can be mass-produced within a short period of time. It's much easier to control the quality and remove impurities. Besides this, it also has a higher level of antibodies, and its safety can be guaranteed,"" Wei explained.

The vaccine's manufacturer – WestVac Biopharma – is located in the city of Chengdu. It's jointly owned by the West China Hospital of Sichuan University and several other investors. Production was launched in June this year and can produce around 100 million doses of the vaccine a year.

The vaccine has completed the first and second phases of clinical trials in several countries. ""In addition to clinical trials in Japan, we have also conducted trials in countries like the Philippines, Indonesia, Kenya and Mexico. The number of patients admitted is very large, and we hope to complete phase three clinical trials in the near future,"" Wei told CGTN.

""Based on our laboratory data, this vaccine has been effective in coping with the Delta variant. We're confident it will be successful,"" Wei said.

According to the latest figures, over 50 percent of Japan's population has received two shots of a COVID-19 vaccine. As clinical trials come to an end in the coming months, the recombinant vaccine shots may help alleviate the country's pressure to contain the virus."

Over 1 billion people are fully vaccinated against COVID-19 in China, the National Health Commission said at a press conference on Thursday.

Wang Huaqing, chief immunologist at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said the virus is less likely to spread as more people are fully vaccinated.



""The vaccination of over 1 billion people has set a great foundation for us to fight against COVID-19,"" Wang said, ""although the virus variants have undermined the efficacy of the vaccines, which made it more challenging to achieve herd immunity.""



""We need to double down on monitoring and preventing the virus with further research and better strategies,"" Wang added.

Border areas and other regions with frequent movement of inbound personnel are encouraged to conduct regular or aperiodic nucleic acid testing for teachers and students on a pro-rata basis, according to the Ministry of Education (MOE).

The latest COVID-19 resurgence in southeast China's Fujian Province was first detected in a spot check for students by their school, MOE official Wan Lijun said at the press conference.

According to Wan, Fujian Province has implemented a nucleic acid spot check policy since October last year. The policy requires schools to spot check 10 percent of students who return to campus every 15 days so all students will be tested after five months.

""The resurgence of COVID-19 in Fujian this time was detected because of such policy in the schools. It played a crucial role in containing the virus spread,"" said Wan, adding that the ministry advocates the practice of such tests elsewhere in China.

1968,SpaceX sends all-civilian crew into Earth orbit,"After a three-day journey orbiting the globe, the four-person crew, all Americans, will splash down off the Florida coast.

A Falcon 9 rocket, with a Dragon capsule at its top, blasted off from the legendary launch complex 39A at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida.

American private space company SpaceX launched its first civilian space tourism mission named as Inspiration4, with the rocket blasting off from Kennedy Space Center in Florida at about 0002 GMT on Thursday.

The quartet of amateur astronauts, led by the American founder and chief executive of financial services firm Shift4 Payments Inc., Jared Isaacman, lifted off just before sunset from the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, and the spacecraft roared into the darkened skies.

A SpaceX webcast of the launch showed Isaacman, 38, and his crewmates – Sian Proctor, 51, Hayley Arceneaux, 29, and Chris Sembroski, 42 – strapped into the pressurized cabin of their gleaming white SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule, dubbed Resilience, wearing their helmeted black-and-white flight suits. Thumbs-up were on display as the capsule streaked into the Florida sky perched atop one of the company's reusable two-stage Falcon 9 rockets.

The Crew Dragon, fitted with a special observation dome in place of its usual docking hatch, reached orbit almost 10 minutes after the blastoff.

The rocket's first-stage booster, after separating from the spacecraft's top half, descended back to Earth and touched down safely on a landing platform floating in the Atlantic on a drone ship affectionately named Just Read the Instructions.

The flight, marking the first crewed mission to orbit with no professional astronauts along for the ride, is expected to last about three days from launch to splashdown in the Atlantic, mission officials said.

It marked the debut flight of SpaceX owner Elon Musk's new orbital tourism business, and a leap ahead of competitors likewise offering rides on rocket ships to customers willing to pay a small fortune for the exhilaration – and bragging rights – of spaceflight.

Isaacman has paid an undisclosed sum to fellow billionaire Musk to send himself and his three crewmates aloft. Time magazine has put the ticket price for all four seats at $200 million. The mission, called Inspiration4, was conceived by Isaacman mainly to raise awareness and support for one of his favorite causes, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, a leading pediatric cancer center in Memphis, Tennessee.

Inspiration4 is aiming for an orbital altitude of 575 km above Earth, higher than the International Space Station or Hubble Space Telescope, and the farthest any human will have flown from Earth since the end of NASA's Apollo moon program in 1972, according to SpaceX.

At that height, the Crew Dragon will circle the globe once every 90 minutes at a speed of some 27,360 kph, or roughly 22 times the speed of sound.

Leap ahead of rivals

Rival companies Virgin Galactic Holdings Inc. and Blue Origin inaugurated their own private-astronaut services this summer, with their respective founding executives, billionaires Richard Branson and Jeff Bezos, each going along for the ride. Those suborbital flights, lasting a matter of minutes, were short hops compared with Inspiration4's spaceflight profile.

SpaceX already ranks as the most well-established player in the burgeoning constellation of commercial rocket ventures, having launched numerous cargo payloads and astronauts to the International Space Station for NASA. Two of its Dragon capsules are docked there already.

The Inspiration4 crew has no part to play in flying the spacecraft, which is operated by ground-based flight teams and onboard guidance systems, even though two crew members are licensed pilots.

Isaacman, who is rated to fly commercial and military jets, has assumed the role of mission ""commander,"" while Proctor, a geoscientist and former NASA astronaut candidate, has been designated as the mission ""pilot."" Rounding out the crew are ""chief medical officer"" Arceneaux, a bone cancer survivor turned St. Jude physician assistant, and mission ""specialist"" Sembroski, a U.S. Air Force veteran and aerospace data engineer.

The four crewmates have spent five months in rigorous preparations, including altitude fitness, centrifuge (G-force), microgravity and simulator training, emergency drills, classroom work and medical exams.

Inspiration4 officials have said the mission is more than a joyride. While in orbit, the crew will perform a series of medical experiments with ""potential applications for human health on Earth and during future spaceflights,"" the group said in media materials.

Biomedical data and biological samples, including ultrasound scans, will also be collected from crew members before, during and after the flight.

""The crew of Inspiration4 is eager to use our mission to help make a better future for those who will launch in the years and decades to come,"" Isaacman said in a statement.

Apple has finally decided to grant users a phone with high refresh rate that has been on iPad Pros and so many Android phones since 2017.

It is a nice catch up to the new normal, but Apple's screen tech choices still offer a worse experience than competitors in many important ways.

The lack of in-screen fingerprint sensors is bringing trouble to users around the world during the COVID-19 mask mandate – you cannot unlock an iPhone with a masked face and have to enter the six-digit passcode. That's a horrible experience because it can happen dozens of times a day.

Average Android devices are now equipped with fingerprint sensor in the screen or the power button so users can easily unlock their phones with or without masks. Additionally, those Android phones also have face unlock, most of which are not as good as iPhones' but the point is they offered the option and Apple took the option away.

Another problem with iPhone screen is the lack of always-on display (AOD), which can show time, date, battery percentage and notifications 24/7 at the expense of almost undetectable battery power.

For example, your phone is now lying on the desk charging and received a message. For an iPhone, the screen will light up and fade to black again after a short while. If you didn't notice, you have to periodically reach for the phone in order to see the message. For phones with AOD, the new message icon will always be on the screen. All you have to do is a glance and everything is back in control.

With all that said, the screen is not a bad one at all. It can reach TV-level brightness and offer a resolution higher than 1080p while lower than 2k. And the new coating is unseen before on a smartphone.

Battery: Charging is still slow

It's great news Apple has again upgraded the battery size of new iPhones but only the Pro Max model has a power level on par with competitors. Considering the strong chips iPhones have and the extra heat resulted from the double layered internal design, the extra power may still not be enough to last for a day under heavy use.

The competitors are introducing super-fast charging scheme to juice up the battery in less than half an hour. But Apple only promises to charge 50 percent in the same time period with its sub-standard ""fast charge.""

The worries you already have with previous iPhone batteries will unlikely ease with the new models.

But of course, with the extra chip power, your iPhone will very likely run Genshin Impact pretty well when there's enough battery percentage left.

Pro-level cameras? Not so pro.

In Apple's advertisements, they tried hard to convince you that iPhone 13 Pro can do professional-like video recording. But as a TV professional, I'm pretty sure that a phone is still a phone if it doesn't get at least five times bigger.

When it comes to video recording, the size of the lens matters. Apple is making iPhone 13 thicker, but it's far from enough to mark it as a professional TV camera.

The iPhone can share the same video file format, but the file content will still lack behind.

The new cinematic mode is a new try to automate some professional shooting process. That's always welcomed by a lot of professionals. After all, Apple still has the corporate genes to make complicated things easier to understand.

My final verdict of the iPhone 13 series is that they aren't really worth upgrading if you're holding a 12, unless you really envy Android phones' high refresh rate and can't live without it. And for Apple fans still holding an iPhone XS, XR or even 8: Come on! Time to upgrade! It's already the second generation 5G iPhone. You should well know what ""second-gen"" mean for the company, right?

And one more thing: For most Chinese, the number 13 is not linked to anything bad. They care more about number four."

An unmanned helium-lifted airship equipped with a 5G base station has completed a test flight successfully in southwest China.

The airship aims to provide communication services for emergency rescue and disaster relief in the future.

The airship ""5G Cloud One"" flew 300 meters above ground undertaking a variety of tests in Chuxiong Yi Autonomous Prefecture in Yunnan Province – a region prone to mudslides, landslides, flooding and other natural disasters – with a payload of more than 200 kg and a signal coverage area of up to 100 square km.

It can stay in the air for over 15 days and withstand strong winds.

The airship's innovative 5G technology can effectively make up for the shortcomings of traditional communication methods in emergencies such as slow data transmission and limited coverage, said Chen Guowei, an engineer with the Yunnan branch of China Mobile.

It was developed jointly by the Yunnan branch of China Mobile, Yunnan Innovation Institute of Beihang University and Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd."
1971,"Apple's next iPhone mirrors last year's, adds more storage","Apple unveiled its next iPhone line-up, including a model that offers twice the storage available in earlier versions and other modest upgrades to last year's editions that proved to be a big hit among consumers devouring the latest technology during the pandemic.



The pre-recorded video event streamed Tuesday gave Apple a chance to present a polished story following a turbulent few weeks. The recent bumps included a hastily patched security vulnerability that could let hackers secretly take control of iPhones and other Apple devices, a backlash to the company's plans to scan iPhones for images of child sex abuse, and a federal judge's ruling that chipped away further at the competitive barrier Apple built around its app store, which generates billions of dollars in profits each year.

Like last year's model, the new iPhone 13 will come in four different designs, with prices starting from $700 to $1,100. They're scheduled to be in stores on September 24.

Possibly the most notable change in the latest high-end iPhone 13 will be an option for a full terabyte of storage – that's 1,000 gigabytes – on the device, up from its previous maximum of 512 gigabytes. That's enough storage to accommodate roughly 250,000 photos, or about 500 hours of high definition video.

Apple is also promising better cameras on iPhone 13, including an improved ultrawide lens, a cinematic-like video feature and technology for better nighttime pictures. As usual, the latest iPhones are supposed to have longer-lasting batteries, too.

""We keep making the iPhone more capable,"" Apple CEO Tim Cook boasted.

These kinds of incremental upgrades have become routine for Apple and other device makers in recent years as the pace of smartphone innovation slowed, even while prices for some phones have climbed above $1,000. That trend has prompted more consumers to hold on to their older smartphones for longer periods.

But the release of last year's iPhone 12 unleashed one of Apple's biggest sales spurts since 2014, possibly because the pandemic helped make homebound people realize it was time to get a newer and better model than what they had been using. Through the first six months of this year, Apple's iPhone sales surged by nearly 60 percent from the same time last year.

That boom has helped push Apple's stock price near its all-time highs recently, giving the company a market value of about $2.5 trillion – more than twice what it was before the pandemic began 18 months ago.

Although the iPhone is still by far Apple's biggest moneymaker, the company has been trying to supplement its success with peripheral products, such as its smartwatch. The Cupertino, California company used Tuesday's showcase to provide a preview of its next Apple Watch, which will feature a thinner, more rounded and brighter display."

The study was published in the Journal of Clinical Medicine, a subsidiary of the Lancet, on Sunday."
1973,Researchers toilet train cows to protect the environment,"This Holstein cow is going to the toilet.

As part of a research project, behavioral scientists successfully toilet-trained 11 out of 16 cows.

Even more surprising, the training was easy, according to the study senior author.

""The thing that's really surprising here is how quickly the cows learnt relative to children,"" says Lindsay Matthew, study senior author and animal behavioral scientist at the University of Auckland in New Zealand.

""So with very, very intensive training, some children can learn in a matter of a day or so. But most children, as you'll be aware, take quite some time and some days, weeks or months. And so we only had 15 training sessions with these animals and we had about, on average, 20-25 urinations, and they were fully trained.""

In just 15 days, researchers used the reward and touch of punishment system to get cows to push through a designated gate, go into an astroturf-covered pen nicknamed a ""MooLoo,"" and then urinate, not defecate.

Once their business was done, they were rewarded with a super sweet liquid of mostly molasses.

And if the cow urinated outside the MooLoo, they got a squirt of cold water.

Because of the limited time frame of the experiment, researchers gave diuretics to the cattle to get them to urinate more.

If this experiment originated from a half-joking question on a New Zealand radio talk show, the motive behind the study is very serious.

Massive amounts of urine waste pose an important environmental issue, especially in Europe, according to the researcher.

And cows do pee a lot.

A single cow can produce about eight gallons (30 liters) of urine a day, Matthews says.

When the cattle live indoors, the urine and feces often get mixed together, which produces ammonia, a gas that contributes to acid rain showers.

If the cows live outdoors, it poses another problem.

""When you have animals outdoors, the urea can get converted into nitrates in the soil and then go and pollute the waterways, cause all sorts of problems in the waterways. And also, if the nitrate concentrations are too high, you get blue babies and all that sort of thing. So, that's the direct nitrate problem in the soil. And then the nitrates get converted to nitrous oxide, which is 300 times more potent than carbon dioxide,"" says Matthew.

In 2019, nitrous oxide comprised 7% of all the U.S. greenhouse gases, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.

But the biggest environmental problem for livestock is the methane they emit in belches and flatulence, a significant source of global warming.

The experiment both shows how easy it is to toilet train other animals and how smart cows are, Matthews says.

He thinks the same techniques could be used for sheep, pigs and other livestock.

Apple Inc. is expected to show new iPhone and Apple Watch models with slight upgrades, and analysts expect that wireless carriers will play an outsized role in the annual show as they try to entice consumers into 5G plans.

Apple last year introduced its iPhone 12, which featured a new look and its first devices with 5G connectivity. This year, analysts expect modest hardware upgrades and a deeper focus on 5G.

In particular, carriers such as AT&T Inc., Verizon Communications and T-Mobile that have significantly built out their networks since the start of this year are likely to offer new incentives around the devices that can take advantage of the faster speeds those networks can offer, said Ben Bajarin, head of consumer technologies at Creative Strategies.

""There seems to be way more (5G network capacity) than was in place even six months ago,"" Bajarin said. ""They want people upgrading. They're going to be really aggressive.""

The iPhone 13, as analysts expect the new phone to be called, likely will not look much different on the outside from the iPhone 12. But analysts expect it to have a faster Wi-Fi and processor chips, and Bloomberg has reported that the top model is likely to focus on display and camera enhancements such as a ""Portrait Mode"" to blur backgrounds when shooting videos.

Analysts also believe Apple will continue the steady updates to its the Apple Watch, which has become a cornerstone of its $30.6 billion accessories segment, which was up 25 percent in Apple's most recent fiscal year even as its iPhone revenue declined slightly. Analysts widely believe that Apple users who buy more than one product – such as an Apple Watch and iPhone – are more likely to stick with the brand and spend on the company's apps and services.

Apple is likely to focus on more fitness features with the watch, which is paired tightly with Apple Fitness+, a paid service offering guided workouts with Apple instructors.

""It's the one service they offer where you literally have to have this product or you can't use this service,"" Bajarin said."
1977,Chart of the Day: The latest COVID-19 outbreak in SE China,"The new infections of the latest COVID-19 outbreak in southeast China's Fujian Province have more than doubled, local health authorities said on Tuesday. A total of 120 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 19 asymptomatic cases have been reported since September 10.

Among the confirmed cases, 75 were reported in Putian City, 12 in Quanzhou City and 33 in Xiamen City. All of the reported cases are in Fujian Province.

The COVID-19 outbreak situation in Putian City is severe, but multiple measures have been implemented to bring it under control, said Wu Haiduan, head of Putian's Xianyou County and director of the local epidemic control center, in an interview with China Media Group on Monday.

The outbreak features speedy transmission and infection among vulnerable groups of children and the elderly, Wu explained.

""The oldest that got infected is 84 years old, and the youngest is 5 years old,"" he added.

How did the virus spread?

Fujian's outbreak began in Putian, a city of 3.2 million, with the first case reported on September 10. Preliminary tests on samples from some Putian cases showed patients had contracted the highly transmissible Delta variant.

The outbreak has since spread south to Xiamen, which reported 35 confirmed locally transmitted COVID-19 cases and one asymptomatic carrier in the latest resurgence as of 11 a.m. on Tuesday, according to the city's COVID-19 prevention and control headquarters.

According to Wu, three transmission chains being closely monitored concern a patient surnamed Lin, who came back from Singapore and is suspected to be the source of the cluster. One is Lin's family; the other is the factory where his wife works, and the third is the primary school his son attends."

This navigation began about two months ago from Shanghai, east China. After passing the East Sea, the Tsushima Strait, the Sea of Japan and the northwestern Pacific Ocean, the team entered Northeast Passage on July 25 and finished around the middle of August.

However, it was not that simple to finish the northeastern part. Strong waves made everyone exhausted. Due to the midnight sun, the captain and his crew almost had no sleep, and the ship they are driving has no air conditioner to provide them a warm-enough temperature. But that's not all, they had bigger problems.

1982,"COVID-19 vaccine boosters not widely needed: FDA, WHO scientists","Additional COVID-19 vaccine booster shots are not needed for the general population, leading scientists including two departing senior U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) officials and several from the World Health Organization (WHO) said in an article published in a medical journal on Monday.

The scientists said more evidence was needed to justify boosters. That view disagrees with the U.S. government plans to begin offering another round of shots to many fully vaccinated Americans as soon as next week, contingent on approval from health regulators.

As COVID-19 cases caused by the Delta variant of the virus rise, President Joe Biden's administration is concerned that infections among those already vaccinated are a sign that their protection is waning and has pushed boosters as a way to rebuild immunity.

The WHO has argued that the vaccines are still needed for first doses around the globe.

""Any decisions about the need for boosting or timing of boosting should be based on careful analyses of adequately controlled clinical or epidemiological data, or both, indicating a persistent and meaningful reduction in severe disease,"" the scientists wrote in medical journal Lancet.

The risk-benefit evaluation should consider the number of severe COVID-19 cases that boosting would be expected to prevent, and whether it is safe and effective against the current variants, they said.

""Current evidence does not, therefore, appear to show a need for boosting in the general population, in which efficacy against severe disease remains high,"" the scientists wrote.

Some countries have begun COVID-19 booster campaigns, including Israel, providing some of the data on which the Biden administration has made its case for additional shots.

The article's authors included FDA Office of Vaccines Research and Review Director Marion Gruber and Deputy Director Phil Krause, both of whom plan to leave the agency in the next several months.

They acknowledged that some individuals, such as those who are immunocompromised, could benefit from an additional dose.

Broader use of boosters may be needed in the future if there is waning immunity to the primary vaccination or if new variants evolve so that the vaccines no longer protect against the virus, they said.

Boosters could also prove risky if introduced too soon or too frequently, the scientists wrote.

A panel of experts that advises the FDA on vaccines plans to meet on September 17 to discuss additional doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech shot, the first step in a wider booster roll-out.

The article's authors included WHO top scientists Soumya Swaminathan, Ana-Maria Henao-Restrepo and Mike Ryan.

""Current vaccine supplies could save more lives if used in previously unvaccinated populations,"" the authors wrote."

""Chinese firms have brought in investments into critical sectors, which is good for the country which is trying to attract foreign direct investment in order to support job creation,"" Phyllis Wakiaga, CEO of Kenya Association of Manufacturers said in Nairobi.

She said Chinese investors have ventured into sectors including the construction, building material, baby products, electrical goods, Information Communications Technology (ICT) sectors.

She observed that Chinese firms have helped reduce the East African nation's reliance on imports of goods.

""Goods that were once sourced from foreign countries are now being locally produced by Chinese enterprises,"" Wakiaga said.

She said that Chinese firms have also been at the forefront of technology transfer of advanced manufacturing techniques into the local economy.

""We have seen Kenya become a major diaper manufacturer in the past few years as a result of the entry of Chinese firms into the sector,"" she added.

The official added that Chinese industrialists have also benefited Kenya through linkages with small and medium enterprises."
1984,SW China launches multi-hazard early warning project,"Just as tsunamis are an inevitable threat to many coastal cities worldwide, disasters such as landslides and mudslides are inevitable in inland areas.

A multi-hazard early warning project aiming at sending advanced warnings of approaching hazards to communities ahead of disasters has been launched in Wenchuan County in southwest China's Sichuan Province.

A massive earthquake hit the area in 2008. Being the epicenter of this devastating disaster, Wenchuan County was the hardest-hit area, leading to the launch of the early warning project here.

Sensors and monitoring sites have been set up throughout this mountainous area to capture clues about the imminent seismic activities. Moreover, the devastating earthquake has loosened the soil, making the region prone to geological disasters.

The sensors can detect the danger, and satellite transmission can help transmit data in real-time to the warning center, subsequently informing people of the impending disaster.

Xu Guangjian, deputy director of Wenchuan County Emergency Support Center, is among those in charge of the warning project. He said the new system has made it possible to get warnings out quickly, giving authorities more time to evacuate residents.

He added that the Wenchuan County Multi-Hazard Early Warning System results from in-depth cooperation between the county and the Sichuan-based Institute of Care-life. The completion of the system can effectively provide them with early warning information, allowing them to study disasters and better respond to them in a timely, effective and scientific manner.

Dr Wang Tun, the director of the Institute of Care-life, took part in designing the project. He said that since all the data can be obtained from one place, the mechanism can be replicated elsewhere thanks to seismic and meteorological equipment and satellites.

""We have been concentrating on developing the technologies, and then the Wenchuan County is a pioneer project location, so we are hoping to make the system work for many other areas in Sichuan, China and for many other countries as well,"" said Wang.

""The UN has been promoting the Multi-Hazard Early Warning Systems for the world, and it has a plan to make the Multi-Hazard Early Warning Systems work for most of the countries before 2030.""

It may seem like a colossal undertaking, but as the world has learned over the years, such natural disasters can be costly if the mitigation efforts are not taken."

Yet another billionaire entrepreneur is set to ride into space this week, strapped inside the capsule of a SpaceX rocketship, as part of an astro-tourist team poised to make history as the first all-civilian crew launched into Earth orbit.

Jared Isaacman, the American founder and chief executive of e-commerce firm Shift4 Payments, will lead three fellow spaceflight novices on a trip expected to last three days from blastoff at Cape Canaveral, Florida, to splashdown in the Atlantic.

The crew vehicle is set for blastoff from NASA's Kennedy Space Center atop one of Musk's reusable Falcon 9 rockets, with a 24-hour targeted launch window that opens at 8 p.m. EDT (0000 GMT) on Wednesday. That window will be narrowed, or possibly altered, a few days before, depending on the weather.

Dubbed Inspiration4, the orbital outing was conceived by Isaacman primarily to raise awareness and support for one of his favorite causes, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, a leading pediatric cancer center. He has pledged $100 million personally to the institute.

Rival companies Virgin Galactic and Blue Origin both recently celebrated their debut astro-tourism missions. But those two high-profile flights were suborbital in scale, sending their crews of citizen astronauts to space and back in a matter of minutes.

The SpaceX flight is designed to carry its four passengers where no all-civilian crew has gone before – into Earth orbit.

There, they will circle the globe once every 90 minutes at more than 27,200 kilometers per hour, or roughly 22 times the speed of sound. The target altitude is 575 kilometers high, beyond the orbits of the International Space Station or even the Hubble Space Telescope.

The Inspiration4 crew will have no part to play in operating their spacecraft, despite some largely honorary titles, though two members – Isaacman and geoscientist Sian Proctor – are licensed pilots.

Isaacman, who is rated to fly commercial and military jets, has assumed the role of mission ""commander,"" while Proctor, 51, once a NASA astronaut candidate herself, has been designated as the mission ""pilot."" She was selected to join the team through an online contest run by Shift4 Payments.

Rounding out the crew are ""chief medical officer"" Hayley Arceneaux, 29, a bone cancer survivor turned St. Jude physicians' assistant, and mission ""specialist"" Chris Sembroski, 42, a U.S. Air Force veteran and aerospace data engineer. He won a seat in a sweepstake that drew 72,000 applicants and has raised over $100 million in St. Jude donations.

The four crewmates have spent the past five months undergoing rigorous preparations, including altitude fitness, centrifuge (G-force), microgravity and simulator training, emergency drills, classroom work and medical exams.

Inspiration4 officials stress that the mission is more than a joyride. Once in orbit, the crew will perform medical experiments with ""potential applications for human health on Earth and during future spaceflights,"" the group said in its press materials."

Chinese drugmaker Sinopharm said on Friday that its newly developed vaccines targeting the Delta and Beta variants of the novel coronavirus are very effective.

Zhang Yuntao, chief scientist of China National Biotec Group (CNBG), a subsidiary of Sinopharm, made the remarks during an aired interview with China Media Group.

The company debuted four upgraded vaccines targeting the now widespread COVID-19 Delta and Beta variants during the 2021 China International Fair for Trade in Services (CIFTIS) held in Beijing from September 2 to 7.

The four second-generation COVID-19 vaccines belong to three types: inactivated, recombinant protein and mRNA.

Among them, the broad-spectrum recombinant protein vaccine has completed phase-I and phase-II clinical trials, Zhu Jingjin, Party chief of CNBG, said during the CIFTIS.

The two new inactivated vaccines are the upgraded versions of the two vaccines developed by CNBG's subsidiary Beijing Institute of Biological Products(BIBP) and the Wuhan Institute of Biological Products(WIBP) respectively, which have been on the market since the beginning of this year.

CNBG is seeking approval from China's drug regulator for the clinical trials of the upgraded BIBP and WIBP inactivated vaccines, Zhang said. Since China has controlled the COVID-19 epidemic, and there are not many cases in the country, large-scale clinical trials of the vaccines will be conducted in overseas countries, he said.

The company will speed up the clinical trials of the vaccines in other countries to test their effectiveness against COVID-19 variants once they get approval, he said, adding that the company hopes to obtain the results of the trials by mid-2022 and promote the availability of the vaccines on the market afterward.

The existing inactivated vaccines developed by Sinopharm and Sinovac Biotech are still effective against the Delta and Beta variants, he said, citing lab experiment results and real-world data in south China's Guangdong Province and a dozen of countries, including Sri Lanka and Mongolia.

For the time being, those who need a boost dose will still get existing vaccines, he said.

But the development of upgraded vaccines targeting COVID-19 variants is to get people better prepared in the future, he said."

Companies at the meeting on Friday included Alibaba, Tencent, ByteDance, Baidu, Huawei and Xiaomi.

China's internet is dominated by a handful of technology giants who have historically blocked links and services by rivals on their platforms, creating what analysts have described as ""walled gardens.""

It is an increasingly prominent problem after the internet economy has shifted from personal computers to mobile phones, said Liu Xu, a research fellow at the National Strategy Institute of Tsinghua University.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, Tencent's WeChat and Ant Group's Alipay became the most commonly used health code scanning terminals, indicating users' dependence on WeChat and Alipay, Liu said.

""However, Tencent and Alibaba, along with Alibaba's affiliate Ant Group have formed two ecosystems that cannot be interconnected, which is not good for users. Meanwhile, it also forces other internet companies to take sides from the two,"" said Liu.

Liu said an example for the problem caused by the mutual block was that the health code of Alibaba's DingTalk could not be shared on the WeChat platform in March last year, which caused the DingTalk users to encounter difficulties in resuming work across provinces.

In July, the Wall Street Journal reported that Alibaba and Tencent were gradually considering opening up their services to each other, such as by introducing Tencent's WeChat Pay to Alibaba's Taobao and Tmall e-commerce marketplaces.

1990,"Nature congress calls for protecting 30% of Earth, 80% of Amazon","The world's most influential conservation congress passed resolutions Friday calling for 80 percent of the Amazon and 30 percent of Earth's surface, land and sea, to be designated ""protected areas"" to halt and reverse the loss of wildlife. The International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), which is meeting in Marseille, does not set global policy, but its recommendations have in the past served as the backbone for UN treaties and conventions. They will help set the agenda for upcoming UN summits on food systems, biodiversity and climate change.

Saving the Amazon An emergency motion calling for four-fifths of the Amazon basin to be declared a protected area by 2025, submitted by COICA, an umbrella group representing more than two million indigenous peoples across nine South American nations, passed with overwhelming support. ""Indigenous Peoples have come to defend our home and, in doing so, defend the planet. This motion is a first step,"" said Jose Gregorio Diaz Mirabal, general coordinator of COICA and a leader of the Curripaco people in Venezuela. Over the last two decades, the Amazon has lost roughly 10,000 square kilometers every year to deforestation, much of it through fires set deliberately to clear land for commercial agriculture or cattle grazing. This destruction combined with climate change, scientists have warned, could push the world's largest tropical forest irretrievably past a ""tipping point"" into a savannah-like landscape.

'30% by 2030' Another hotly debated measure that was accepted in a vote of IUCN members, government agencies, NGOs and indigenous people's organizations, says that 30 percent of the planet's land and ocean area should have protected status within a decade. The zones selected must include ""biodiversity hotspots"" teaming with animal and plant life, and be backed up by rigorous monitoring and enforcement, the resolution says. Many scientists and conservationists advocated for an even more ambitious ""half-Earth"" target. ""Passage of this motion sends a clear signal to world leaders that the '30 by 30' target, and respect for indigenous and local community rights, must be agreed to at COP15,"" said Campaign for Nature director Brian O'Donnell, referring to a UN biodiversity summit tasked with delivering a treaty next May to protect nature. The pace at which animal and plant species are going extinct is 100 to 1,000 times the normal ""background"" rate, a widely accepted threshold for the kind of mass-extinction event that has only occurred five times in the last half-billion years.

Deep-sea mining The IUCN's 1,400 members overwhelmingly approved a resolution recommending a moratorium on deep sea mining and reform of the International Seabed Authority (ISA), an intergovernmental regulatory body. Industry argued that the unattached rocks on the ocean floor some five kilometers below the waves are a greener source of minerals, manganese, cobalt, nickel, needed to build electric vehicle batteries. But scientists counter that seabed ecosystems at that depth are fragile, and could take decades or longer to heal once disrupted. The measure passed with more than 80 percent of votes from government agencies, and 90 percent support from NGOs and civil society groups. ""The resounding Yes in support for a global freeze on deep seabed mining is a clear signal that there is no social licensee to open the deep seafloor to mining,"" said Jessica Battle, lead of WWF's Deep Sea Mining Initiative.

Climate change commission? The major drivers of species decline and extinction are habitat loss, hunting for food, poaching for animal parts, invasive species and environmental pollution. But climate change is starting to loom large as a threat to wildlife, leading members to vote in a motion for the creation of a climate change commission within the IUCN. The aim is to ""bring together the world's experts on climate change to help shape the agenda around species,"" said Craig Hilton-Taylor, head of the IUCN's Red List Unit. ""The climate and biodiversity emergencies are not distinct, but two aspects of one crisis,"" a draft version of the congress's final manifesto said.

Programmed extinction On Friday, following intense and prolonged debate, the congress endorsed a motion on ""synthetic biology"", an umbrella term for genetic engineering, that tilts towards those in favor of more research and experimentation. One technology in particular that causes local extinction of a species, called gene drive, has divided conservationists. Proponents say it is the best tool available to fight invasive species of rodents, snakes and mosquitos that have already wiped out dozens of species of birds and other vertebrates on island habitats. Opponents fear genetically modified animals could find their way to other continents, or share mutated genes with other species. ""There are obvious ecological risks and concerns regarding genetic modification of wild species"", said Ricarda Steinbrecher, a geneticist working with the NGO Pro Natura. (Cover image via CFP.)

1991,China's efforts in offshore wind power crucial for carbon neutrality,"Hailing offshore wind with ""the biggest growth potential of any renewable energy technology,"" the report said a total of 35 GW capacity has been installed worldwide currently, saving 62.5 million tonnes of CO2 emissions.

By the end of 2020, eight coastal provinces in China had offshore wind power projects connected to the grid, contributing to an installed capacity of about 9 GW, making China the world's second for offshore wind power installations after the UK.

The global offshore wind industry installed 6.1 gigawatts (GW) of capacity last year, while China added over 3 GW last year, accounting for half of the global tally, said the council's flagship report titled ""Global Offshore Wind Report 2021."" The Netherlands with nearly 1.5 GW and Belgium with 706 megawatts (MW) were the next two countries to follow.

According to a report released by the Global Wind Energy Council on Thursday, China led the world in new offshore wind installations in 2020, for the third year in a row.

Among China's arduous efforts to honor its commitment to peaking carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by 2030 and achieving carbon neutrality by 2060, developing offshore wind power, one of the key technologies to meet the goals, is of great significance.

China, with continuous breakthroughs in relevant equipment and technologies as well as decreasing costs, has stepped on a rapid development track for the sector.

In east China's Zhejiang Province, an offshore wind farm in the Zhoushan City initiated the province's offshore wind power deployment.

The construction of the wind farm, named Guodian Zhoushan Putuo No. 6 Offshore Wind Farm, started in 2017.

After over two years' of construction, all the 63 wind turbines went into operation, with a capability of generating over 7 million kilowatt-hours of electricity per year for nearly 350,000 households, equivalent to the power created by burning 240,000 tonnes of standard coal, cutting about 700,000 tonnes of carbon emissions annually.

With abundant wind power resources, Zhoushan has also harbored several other offshore wind power farms.

Located near the Zhoushan Islands is one called Daishan No. 4 Wind Farm, which was commissioned and connected to the grid in May this year.

It will form the province's largest group of offshore wind farms with another two wind farms namely Shengsi No. 5 and No. 6, bringing the total wind power generation in the area to 1.44 billion kilowatt-hours once fully operational.

Owned by the China General Nuclear Power Corporation, the Daishan No. 4 Wind Farm comprises 54 wind turbines, with a total installed capacity of 234 MW. It is able to supply 618 million kilowatt-hours of electricity to the power grid a year.

""Compared with a coal-powered plant of the same size, the wind farm helps cut 170,000 tonnes of coal and reduce 470,000 tonnes of harmful gas and dust,"" Zhao Wen, director of the Daishan wind farm, told CGTN in an interview.

The clean energy will be used to support the development of the oil and gas businesses in Zhoushan, which will play a significant role in optimizing local energy structure, saving energy and reducing emissions, said the Zhoushan Municipal Development and Reform Commission.

The offshore wind power sector has been one of the focuses in Zhejiang Province's 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-2025 (FYP)), which plans to add 4.5 GW of offshore wind power during the period with more projects completed.

Zhang Jianhua, director of China's National Energy Administration, said the 14th FYP is the first five-year period and a critical period for the transition to low-carbon energy before hitting peak emissions by 2030.

""By 2030, the share of non-fossil energy in primary energy consumption should reach around 25 percent, and the total installed capacity of wind power and solar energy should reach over 1,200 GW,"" said Zhang. ""These two goals are daunting but we must achieve them.""

1992,BRICS nations continue to join forces to tackle climate change,"BRICS nations - comprising Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa - are joining forces for continuous collaborations in the face of deteriorating climate changes and the ongoing pandemic challenges.

Bhupender Yadav, India's Union Minister for Environment, said BRICS countries can play a very significant role in addressing the contemporary global challenges of climate change, biodiversity loss, air pollution and marine plastic litter, at the 7th BRICS Environment Ministerial Meet 2021.

""BRICS countries being the hotspots for biodiversity can tell the world how we have been conserving such mega diversity since time immemorial,"" the minister was quoted saying by Indian media.

In August, space agencies of BRICS countries signed an agreement on sharing remote sensing satellite data to help cope with climate changes and major disasters and in environmental protection.

The agreement enables BRICS space agencies to jointly build a ""virtual constellation of remote sensing satellites,"" which works as a data sharing mechanism, according to China National Space Administration (CNSA).

The satellites include CBERS-4, jointly developed by Brazil and China, Russia's Kanopus-V type, India's Resourcesat-2 and 2A, as well as China's Gaofen-6, and Ziyuan III 02. Ground stations located in Cuiaba of Brazil, Moscow Region of Russia, Shadnagar–Hyderabad of India, Sanya of China and Hartebeesthoek of South Africa will receive data from the said satellites.

At the end of August, the five countries also jointly released the ""New Delhi Statement on Environment"" at the 7th BRICS Environment Ministerial Meet 2021, uniting the nations in taking concrete collective actions on climate change, ahead of the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26) in November and UN Convention on Biological Diversity (COP15) this October.

At the conference, India also shared its own renewable energy target and plans in fields such as renewable energy, sustainable habitats, creating carbon sinks, transition to sustainable transport, etc.

As one of the BRICS countries, China has also set up its goal to act on climate challenges. In December last year, China pledged to peak carbon dioxide emissions by 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060.

Six BRICS Environment Ministerial meets have been held so far as a slew of initiatives - such as cooperation on clean rivers, sustainable cities, environmentally friendly technologies, biodiversity and waste management - have already been launched to improve the environment."

The U.S. Treasury Department met with a number of industry participants this week to quiz them about the risks and benefits posed by stablecoins – a rapidly growing type of cryptocurrency, the value of which is pegged to traditional currencies, according to three people with direct knowledge of the meetings.

Washington policymakers are alarmed at the rapidly expanding cryptocurrency market which exceeded a record $2 trillion in April. As of Friday, the market cap of stablecoins stood at roughly $125 billion, according to industry data site CoinMarketCap. It is unclear which financial regulations apply to these relatively new products.

U.S. financial regulators are working to understand the risks and opportunities posed by cryptocurrencies to the traditional U.S. financial system and plan to issue a number of reports on the subject in coming months, they said.

In July, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said the government must move quickly to establish a regulatory framework for stablecoins.

In a sign those efforts are gathering pace, Treasury officials this week met with financial industry executives to discuss potential stablecoin regulation, the three sources said.

Two of the people said that in meetings this week, one of which took place on Friday, officials asked whether stablecoins would require direct oversight if they become extremely popular. They also discussed how regulators should try to mitigate the risks of too many people trying to cash in their stablecoins at the same time, and whether major stablecoins should be backed by traditional assets.

Officials also asked about how stablecoins should be structured, how they could be used, whether the current regulatory framework is sufficient, and other safety and soundness issues, one of the people said.

Treasury officials also met earlier in the week with a group of banks and credit unions to discuss similar issues, another of the people said. Treasury officials appeared to be gathering information and did not share their thinking on how stablecoins should be regulated, this person added.

The information gathered at this week's meetings is likely to help shape a broad Treasury report on stablecoins expected in the coming months.

In a statement, Treasury spokesman John Rizzo said the department is examining ""potential benefits and risks of stablecoins for users, markets, or the financial system.""

""As this work continues, the Treasury Department is meeting with a broad range of stakeholders, including consumer advocates, members of Congress and market participants,” he added.

Washington policymakers worry the rise in privately-operated currencies could undermine their control of the financial and monetary systems, increase systemic risks, promote financial crime, and hurt investors.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency are also working on cryptocurrency projects, they have said."

Three U.S. studies suggest COVID-19 vaccines offer strong protection against hospitalization and death, even in the face of the highly transmissible Delta variant, but vaccine protection appears to be waning among older populations, especially among those 75 and older.

U.S. data on hospitalization from nine states during the period when the Delta variant was dominant also suggests that the Moderna vaccine was more effective at preventing hospitalizations among individuals of all ages than vaccines from BioNTech-Pfizer or Johnson & Johnson.

In that study of more than 32,000 visits to urgent care centers, emergency rooms and hospitals, Moderna's vaccine was 95 percent effective at preventing hospitalization compared with 80 percent for Pfizer and 60 percent for J&J.

Overall, the findings, released on Friday in the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's weekly report on death and disease show that vaccines continue to offer strong protection from COVID-19."
1995,Macao pledges to advance work on in-depth cooperation zone in Hengqin,"Ho Iat Seng, chief executive of the Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR), said Friday that the SAR government would advance work for building the Guangdong-Macao in-depth cooperation zone in Hengqin in a pragmatic and orderly manner.

The general plan for building the cooperation zone in Hengqin, issued by the Communist Party of China Central Committee and the State Council, was made public on September 5, 2021.

Hengqin is an area located in the southern part of Zhuhai city in south China's Guangdong Province, just across Macao.

Ho said at a press conference that the building of the cooperation zone is of great significance to promoting Macao's appropriate economic diversification, facilitating Macao residents' living and working in Hengqin, pushing for the quality development of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area and enriching the practice of ""One Country, Two Systems.""

""It is also a major move to promote Macao's better integration into overall national development,"" he told reporters.

Ho said the Macao SAR government has been in close contact with the Guangdong provincial government and the Zhuhai municipal government seeking quality development of the cooperation zone in Hengqin.

The governments have after talks reached agreement on the institutional structure in the cooperation zone, Ho said, adding that the SAR government has appointed young, capable civil servants to the cooperation zone's executive body.

The Macao SAR government will thoroughly study the plan and make arrangements for its future work accordingly, said Ho.

The SAR government will pool together resources to help various sectors in Macao to capitalize on the favorable policies made by the central authorities, boosting Macao's appropriate economic diversification, Ho said.

He also promised that the SAR government would create a living environment in Hengqin similar to Macao that is agreeable for either dwelling or working, just as the plan requires, so as to expand Macao residents' quality living space.

The SAR government will also seek innovations in improving the mechanism of extensive consultation, joint construction, joint management and shared benefits between Guangdong and Macao, promoting new practices and trials for the principle of ""One Country, Two Systems,"" added Ho.

The chief executive said priority will be given to developing industries of health, modern finance, hi-tech, exhibitions and trade, and culture and sports in the Hengqin cooperation zone, starting with the research and development of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM).

The central authorities' upgraded preferential policies on fiscal taxation will help attract high-quality businesses to Hengqin and invigorate the market, he said.

""In the future, we will continue to promote mutual access of infrastructure in the cooperation zone to gradually link it with Macao's public service and social security systems covering education, medical care and social services,"" Ho said, pledging to combine Macao's unique advantages in ""One Country, Two Systems"" and as a separate customs territory and an international free trade port with Hengqin's advantages in space and resources."

The U.S. has seen a resurgence in COVID-19 infections with over 4.29 million new cases and 35,283 deaths in the past 28 days, bringing its tally to nearly 40.9 million cases and 659,000 deaths in total, according to the latest data from Johns Hopkins University on Saturday.

A summer that began with plunging caseloads and real hope that the worst of COVID-19 had passed ""is ending with soaring death counts, full hospitals and a bitter realization that the coronavirus is going to remain a fact of American life for the foreseeable future,"" the New York Times reported recently.

""The irony is that things got so good in May and most of June that all of us, including me, were talking about the end game,"" John Swartzberg, an infectious disease specialist at the University of California, Berkeley, was quoted as saying. ""We started to enjoy life again. Within a very few weeks, it all came crashing down.""

The resurgence of the pandemic has left the country ""exhausted, nervous and less certain than ever about when normalcy might return,"" according to the NYT.

Mu variant of COVID-19 in 49 U.S. states

While busying fighting off the Delta variant, the U.S. is among the countries also threatened by a new virus variant.

The Mu variant of coronavirus detected in Colombia, has spread to 49 U.S. states, leaving Nebraska the only U.S. state yet to report a case of it, according to data from GISAID.

Mark Rupp, chief of the University of Nebraska Medical Center's Division of Infectious Diseases, said the Mu variant is undoubtedly already in Nebraska, but hasn't been formally defined due to gaps in testing, reported the Nebraska Public Media.

The World Health Organization says it is closely monitoring the Mu variant, which it has listed as a ""variant of interest"" because it may be able to evade immunity provided by vaccines and antibodies."

A Martian rock dubbed ""Rochette"" that provided NASA's Perseverance rover its first two samples. /CFP

The six-wheeled robot collected its first sample, dubbed ""Montdenier"" on September 6, and its second, ""Montagnac"" from the same rock on September 8.

""It looks like our first rocks reveal a potentially habitable sustained environment,"" said Ken Farley, project scientist for the mission, in a statement Friday. ""It's a big deal that the water was there for a long time.""

NASA's Perseverance Mars rover has now collected two rock samples, with signs that they were in contact with water for a long period of time boosting the case for ancient life on the red planet.

Both samples, slightly wider than a pencil in diameter and about six centimeters long, are now stored in sealed tubes in the rover's interior.

A first attempt at collecting a sample in early August failed after the rock proved too crumbly to withstand Perseverance's drill.

The rover has been operating in a region known as the Jezero Crater, just north of the equator and home to a lake 3.5 billion years ago, when conditions on Mars were much warmer and wetter than today.

The rock that provided the first samples was found to be basaltic in composition and likely the product of lava flows.

Volcanic rocks contain crystalline minerals that are helpful in radiometric dating.

This in turn could help scientists build up a picture of the area's geological history, such as when the crater formed, when the lake appeared and disappeared, and how climate changed over time.

""An interesting thing about these rocks as well is that they show signs for sustained interaction with groundwater,"" NASA geologist Katie Stack Morgan told a press conference.

The scientists already knew the crater was home to a lake, but couldn't rule out the possibility that it had been a ""flash in the pan"" with floodwaters filling up the crater for as little as 50 years.

Now they are more certain groundwater was present for much longer.

""If these rocks experienced water for long periods of time, there may be habitable niches within these rocks that could have supported ancient microbial life,"" added Stack Morgan.

The salt minerals in the rock cores may have trapped tiny bubbles of ancient Martian water.

""Salts are great minerals for preserving signs of ancient life here on Earth, and we expect the same may be true for rocks on Mars,"" added Stack Morgan.

NASA is hoping to return the samples to Earth for in-depth lab analysis in a joint mission with the European Space Agency sometime in the 2030s."

Virgin Galactic Holdings Inc. on Friday flagged a delay to its first commercial research mission with the Italian Air Force to mid-October due to a potential manufacturing defect.

The company also attributed the delay in the mission, named ""Unity 23,"" to the pending resolution of a probe by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).

Virgin Galactic said on Friday a third-party supplier warned of a potential manufacturing defect in a component of the flight control system during test flight preparations.

""At this point, it is not yet known whether the defect is present in the company's vehicles and what, if any, repair work may be needed,"" the company said, adding it was conducting inspections with the vendor.

The mission was initially set for late September or early October to carry three paying crew members from the Italian Air Force and the Rome-based government agency National Research Council.

The FAA is investigating the flight that took billionaire Richard Branson to space in July, and last week barred SpaceShipTwo flights until the agency approves the final mishap report or determines the issues do not affect public safety."

The summit will take place both online and offline, themed with ""Towards a New Era of Digital Civilization – Building a Community with a Shared Future in Cyberspace"", said Zhao Zeliang, vice minister of the Cyberspace Administration of China.

About 2,000 participants will exchange insights at the summit, including representatives from domestic and foreign governments, international organizations, industry agencies, global tech enterprises, university think tanks and research institutes.

Twenty sub-forums will be set up covering not only main topics such as cyberspace regulations and global collaborations, but also hot trends such as 5G technology, artificial intelligence, data and algorithms, as well as governance on data, charity in digital ages and communications in the COVID-19 era.

The summit attracted over 300 top tech enterprises to showcase their latest smart technologies and tech products that have changed the way of people's living and working in diverse aspects.

2001,U.S. virus origins report useless against pandemic,"The investigation report on the coronavirus origins released by the United States is of no help in the global fight against the COVID-19 pandemic as it only tries to apportion blame on China, said Raphael Tuju, Secretary-General of Kenya's Jubilee Party, in an interview with China Central Television.

Tuju made the remarks Wednesday following the United States' release of an unclassified summary of the intelligence community's assessment on the origins of the virus in late August.

Tuju slammed the politicization of origins tracing research, highlighting that it only derails joint global efforts that are necessary to effectively curb the pandemic.

""First of all, I think that sort of report is useless and it does not help in the fight against COVID-19, or any other pandemic that may surface. We hear these kind of statements trying to apportion blame to China. And everything points at the possibility that this thing could have come from the United States itself,"" said Tuju.

He said that China has done well in helping other countries against the pandemic, and China can share its experiences in the fight against COVID-19 to the rest of the world, especially the African countries that are in great need.

Many governments and experts have spoken up against the politicization of COVID-19 origins tracing and called for science-based approaches.

The South African Students Congress (SASCO), which represents students and schools, on Tuesday, slammed the manner in which the COVID-19 origins tracing have been conducted.

Bamanye Matiwane, President of SASCO, said that they oppose politicizing the origins tracing of the virus.

They recognize the joint study report by China and World Health Organization on tracing the virus origins, which clearly concluded that a lab leak of COVID-19 is ""extremely unlikely,"" he said.

""The attack on China propagated by the U.S. is unwarranted and significantly undermines the efforts of many men and women, who are out there working day and night to ensure that we get the real origins of the virus,"" he added.

Iran has also expressed its opposition to the politicization of the virus origins tracing.

Saeed Khatibzadeh, spokesman of Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said on Monday that it is unfortunate that the U.S. and some Western countries are politicizing the virus origins.

""The worst thing about the coronavirus is to politicize its origins and its various dimensions,"" Khatibzadeh said."

2004,Biden unveils sweeping new COVID-19 rules,"U.S. President Joe Biden on Thursday announced sweeping new federal vaccine requirements affecting as many as 100 million Americans in an all-out effort to increase COVID-19 vaccinations and curb the surging Delta variant.

Speaking at the White House, Biden sharply criticized the roughly 80 million Americans who are not yet vaccinated, despite months of availability and incentives.

“We’ve been patient. But our patience is wearing thin, and your refusal has cost all of us,” he said, all but biting off his words. The unvaccinated minority “can cause a lot of damage, and they are.”

The expansive rules mandate that all employers with more than 100 workers require them to be vaccinated or test for the virus weekly, affecting about 80 million Americans. And the roughly 17 million workers at health facilities that receive federal Medicare or Medicaid also will have to be fully vaccinated.

Biden is also signing an executive order to require vaccination for employees of the executive branch and contractors who do business with the federal government — with no option to test out. That covers several million more workers.

Biden announced the new requirements in a Thursday afternoon address from the White House as part of a new “action plan” to address the latest rise in coronavirus cases and the stagnating pace of COVID-19 shots that has raised doubts among the public over his handling of the pandemic.

In addition to the vaccination requirements, Biden moved to double federal fines for airline passengers who refuse to wear masks on flights or to maintain face covering requirements on federal property in accordance with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines.

Biden announced that the federal government will work to increase the supply of virus tests, and that the White House has secured concessions from retailers including Walmart, Amazon, and Kroger to sell at-home testing kits at cost beginning this week.

The administration was also sending additional federal support to assist schools in safely operating, including additional funding for testing. And Biden will call for large entertainment venues and arenas to require vaccinations or proof of a negative test for entry.

The requirement for large companies to mandate vaccinations or weekly testing for employees will be enacted through a forthcoming rule from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration that carries penalties of $14,000 per violation, an administration official said. The White House did not immediately say when it would take effect, but said workers would have sufficient time to get vaccinated.

The rule would also require that large companies provide paid time off for vaccination.

More than 177 million Americans are fully vaccinated against the coronavirus, but confirmed cases have shot up in recent weeks to an average of about 140,000 per day with on average about 1,000 deaths, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Most of the spread — and the vast majority of severe illness and death — is occurring among those not yet fully vaccinated. So-called breakthrough infections in vaccinated people occur, but tend to be far less dangerous.

Officials are aiming to administer booster shots about eight months after the second dose of the two-dose vaccines.

The BRICS countries have been cooperating and actively communicating with each other in the fight against COVID-19. /CFP

The BRICS countries, namely Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, have been actively communicating and cooperating with each other in the fight against COVID-19, according to a news article posted on the website of the Chinese government on Thursday.

The story, first published on The People's Daily Overseas Edition, listed the achievements by governments of the BRICS countries in the ongoing pandemic.

As early as April 2020, the countries exchanged information on COVID-19 through an extraordinary meeting of BRICS foreign ministers.

At the time, the countries realized that the pandemic does not recognize any national border and can only be solved through global cooperation.

Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi also thanked the other BRICS countries for their help, saying China will never forget their valuable support and aid during the most difficult period of the country's fight against COVID-19.

Health ministries and experts of the BRICS countries also held meetings in May 2020 to share experiences of monitoring and controlling the disease.

The BRICS countries also have deep cooperation in the development of COVID-19 vaccines.

Chinese enterprises worked with their Russian and Brazilian partners to conduct phase-3 trials of vaccines.

Additionally, China established a national center as part of the BRICS Vaccine Research and Development Center in May 2021 to boost vaccine research.

""There is more vaccine cooperation between BRICS countries than developed countries,"" said Wang Wen, executive dean of Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies, Renmin University of China, in an interview with The People's Daily.

On tracing the origins of the pandemic, the BRICS countries voiced support for multilateralism and the leading role of the World Health Organization.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said in June that the origins tracing should not be politicized, TASS news agency reported.

""If anyone has additional questions, they should be discussed with other countries within the World Health Organization,"" he said.

2006,China to donate 100m more COVID vaccine doses to developing countries,"China will donate an additional 100 million COVID-19 vaccine doses to developing countries this year, Chinese President Xi Jinping announced on Thursday at the 13th BRICS summit.

China last month promised to provide 2 billion COVID-19 vaccine doses to the world throughout this year and donate $100 million to COVAX, the global vaccine sharing scheme initiated by the World Health Organization. The fund will mainly go to the distribution of vaccine doses to developing countries.

To date, the country has provided more than 1 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines to over 100 countries and international organizations. The government will strive to fulfill the 2 billion vaccine doses pledge by the end of this year, Xi said while calling for strengthening international cooperation on vaccines in the spirit of equitable access for all.

At present, the coronavirus pandemic is still wreaking havoc around the world. As a result, the road to global recovery remains bumpy and tortuous, Xi said, calling for BRICS countries to step forward and advance the building of a community with a shared future for mankind.

""We need to promote global solidarity against COVID-19, join forces to tackle the pandemic, uphold a science-based approach to tracing its origins, and oppose politicization and stigmatization,"" he said.

""We need to enhance coordination in COVID prevention, control, boost the research, production and equitable distribution of vaccines as a global public good,"" he added.

He called on BRICS countries to strengthen public health cooperation in the spirit of solidarity, step up political responsibility, support each other's COVID response, and share relevant information and COVID control experience.

He said practical cooperation on vaccines is needed among BRICS countries, including joint research and production and mutual recognition of standards, and facilitate an early launch of the BRICS Vaccine R&D Center in virtual format.

He noted that it is also essential to strengthen cooperation on traditional medicine to develop more tools against the virus."
2007,China's first mRNA vaccine plant to start operation in October,"China's first mRNA COVID-19 vaccine production plant will become operational in October, local media reported Wednesday.

Located in Yuxi, southwest China's Yunnan Province, the facility can produce 200 million doses of mRNA vaccine annually.

The plant will produce mRNA vaccine – ARCoV – jointly developed by the People's Liberation Army (PLA) Academy of Military Sciences, Suzhou Abogen Biosciences and Walvax Biotechnology.

The ARCoV uses the same advanced mRNA technique as the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, both of which have an efficacy of around 95 percent, the highest among all approved COVID-19 vaccines.

The phase I and II clinical trials of the Chinese vaccine conducted in China showed it's ""fully comparable with two overseas mRNA vaccines,"" Ying Bo, founder of Suzhou Abogen Biosciences, told China National Radio in April.

Mexico and Indonesia have approved the vaccine for large-scale phase III trials. The trials will also test its effectiveness against the severely transmissible Delta variant, Walvax Biotechnology announced on September 1.

As the core raw materials of the vaccine and key manufacturing equipment have been developed in China, the production capacity at the plant can be expanded quickly.

ARCoV vaccines could be stored at room temperature for over a week and for a longer time at 4 degrees Celsius, which means a relatively low cost for its storage and transportation.

In comparison, the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine had to be shipped at ultra-low freezing temperatures between minus 80 and minus 20 degrees Celsius. It could only be kept in a standard freezer at minus 20 degrees Celsius for two weeks. Moderna's mRNA vaccine must be shipped at minus 20 degrees Celsius."

Hundreds of millions of children in South Asia are suffering because their schools have been closed because of the coronavirus but they lack online devices and connections for remote learning, the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) said on Thursday.

Authorities should prioritize the safe reopening of schools because even before the pandemic, almost 60 percent of children in the densely populated region were unable to read and understand a simple text by the age of 10, the UN body said.

""School closures in South Asia have forced hundreds of millions of children and their teachers to transition to remote learning in a region with low connectivity and device affordability,"" said George Laryea-Adjei, UNICEF's regional director for South Asia.

""Even when a family has access to technology, children are not always able to access it. As a result, children have suffered enormous setbacks in their learning journey.""

The repeated school closures since last year had affected 434 million children in South Asia and a substantial proportion of them were learning significantly less compared with pre-pandemic levels, UNICEF said in a report based on research in India, the Maldives, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.

In India, 80 percent of children aged 14-18 reported lower levels of learning than when physically at school. In Sri Lanka, 69 percent of parents of primary-school children said that their children were learning less or a lot less.

In Pakistan, 23 percent of younger children did not have access to any device for remote learning. In India, 4 percent of children between the ages of 6 and 13 reported no remote learning during school closures.

""The safe reopening of schools must be considered an utmost priority for all governments,"" said George Laryea-Adjei.

Indian epidemiologists and social scientists have asked authorities to reopen classes for all children, saying the benefits outweigh the risks, especially as poor, rural children are missing out on online education.

South Asia, with nearly 2 billion people, has reported more than 37 million coronavirus infections and more than 523,000 deaths."
2009,China adds 268 plants to state protection list,"China announced its amended national list of protected wild plants on Wednesday. There are 455 species of wild plants on the new list, including 54 first-class and 401 second-class protected plants, according to National Forestry and Grassland Administration and Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs.

The new list has three major differences compared with the list published in 1999.

Firstly, the protection level of 18 wild plants has been changed. Vatica guangxiensis and four other plants have been upgraded to first-class protected plants, while 13 first-class protected plants have been downgraded to second-class.

Secondly, 268 wild plants have been added to the new list, such as most types of Venus slippers and some wild plants in genera Tulipa, Cymbidium and Oryza.

Thirdly, 35 wild plants have been removed from the list due to their broad distribution, large population and stable conditions.

China is home to over 36,000 embryophyte, and nearly 50 percent of them are endemic species. The amended list aims to better save endangered wild plants and preserve biodiversity in China.

China has released the first batch of gamma photon data obtained by the Dark Matter Particle Explorer (DAMPE), Science and Technology Daily said on Wednesday.

The National Space Science Data Center (NSSDC) and the Purple Mountain Observatory (PMO) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences Tuesday released the scientific data collected by DAMPE, also known as Wukong or Monkey King.

According to the PMO, Wukong's satellite platform and payload have been working normally. It has finished the full-sky scan 11 times and collected about 10.7 billion cases of high-energy cosmic rays, obtaining the most accurate measurement results of cosmic-ray electrons, protons and helium nuclei above the trillion electron volts energy region.

The released data were recorded from January 1, 2016, to December 31, 2018, including 99,864 cases of gamma photon data and 1,096 records of related satellite status files. They can be accessed from the NSSDC and the PMO.

The NSSDC and the PMO said they will release more scientific data of gamma photons, carry out data analysis, and develop application technologies and tools.

Wukong was launched on December 17, 2015, to observe the energy spectra of high-energy electrons, including positrons, and gamma rays in space to find evidence of the existence of dark matter particles. It also has carried out research on the origin of cosmic-ray and gamma-ray astronomy.

Wukong's payload has four parts: a plastic scintillator array detector, a silicon array detector, a calorimeter, and a neutron detector. It has extremely high energy resolution in gamma-ray observation and is expected to better study dark matter."
2012,China cultivates new rice varieties to enhance food supply,"China is continuing its efforts in cultivating new rice varieties, reinforcing the country's food supply.

The second generation of super hybrid rice Chaoyouqianhao recorded a yield of 1,107.5 kg per mu (16.6 tonnes per hectare) in Caoba Town, Mengzi City, southwest China's Yunnan Province, on Sunday, achieving an average yield of over 1,000 kg per mu for the fourth consecutive year. The regular rice yield only ranges from 300 to 600 kg per mu.

The rice variety was developed by late agronomist Yuan Longping, China's hybrid rice pioneer, and his team. This is the fifth year Mengzi City has collaborated with an affiliate of the China National Hybrid Rice Research and Development Center to conduct high-production rice research.

At the end of August, 15 mu of Yuan's giant rice variety was used in a trial planting in Changhong Village in Shiwan Town, Dazu District, southwestern Chongqing Municipality. The rice thrived, indicating a successful experiment and its potential commercial use in a wider area.

The rice plants are about 2.2 meters tall, twice as tall as regular rice plants. The variety is resistant to heat, disease, flooding, salt-alkali soil and lodging – which occurs when crops are flattened to the ground, reducing the yield and making them difficult to harvest.

It was the variety's first time being widely planted in Chongqing, and it is well adapted to the city's hot weather. The rice will be harvested at the end of September with an estimated yield of at least 800 kg per mu.

""The giant rice will be also tested in different altitudes and different weather conditions as we will prepare for its mass planting and production,"" said Luo Zhiqiang, an agronomist in charge of the new variety planting at the Chongqing branch of the China National Hybrid Rice R&D Center.

As the giant rice variety is able to accommodate more water, the paddy field can also be used as a pond to breed fish, shrimp and crabs at the same time.

Thanks to the giant rice variety, Yuan's dreams are turning into a reality. He mentioned on several occasions that he wished someday he could ""enjoy the cool under the rice crops taller than men"" and that hybrid rice could be grown all over the world to help solve global food scarcity."
2013,World's largest plant capturing CO2 from air starts up in Iceland,"The plant, named Orca, will draw 4,000 tonnes of CO2 out of the air every year when operating at capacity, equivalent to the emissions from about 870 cars. /CFP

The plant, named Orca, will draw 4,000 tonnes of CO2 out of the air every year when operating at capacity, equivalent to the emissions from about 870 cars. /CFP

The world's largest plant designed to suck carbon dioxide (CO2) out of the air and turn it into rock started operation in Iceland on Wednesday, the companies behind the plant said.

The plant, named Orca, after the Icelandic word ""orka"" (energy), consists of four units, each made up of two metal boxes, similar in appearance to the containers used for maritime shipping.

Constructed by Switzerland's Climeworks and Iceland's Carbfix, when operating at capacity the plant will draw 4,000 tonnes of CO2 out of the air every year, according to the companies.

According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, that equates to emissions from about 870 cars.

To collect CO2, the plant uses fans to draw air into a collector, which has a filter inside.

Once the filter is filled with CO2, the collector is closed and the temperature is raised to release and collect the highly concentrated gas.

The CO2 is then mixed with water before being injected at a depth of 1,000 metres into the nearby basalt rock where it is petrified.

Proponents of so-called carbon capture and storage believe this technology can become a major tool in the fight against climate change.

Critics however argue that the technology is still prohibitively expensive and might take decades to operate at scale."
2014,World in a drop of water: DNA tool transforms nature tracking,"In their search for pink river dolphins, researchers in the Peruvian Amazon scooped up river water containing genetic material they hoped could be useful in tracing the elusive creature. They found what they were looking for, and more.

The environmental DNA collected yielded information on 675 species, including dozens of land-based mammals like deer, jaguar, giant anteaters and monkeys as well as 25 species of bat.

""It's kind of mind blowing,"" said Kat Bruce, founder of the eDNA firm NatureMetrics, which carried out the study for the wildlife charity WWF.

The technology is increasingly used to track rare species.

Bruce hopes eDNA will help revolutionize the way the world measures and monitors nature.

It is at the heart of a $15-million project with the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) that aims to collect and analyze 30,000 freshwater samples over three years from major river systems, including the Amazon, Ganges and Mekong Delta.

With species in precipitous decline and growing calls for international targets on biodiversity protection, organizers say this ""eBioAtlas"" can help inform policy and focus scarce conservation resources.

""What the eBioAtlas will do in the middle of this mass extinction is hopefully start to fill those gaps in in a way that is scalable,"" said Mike Morris, who heads the project for NatureMetrics, at an event showcasing the project at the IUCN conference in Marseille this week.

The IUCN plans to feed the information into conservation tools like its Red List of Threatened Species.

It offers a ""simple and, I would say, precise way to tell us where species are,"" said Paola Geremicca, who leads IUCN's corporate engagement."

2019,New lava flow spews from Spain's Canaries volcano,"A new flow of highly liquid lava emerged from the volcano erupting in Spain's Canary islands on Friday, authorities said, as a huge magma shelf continues to build on the Atlantic Ocean. The fresh outpouring of molten rock began around 2:30 a.m., Spain's IGME geological institute said, adding that it was coming from a new exit on the side of the Cumbre Vieja volcano on La Palma island.

Videos posted online by IGME and the Volcanic Institute of the Canaries (Involcan) showed a large stream of glowing lava moving across charred earth. The new flow in the archipelago off the northwest coast of Africa comes on top of magma forming a huge platform in the Atlantic Ocean, which has grown beyond 0.2 square kilometers. Cumbre Vieja began erupting on September 19 and has so far spewed out 80 million cubic metres of lava, Canaries regional president Angel Victor Torres told reporters. That volume was twice as much as neighboring volcano Teneguia unleashed in a 1971 eruption that lasted twice as long, Torres said.

So far no one has died or been hurt in the eruption, although around 6,000 of La Palma's 85,000 inhabitants have been evacuated. Some 870 buildings have been destroyed and 3.58 square kilometers of ground covered in lava, according to data from the EU's Copernicus satellite observation program. The lava flow reached the sea overnight from Tuesday to Wednesday, releasing large amounts of smoke and toxic gas. Authorities have set up a 3.5-kilometer exclusion zone that also extends for two nautical miles at sea and told nearby residents to remain indoors. On Friday, levels of harmful sulfur dioxide rose in Tazacorte, the nearest village to where the lava is plunging into the sea, while the whole area has seen an increase in ash particles. Minister Felix Bolanos visited the island to reassure locals, saying that the government would make reconstruction a ""priority."" Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez will make a third visit to La Palma on Sunday, he added.

The looming threat of extinction for Malaysia's charismatic animal species like the tiger and orangutan may grab the public's attention. But there's far less focus on the threat of extinction of plant and tree species that form the habitats those animals need to live and thrive. A recent study by Botanic Gardens Conservation International found that almost one-third of the world's tree species are on the brink of being wiped out. Malaysia, one of the most biodiverse countries on Earth, is among the countries with the most tree species are at risk. Malaysian NGO Tropical Rainforest Conservation and Research Centre (TRCRC) is striving to halt and reverse that trend.

About 15 species are critically endangered, and around 35 are endangered. ""Our mission is to basically safeguard our endangered species of trees in Malaysia, focusing on a single family of trees which dominate the canopy in intact forest, the dipterocarpaceae, said Dzaeman Dzulkifli, TRCRC executive director. The TRCRC aims to track down populations of endangered trees, gather their seeds, propagate them and eventually reintroduce them into the wild to rehabilitate sites, expand the diversity of secondary forests and create corridors to link up fragmented patches of jungle.

Many of the trees only bear fruit once every five to seven years, Shah Alam, Malaysia, September 23, 2021. /Rian Maelzer Many of the trees only bear fruit once every five to seven years, Shah Alam, Malaysia, September 23, 2021. /Rian Maelzer

It's a challenging and time-consuming task. ""We have some species that flower every year, but the majority of them fruit and flower every five to seven years,"" Dzaeman explained. Much of the loss of tree biodiversity in Malaysia has been caused by logging the dipterocarp species, which is valued for its timber, by converting land into timber and palm oil plantations and residential and commercial development. But climate change is likely also playing a role, disrupting the cycles of drought that trigger the trees' flowering and fruiting, Dzaeman said.

2026,Why climate change is making it harder to chase fall foliage in U.S.,"Droughts cause leaves to turn brown and wither before they can reach peak color. Heat waves prompt leaves to fall before autumn even arrives. Extreme weather events like hurricanes strip trees of their leaves altogether. For a cheery autumnal activity, leaf peeping in the U.S. is facing some serious threats from the era of climate change.

Leaf peeping, the practice of traveling to watch nature display its fall colors, is a beloved annual activity in many corners of the U.S., especially New England and New York. But recent seasons have been disrupted by weather conditions there and elsewhere, and the trend is likely to continue as the planet warms, said arborists, conservationists and ecologists.

Typically, by the end of September, leaves cascade into warmer hues throughout the U.S. but this year, many areas have yet to even pivot from their summer green shades. In northern Maine, where peak conditions typically arrive in late September, forest rangers had reported less than 70 percent color change and moderate leaf drop on Wednesday.

Across the country in Denver, high temperatures have left ""dead, dry edges of leaves"" early in the season, said Michael Sundberg, a certified arborist in the area. ""Instead of trees doing this gradual change, they get thrown these wacky weather events. They change all of a sudden, or they drop leaves early,"" Sundberg said. ""It's been a few years since we've had a really good leaf year where you just drive around town and see really good color."" The reason climate change can be bad for fall foliage has a bit to do with plant biology. When fall arrives, and day length and temperature drop, the chlorophyll in a leaf breaks down, and that causes it to lose its green color. The green gives way to the yellows, reds and oranges that make for dramatic autumn displays. Achieving those peak colors is a delicate balance, and one jeopardized by changes in the environment, said Paul Schaberg, a research plant physiologist with the U.S. Forest Service based in Burlington, Vermont. Warm fall temperatures can cause leaves to remain green longer and delay the onset of what leaf peepers look for in terms of fall color, he said.

Mountains in Oregon State, U.S. /VCG Mountains in Oregon State, U.S. /VCG

Worse, dry summers can stress trees and cause their leaves to miss the fall color turn altogether, Schaberg said. A 2003 study in the journal Tree Physiology that Schaberg co-wrote stated that ""environmental stress can accelerate"" leaf deterioration. ""If climate change is going to mean significant drought, that means trees are going to shut down, and many trees are just going to drop their leaves,"" he said. ""Severe droughts that really mean that the tree just can't function - that doesn't improve color."" It's happening already. This summer's heatwave in the Pacific Northwest brought temperatures of over 110 degrees Fahrenheit (43 Celsius) to Oregon, and that led to a condition called ""foliage scorch,"" in which leaves prematurely browned, said Chris Still, a professor at the Forest Ecosystems and Society department at Oregon State University.

The leaves' pigment was degraded and they fell shortly thereafter, Still said. That will lead to a less scenic fall season in parts of Oregon. ""That's a really big example of color change just due to heatwave shock,"" Still said. Climate change also poses longer-term threats that could disrupt leaf peeping. The spread of diseases and invasive pests and the northward creep of tree species are all factors tied to warming temperatures that could make for less vibrant fall colors, said Andrew Richardson, a professor of ecosystem science at Northern Arizona University. The onset of fall colors, which has been drifting later into the fall, could also continue to arrive later, said Jim Salge, foliage expert for Yankee magazine. ""My observations in the last decade have had more years that were later than what we would consider historical averages,"" he said. The economic impact of poor leaf peeping seasons could also be consequential. Officials throughout New England have said fall tourism brings billions of dollars into those states every year.

Professor Scott Power from Australia's University of Southern Queensland, one of the lead researchers, said studying climate fluctuations in the Tropical Pacific, referred to in the paper ""Tropical Pacific Decadal Variability"" (TPDV), was significant as temperature changes in the ocean can have far-reaching impacts.

""Internal TPDV modulates drought, wildfires, floods, polar sea-ice extent, river flow, agricultural production, and the rate at which the planet warms in response to greenhouse gas increases,"" said Power.

The research also outlined the impacts the ocean's warming could have on marine life, such as the potential to reduce coastal fish populations and cause fundamental damage to coral reefs on Australia's coast and throughout the Pacific islands.

He said the recorded fluctuations thus far have been alarming.

""Warming in the western Pacific has been so great that temperatures experienced over the past decade have been beyond the range evident in reliable instrumental records.""

Power hoped that the team's work would be able to shed more light on a phenomenon that, while a major subject of research, is still surrounded by a large amount of uncertainty.

""As TPDV affects risks from natural disasters, our ability to predict it has the potential to help communities, governments and industry plan for future climate impacts,"" Power said.

The research has predicted that recent record-breaking temperatures were just the beginning of the trend.

""Further greenhouse warming in the equatorial Pacific will ensure that record-setting high temperatures will be experienced for decades to come.""

2035,Saihanba forest farm wins UN pact's Land for Life China award,"The Saihanba mechanized forest farm, the world's largest artificial plantation, in north China's Hebei Province, has won the 2021 Land for Life Award in the national category at a ceremony held during the 8th Kubuqi International Desert Forum.

The Land for Life Award is designed by the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) for individuals, communities and programs making outstanding contributions to the recovery and restoration of degraded landscapes worldwide.

In 2017, the Saihanba afforestation community won the UN Champions of the Earth Award for its outstanding contribution to transforming degraded land into a lush green paradise.

Saihanba was once a royal hunting ground of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911), but by the late 1950s, it had degraded into an area of barren wilderness. And the forestry ministry then decided to build an artificial forest farm to block the southward movement of sandland in 1962.

Thanks to consistent efforts by three generations of Saihanba foresters over the past 59 years, the deteriorating trend of local ecology has been reversed.

Now, with a total forest landscape of about 76,700 hectares, Saihanba has become a national forest park and nature reserve as well as an important ecological shield for Beijing and adjacent regions.

2040,The Great Herbs: Miracle herbal 'sweet potato',"""The Legend of He Shouwu"" written by Li Ao in the Tang Dynasty tells a story about a sickly man who magically became strong after eating a plant's root tuber. Once upon a time, there was a man in the village whose name was He Shouwu. He was born weak and sick. One day, he went to the mountains to collect herbs. Suddenly he saw the vines of a plant intersecting. When he untied the vines, they would tie themselves again, which surprised him. He dug up the root tuber of the plant and took it back to the village.

When all the villagers were wondering what kind of plant it was, an old man from the mountain said to He Shouwu, ""The vines intertwine, which must be a sign. It could be a gift from the gods, why not give it a try?"" After hearing this, He felt that it made sense, so he ground the root into powder and took it. As the story has it, he recovered from his illness, his white hair turned black and he became stronger after a year of taking the powder. Knowing this story, the writer named the root tuber after He Shouwu and wrote it down for posterity. The mythical Chinese herb, which looks like a sweet potato, is called fleeceflower root (Heshouwu in Chinese).

As Li Shizhen wrote in ""Compendium of Materia Medica,"" (Ben Cao Gang Mu), Heshouwu mainly treats pain in the waist and knee, itching, difficulty in walking, excessive sweating, scrofular tuberculoderm and sore boils. According to the ""Chinese Pharmacy Dictionary,"" it's clinically used to treat malaria, whooping cough, furuncle and lower serum cholesterol.

The root tuber of Polygonum multiforum Thunb has a bitter, sweet and astringent taste and a mild warm nature. It is mainly used as medicine. This perennial herbal plant of the Polygonaceae family is widely disturbed in China. It is now mainly cultivated and produced in Henan, Hubei, Guizhou, Sichuan, Jiangsu, and Guangxi. It grows in shrubs in valleys, hillside forests, ditches and crevices at altitudes of 200 to 3,000 meters."

2042,Bird lover's journal: Discovery of bee-eater couple raises questions,"When Fang Qiaoran, a bird lover in south China's Shenzhen City, spotted two blue-throated bee-eaters at a park in her city, she felt something was odd.

First, the bee-eaters, usually found in the subtropical and tropical mangrove forest in southeast Asia, are rarely seen in Shenzhen. Second and what's more important, the couple was not afraid of her, allowing her to photograph from only 5 meters away, which is an impossible distance for almost any wild bird. One even flew on her backpack.

""Wild birds are very timid, but these two are not. At the same time, they are very apt at preying, which sets them apart from the domestically kept ones. So it got us wondering. Besides, it's the migration season now and two typhoons affected Shenzhen lately; these two could be stragglers. It's impossible to guess where they come from,"" Fang, the experienced bird watcher said.

Her doubts were echoes by bird experts in Shenzhen Birdwatching Association.

""Based on the information we have, I think the chances of the bee-eater couple being wild are very slim, because they are too close to people and they stay for too long. The couple have been here for several days, while usually they would just stay for no more than one day before departing again to migrate further,"" said Zhang Gaofeng, deputy chairman of the association.

A local newspaper reported that the two bee-eaters were first discovered by a resident near Huanggang Park on September 22, and later mating behaviors were recorded between the two, confirming that they are a couple.

The newspaper said that the discovery is the second time that blue-throated bee-eaters have been spotted in Shenzhen. A male found in 2020 has been confirmed to be a released bird from domestic keeping.

2043,Alien Fungi: Bleeding mushroom,"Do you know that mushrooms can ""bleed""? The bleeding tooth fungus (Hydnellum peckii) can amazingly ooze out red fluid as if it had been pricked with a needle, but this is actually caused by a process similar to water seeping out at the edges of a plant's leaves. When the soil surrounding the fungus is too wet, the bleeding tooth fungus will have excess water inside, which creates pressure to force the water to ""bleed out."" Although scientists don't know what this gooey fluid is, they infer that its red color comes from a pigment found in the fungus.

Bleeding tooth fungi in Alaska, U.S. /Getty Bleeding tooth fungi in Alaska, U.S. /Getty

Interestingly, this ""bleeding"" phenomenon only happens when the bleeding tooth fungus is still young and growing. When it matures, it loses the red sap on the top and becomes rather dull in appearance. So, every ""bleeding"" mushroom you find is an adolescent. People even call it ""strawberries and cream,"" but you surely don't want to have a bowl of it. By the way, it is not toxic despite its sinister look.

Bleeding tooth fungus. /Getty Bleeding tooth fungus. /Getty

You might wonder why it is called ""tooth"" fungus because it doesn't always look like a molar. Well, it gets the name for the tooth-like spines beneath the ""bleeding"" cap, where its spores are produced. If you want to find the bleeding tooth fungus in the forest, you'd better look for coniferous trees first. The fungus develops a symbiotic relationship with coniferous trees. In other words, the tree provides carbon dioxide to the fungus, while the fungus helps the tree better absorb amino acids and minerals in the soil. Its presence often indicates that the forest is rich in biodiversity.

The bleeding tooth fungus surprisingly has many potential uses. People often dry it and make it into a beige dye. It can also create blue-green hues when combined with substances like alum or iron. Besides, scientists have discovered that the fungus contains anti-coagulant substances that can keep blood clots from forming and thelophoric acid, which may be used in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease in the future.

Unlike most fungi that sprout directly from the earth, the octopus stinkhorn emerges from an egg, usually around decaying wood chips or old stumps. When it turns mature, its arms will grow out of the egg on a short white stalk.

2049,Microbial diversity crucial for ecology in arid regions: study,"The relative importance of plant and soil microbial diversity for ecosystem multifunctionality varies along environmental gradients. The researchers from the School of Life Sciences, Lanzhou University in northwest China's Gansu Province, have studied multiple soil function traits across 130 dryland sites along a 4,000 km aridity gradient in northern China since 2013. They had collected more than 20,000 samples and data.

Chinese researchers have found that microbial diversity is crucial for ecological balance and stability in arid and extreme arid regions, according to a recent research article published in the journal Nature Communications.

The results showed a strong positive association between richness of plant species and soil multifunctionality in less arid regions, whereas microbial diversity, in particular of fungi, is positively associated with multifunctionality in arid and extreme arid regions.

The shifts of biodiversity-soil multifunctionality relationships at different aridity levels require more specific biodiversity conservation strategies to mitigate the effects of aridification, according to the article.

For example, the establishment of straw checkerboard barriers is one of the most effective strategies under more arid conditions, which can reduce the surface wind speed, accumulate precipitation, increase soil surface organic matter and nutrient contents, improve the soil micro-environment, accelerate the succession of soil microbial community and thus promote the development of biological soil crusts.

At a ministerial meeting of the Security Council, the officials urged the U.N.'s most powerful body to do more to address the security implications of climate change and make global warming a key part of all U.N. peacekeeping operations.

Using apocalyptic images, three presidents and seven foreign ministers warned Thursday that a warmer world is also a more violent one.

Irish President Micheal Martin who chaired the meeting, said climate change ""is already contributing to conflict in many parts of the world."" And Vietnamese President Nguyen Xuan Phuc said climate change ""is a war without gunfire so to speak that causes economic damage and losses in lives no less dire than actual wars.""

""The effects of climate change are particularly profound when they overlap with fragility and past or current conflicts,"" said U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres."" And when natural resources like water become scarce because of climate change, ""grievances and tensions can explode, complicating efforts to prevent conflict and sustain peace.""

""Our lives and daily realities are at the nexus of climate change insecurity,"" said Ilwad Elman, a Somali-Canadian peace activist. ""The impact of climate change and environmental degradation are also changing what it takes to build peace ... because we are experiencing climate-related shocks and stresses.""

The Security Council first discussed the impact of climate on peace and security in 2007 and has held a number of meetings about it since, most recently in February. But it remains off the council's agenda because of divisions among members. That means there can be no legally binding resolutions or official requests for action.

Ireland's Martin said he recognized the different views bit if the council is to meet its responsibility to maintain international peace and security, ""it must have the information and tools to analyze and address climate-related security risks.""

For years, academics who study conflict and climate change have been highlighting how events like a once-in-a-millennium Syrian drought have exacerbated conflicts without being the sole causes. It's a more nuanced approach to understanding conflict - and to developing tools that reduce its impact on societies.

""Look at almost every place where you see threats to international peace and security today, and you'll find that climate change is making things less peaceful, less secure, and rendering our response even more challenging,"" U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said. He cited a list of nations including Syria, Mali, Yemen, South Sudan and Ethiopia.

""We have to stop debating whether the climate crisis belongs in the Security Council,"" Blinken said, ""and instead ask how the council can leverage its unique powers to tackle the negative impacts of climate on peace and security.""

Both Russia and China, which is the world's top emitter of climate-damaging pollution, stressed their countries' commitment to cut emissions. So did Blinken for the United States, the second largest carbon polluter, and India, the third-largest, which also said climate change doesn't belong on the council agenda. Reenat Sandhu, a deputy Indian foreign secretary, said singling out one cause of conflict is ""counterproductive.""

""Climate change may enhance conflict, but cannot be determined as a reason for it,"" she said. ""Oversimplification of causes of conflict will not help in resolving them nor can it justify extreme policy measures. We need to bring back our focus to where it should be - combating climate change.”

Still, most of the leaders who spoke Thursday morning painted a gloomy picture for the planet as a whole. They said climate change needs to be fought in the same way the world is battling the coronavirus because, for the planet, it is a matter of life and death.

Decisions at the November U.N. climate conference in Glasgow, Scotland ""will decide whether this decade will be remembered as the decade when we started to save the planet or the beginning of the end,"" said Estonian President Kersti Jaljulaid.

At the General Assembly's annual gathering of world leaders on Thursday, Angolan President Joao Lourenco said Earth ""has been giving us increasingly clear signals that she is not happy with how we treat her, and is defending herself in the most violent manner possible.""

And the previous evening, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who will host the climate negotiations in Scotland, gave a speech that started with a lesson on extinction among mammals - and then reminded the world that humans, too, are mammals.

""Our grandchildren will know that we are the culprits. And they'll know that we knew - that we were warned,"" Johnson said. ""And they will ask themselves what kind of people we were to be so selfish and so shortsighted.""

One day, Hua heard a woman crying outside the window where the peonies were growing. However, he didn't see anyone but the peonies. The same thing happened several times and it puzzled him, so he told his wife about it. His wife said, ""Countless plants have become a good medicine, but the peony has been neglected. It's possible that you may not find out its value, so it feels aggrieved."" She added, ""you checked out the above-ground part of it, but you missed its underground part."" But Hua was still not convinced.

One day his wife lost a lot of blood during her period and had great pain in her abdomen, so she dug up the peony root and tried to turn it into a medicine for herself. Surprisingly, she recovered. When Hua realized what happened, he thanked his wife, ""Without you, I would have buried a good medicine."" Behind the beauty of peony, it has great medicinal value.

White peony root (L) and Red peony root (R). White peony root (L) and Red peony root (R).

The Chinese herbal peony is divided into white peony root and red peony root. White peony root, known as ""Bai Shao"" in Chinese, is the dry root of Chinese peony (Paeonia lactiflora Pall.), and red peony root, known as ""Chi Shao"" in Chinese, is the dry root of Veitch's peony (Paeonia veitchii Lynch). Although they both come from the peony genus, their properties are quite different.

In Li Shizhen's book ""Compendium of Materia Medica,"" (Ben Cao Gang Mu), he didn't subdivide white peony root and red peony root for discussion. According to the book, peony mainly cures abdominal pain, bone pain, beriberi, nosebleeds, hemoptysis, leucorrhea and tongue swelling. According to the ""Chinese Pharmacy Dictionary,"" white peony root is the primary treatment for nourishing blood, soothing the liver and relieving pain. It cures chest, abdomen and rib pain, diarrhea, abdominal pain, spontaneous sweating, night sweating and heavy menstrual bleeding. While red peony root can clear heat, promote blood circulation and remove blood stasis. It cures hematemesis, epistaxis, hemafecia, eye swelling and pain, carbuncle swelling and sore."

Obviously, the ardent bird lover could not let this year's autumn migration season pass without venturing out and pressing the shutter. This time, together with three teammates, she planned a five-day trip, September 14-18, in Shanghai and east China's Jiangsu Province, where the beaches offer an important stopover on birds' southward journey. But the journey was postponed and reduced by one day by Typhoon Chanthu, leaving them four days on their main business.

""I guess I'm not bad. I don't see myself as very diligent,"" she told CGTN. ""The majority of skilled birdwatchers in the country have a personal record of over 500 bird species. If you are over 900, that means you've been to most places in the country. But it takes more than that to reach 1,000, considering the fact that only no more than 800 bird species are pretty easy to spot in the country. People with a record over 1,000 often travel around just to see a single bird species."" The retiree took up birdwatching as a hobby to kill time after retirement in 2018, which is not uncommon among birdwatchers. When asked whether she feels tired of the frequent trips, she said she has only found herself wanting to go out more and more. Staying at home has become a dread to her. ""Every day is different! The birds can come and go at any moment during the migration season. You can never predict what birds you'll see that you like today. The only thing you can do is to pray that the birds stay longer. Or, you could stay put and wait, no matter how long that's going to take. Otherwise, you could only hope that you are lucky enough. But that's the beauty of it!"" More photos from this trip:

2069,Endangered monkeys thrive amid harmony with human guardians in S China,"A team of forest rangers has dedicated years to protecting white-headed langurs, with their conservation efforts helping to ensure a thriving population of the critically endangered species in a nature reserve in south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.



About 90 percent of white-headed langurs live in four regions of the Guangxi Chongzuo National Nature Reserve. Each family occupies a cluster of hills, with tree leaves being their primary source of food.

The animal was listed as critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and it is classified as a first-class state protected animal in China.



In 1982, Chongzuo's local wildlife sector established a protection station to conduct routine observation of the rare primates in the mountainous areas. Back then, 19-year-old Tang Lifeng became one of the first pioneering members of the patrol team.

""When we were patrolling and couldn't see any of the monkeys sometimes, we would imitate their sounds and they would then respond immediately, so that we could find them and see how many of them there were,"" said Tang.



About a decade later, China launched six national-level forestry projects of natural forest and wildlife protection, which paved the way for the rebound of a number of white-headed langur groups. While helping set up a comfortable habitat for the monkeys to thrive, Tang also explored ways to gain trust from the intelligent creatures.



""We take it slow when building up connections with them. They won't run away and are very friendly to us. They know well that we won't hurt them so they never run from us,"" Tang said.



The ranger team at the nature reserve has expanded in recent years, with up to 50 members now. Following long-term monitoring of white-headed langurs in the reserve, the rangers have mapped out the distribution areas of the over 130 subgroups of the monkey and documented separate files for them.



The reserve has been exploring feasible ways to solve habitat fragmentation caused by existing farmlands and roads spreading beneath the hills. Habitat fragmentation is likely to intensify inbreeding, lowering the genetic diversity of the species, the head of the reserve said.



The reserve, therefore, built two ""corridors,"" which were constructed with reinforced concrete and rails to prevent monkeys from being hit by vehicles, while using plants favored by the monkeys to guide their migration.



""We hope to create a better and better living environment for the white-headed langurs. With generations of efforts, we hope to keep increasing the population of the monkey and let our offspring still be able to see the white-headed langurs,"" said Meng Yuning, another staff member of the nature reserve.



The population of white-headed langurs in Chongzuo has surged from around 300 in the 1980s to more than 1,300, according to the latest data from the National Forestry and Grassland Administration.

2076,"Toxic gas, new rivers of molten lava endanger Spanish island","As a new volcanic vent blew open and unstoppable rivers of molten rock flowed toward the sea, authorities on a Spanish island warned Tuesday that more dangers lie ahead for residents, including earthquakes, lava flows, toxic gases, volcanic ash and acid rain. Several small earthquakes shook the island of La Palma in the Atlantic Ocean off northwest Africa on Tuesday, keeping nerves on edge after a volcanic eruption on Sunday. The island, with a population of 85,000, is part of the Canary Islands archipelago, a key tourist destination for Europeans.

Authorities said the new fissure demonstrated that the area was unstable and unsafe and kept people at least 2 kilometers away. The rivers of lava, up to six meters high, rolled down hillsides, burning and crushing everything in their path as they gradually closed in on the island's more densely populated coast. One was bearing down on Todoque, where more than 1,000 people live and where emergency services were preparing evacuations. So far, the eruption has destroyed around 190 houses and forced the evacuation of 6,000 people. ""The truth is that it's a tragedy to see people losing their properties,"" said municipal worker Fernando Díaz in the town of El Paso.

The lava's advance has slowed to about 120 meters an hour, according to the head of the Canary Island Volcanic Emergency Plan, Miguel Ángel Morcuende, and wasn't expected to reach the Atlantic Ocean before Wednesday. Canary Islands government chief Ángel Víctor Torres said ""when (the lava) reaches the sea, it will be a critical moment."" The meeting of the lava, whose temperature exceeds 1,000 degrees Celsius, with a body of water could cause explosions and produce clouds of toxic gas. Torres asked locals to remember the island's last eruption in 1971, when one person died after inhaling the gas emitted as lava met the water. A change in the wind direction blew the ashes from the volcano across a vast area on the western side of the island, with the black particles blanketing everything. Volcanic ash is an irritant for the eyes and lungs. The volcano has also been spewing out between 8,000 and 10,500 tonnes of sulfur dioxide – which also affects the lungs – every day, the Volcanology Institute said. Adding to the dangers, the emergence of new cracks in the earth spewing lava cannot be ruled out, said Nemesio Pérez, head of the Canary Islands Volcanology Institute, who noted there is ""important superficial seismic activity in the area.""

The new fissure that appeared Monday night is 900 meters north of the Cumbre Vieja ridge, where the volcano first erupted Sunday after a week of thousands of small earthquakes. That earthquake swarm warned authorities that an eruption was likely and allowed many people to be evacuated, avoiding casualties. The new fissure opened after what the Canary Islands Volcanology Institute said was a magnitude-3.8 quake. Scientists say the lava flows could last for weeks or months. Torres described the lava-hit region as a ""catastrophe zone"" and said he would request money to rebuild roads, water pipes and create temporary accommodations for families who have lost their homes and farmland. Spain's King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia are to visit the area on Thursday.

Talking about rhinos, many people think of their horns. Their name ""rhinoceros"" even comes from Ancient Greek words, meaning ""nose horn."" Sadly, their iconic horns bring harm to them by making them the target of poachers. Rhino horns are either made into luxurious decorations or used in traditional medicine, even though they are made of the same substance found in our fingernails.

It's estimated that there are now less than 29,000 rhinos left in the wild, compared to 500,000 at the beginning of the 20th century, according to Save the Rhino International. The population of Sumatran rhino and Javan rhino are even both below 80.

FILE PIC: The Horn of Africa region could experience widespread hunger and malnutrition in the last quarter of this year amid a prolonged dry spell, the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) said on Tuesday. /AFP

The Horn of Africa region could experience widespread hunger and malnutrition in the last quarter of this year amid a prolonged dry spell, the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) said on Tuesday.

According to IGAD's latest analysis on the escalating food insecurity in the region, about 36.7 to 37.2 million people will likely grapple with acute hunger in the near future due to shocks linked to conflicts, extreme weather events, and the COVID-19 pandemic.

Workneh Geneyehu, executive secretary of IGAD said the Horn of Africa region comprises 20 percent of the highly food insecure global population, hence the need for urgent interventions to avert a humanitarian crisis.

""There is a need for us to initiate a paradigm shift to a longer-term view that inspires us to come up with coherent, coordinated, and cost-effective development investments that target the root causes of food crises in our region,"" Geneyehu said in a statement issued in Nairobi.

He noted that the latest weather forecast in the region points to a drier than usual October to December season, leading to crop failure, water stress and competition for pasture among herders.

Three countries in the Horn of Africa region including Sudan, Ethiopia and South Sudan are currently among the ten worst global food insecurity hotspots, according to IGAD analysis.

In addition, nearly 79 percent of IGAD region's population facing severe hunger crisis is from the three countries, with Sudan, Ethiopia and South Sudan accounting for 9.6 million, 8.6 million and 6.5 million respectively.

David Phiri, Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) sub regional coordinator for Eastern Africa said that governments should invest in climate-resilient farming systems, extension services, peacebuilding and early warning to limit the impact of recurrent droughts on livelihoods.

""Market access, anticipatory and emergency humanitarian response to crises must remain at the core of our collective response to build and protect farmer's resilience to shocks,"" said Phiri.

Michael Dunford, World Food Program Regional Director for Eastern Africa said there was an urgency to extend support to vulnerable communities affected by food and water scarcity."

2087,Bees kill dozens of endangered penguins in South Africa,"A swarm of bees has killed 63 endangered African penguins on a beach outside Cape Town, the Southern African Foundation for the Conservation of Coastal Birds said on Sunday.

African penguins, which inhabit the coast and islands of southern Africa, are on the International Union for Conservation of Nature's red list, meaning they face a high risk of extinction.

The death of these penguins is a very rare occurrence. ""After tests, we found bee stings around the penguins' eyes,"" said the foundation's David Roberts, a clinical veterinarian. And dead bees were also found on the scene.

The protected birds, found on Friday, were from a colony at Simonstown, a small town near Cape Town. The area is a national park, and the Cape honey bees are part of the ecosystem. ""The penguins ... must not die just like that as they are already in danger of extinction. They are a protected species,"" said Roberts.

The South African National Parks said the birds were taken to the foundation for post-mortems and samples sent for disease and toxicology testing. ""There were no external physical injuries found on any of the birds,"" a park statement said. The post-mortems showed all the penguins had multiple bee stings.

2088,The Great Herbs: Female ginseng,"Legend has it that in ancient times there was a young man named Wang Fu who lived with his mother and made a living by farming and collecting medicine. Hundreds of kilometers away from home, there was a huge mountain, said to grow many magical herbs, but few people dared to go there because of the rough roads, poisonous snakes and wild animals. Fu wanted to go up the mountain to find the magic medicine, but his mother advised him to go after marriage. Fu followed his mother's wishes. One day after his marriage, his neighbors talked about him behind his back, saying that he was too timid to go to the mountain. When the word reached Fu's ears, he made up his mind to explore the mountain. Fu said to his wife, ""If I don't return after three years, you can marry another man."" The next day, he went up the mountain.

Three years passed, and Fu hadn't come home. The mother thought he must be dead and advised her daughter-in-law to remarry another man at her son's request. However, less than half a month after the remarriage, he came back with a full load of rare medicinal herbs. After hearing about his wife's remarriage, he was deeply distressed and regretful and gave all the herbs to his wife. From then on, the wife was so sad that she became sick with melancholy and had irregular periods. She was so distressed that she tried to eat the herbs all in an attempt to poison herself to death. Unexpectedly, instead of dying, her periods became regular. The herb Wang Fu picked is called Dong quai (also known as Female ginseng).

In ancient times, Dong quai has the meaning of ""thinking of husband"" since its Chinese name ""Danggui"" is short for ""Ying Dang Gui Lai"" (""should return""), according to ""Compendium of Materia Medica.""

As Li Shizhen wrote in ""Compendium of Materia Medica,"" (Ben Cao Gang Mu) , Dong quai mainly cures headaches, heart and abdominal pain, ulcers, and it has the effect of discharging pus and relieving pain, and replenishing blood. According to the ""Chinese Pharmacy Dictionary,"" it's clinically used in the treatment of diseases such as muscle, joint pain and neuralgia, chronic tracheitis, chronic pelvic inflammatory, menopathy and hypertension."
2089,Volcano erupts on Spanish island of La Palma,"A volcano erupted on the Spanish Canary Island of La Palma on Sunday, the islands' government said.

Just before the eruption, authorities had evacuated about 40 people with mobility problems and farm animals from the villages around the volcano.

Soldiers were deployed to help with the evacuation, the defense ministry said, and it is expected that more residents will be evacuated from surrounding towns.

Ahead of the eruption, scientists had recorded a series of earthquakes reaching 3.8 magnitude in the national park, according to the Spanish National Geographical Institute (ING).

The earliest recorded volcanic eruption in La Palma took place in 1430, according to the ING.

In the last eruption in 1971, one man was killed when he took photographs near the lava flows but no property was damaged."
2090,Better environment benefits both wildlife and humans in Sichuan,"The growth of the wild giant panda population in Ya'an, southwest China's Sichuan Province indicates their living conditions have been improved and China's efforts to protect their habitats have paid off.



There are more than 50 giant pandas in the Ya'an Bifeng Canyon Panda Base and 1,864 wild pandas, and the numbers continue to grow, according to Huang Zhi, deputy head of Administrative Office, China Conservation and Research Center for Giant Panda.

The population growth is attributed to the efforts to protect giant pandas' habitats.

Since 2019, nine coal mines were closed in Ya'an, phasing out 1.11 million tonnes of coal production capacity. With the improvements in the local ecology, the population of wild giant pandas is also on the rise.

The improved ecology has not only provided local villagers with a better living environment, but also created opportunities to earn more money.

In Ya'an's Zhougongshan Township, towering green stalks form a vast stretch of bamboo sea with an area of nearly 3,300 hectares, purifying the air, conserving the water and soil, and serving as an industry for local villagers to make extra money without leaving home to look for jobs."

Sichuan pepper is a popular spice over the country. It is indigenous to Sichuan Province but is also planted in Shaanxi. It is used in authentic Sichuan cuisine in almost every dish from hotpot and soups, to stir-fries and dipping sauces.

Recently, farmers of the village have been busy harvesting the pepper.

""This year, the peppers have good quality. I have hired more than 10 people to harvest the peppers. This year's income is estimated to be 120,000 yuan (about $18,650),"" said Xue Haiwang, a Sichuan pepper farmer.

The village has organized locals to grow the spice because the area happens to have favorable soil and climate conditions for the peppers. In addition, the plant can yield a handsome return at a low cost, according to a local official.

At present, the village has planted over 60 hectares of peppers, which is expected to yield 12,000 kilograms this year."
2096,An Amur tiger undergoes an X-ray on his spine,"Staff at Yorkshire Wildlife Park were relieved when a 12-year-old tiger Vladimir woke up from a risky medical procedure. The big cat has a curve in its spine that causes him discomfort, so to check the problem, he has to be under anaesthetic.

As the procedure could cause the tiger to hallucinate or even stop breathing, the team leader described the process as a ""heart-in-the-throat situation"". The tiger is recovering well from the anaesthetic, and has to undergo a check once a year to make sure his condition has not progressed.

The Amur tiger is one of the word's most endangered animals, and is mainly distributed in the forests of eastern Russia and northeast China. A pilot Northeast China Tiger and Leopard National Park has been built to help bring back the precious feline.

2097,African environment ministers renew support for green recovery,"Environment ministers from the African continent on Thursday pledged mobilization of additional resources to accelerate a post-pandemic recovery that is green and inclusive.

Speaking at the 18th session of the African Ministerial Conference on Environment (AMCEN) that took place virtually, the ministers said that supportive policies, adequate financing and political goodwill is key to place the continent on a green and sustainable recovery pathway.

Barbara Creecy, South African Minister of Environment, Forestry and Fisheries and outgoing president of AMCEN, said that enhanced protection of habitats and climate financing will revitalize Africa's quest for green pandemic recovery.

""We can use environmental sustainability as a vehicle for post COVID-19 recovery in Africa. The continent should adopt green stimulus packages to support its journey towards low carbon growth pathways,"" said Creecy.

The meeting of African environment ministers held under the theme of ""Securing people's well-being and ensuring environmental sustainability in Africa"", was also attended by representatives of multilateral organizations and continental blocs.

Inger Andersen, executive director of UN Environment Program (UNEP) that has served as the secretariat of AMCEN since its inception in 1985, stressed that Africa's ability to overcome pandemic shocks hinges on green investments.

According to Andersen, the continent should enact progressive legislation and policies, promote investments in clean technologies and harness nature-based solutions to accelerate recovery from pandemic-linked economic downturn.

She said that Africa has a chance to rebuild its economies, strengthen climate resilience of communities if governments explore innovative financing toward renewable energy, pollution control and ecosystems restoration.

Abdou Karim Sall, Minister for Environment and Sustainable Development of Senegal and incoming president of AMCEN underscored the critical role of regional cooperation, sharing of best practices and policy harmonization to promote green recovery and restore degraded ecosystems in Africa.

Josefa Leonel Corriea Sacko, commissioner for Agriculture, Rural Development, Blue Economy and Sustainable Environment at the African Union Commission, said that investments in green recovery will unleash multiple benefits including food security, improved health outcomes and greater access to clean energy.

According to Sacko, a green recovery master plan for the continent once implemented fully will boost war against poverty, create new jobs, reduce negative impact of climatic shocks to livelihoods, improve peace and stability.

She said continental blocs have rallied behind green financing to help restore livelihoods devastated by the pandemic and promote climate-resilient development.

2098,Step up climate action by learning from ozone layer protection,"UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Thursday asked the world to step up climate action by learning from the success story of protecting the ozone layer.

""The Montreal Protocol began life as a mechanism to protect and heal the ozone layer. It has done its job well over the past three decades,"" writes António Guterres in his 2021 message on the UN website. He said that the cooperation we have seen under the Montreal Protocol is exactly what is needed now to take on climate change, an equally existential threat to our societies.

The Montreal Protocol is more than just an example of how multilateralism can and should work, it is an active tool to help meet the global vision for sustainable development, he said in a message for the International Day for the Preservation of the Ozone Layer, which falls on September 16.

Under the Kigali Amendment to the protocol, nations have committed to phasing down hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), powerful greenhouse gases used as coolants. When fully implemented, the Kigali Amendment could prevent 0.4 degrees Celsius of global warming this century, he said.

Furthermore, the Kigali Amendment can also help increase food security. By reducing HFCs, increasing energy efficiency and creating more ozone- and climate-friendly technologies, the Kigali Amendment can bring sustainable access to vital cooling services to millions of people. Such services would reduce food loss in developing countries, where food often spoils before it can reach markets. Getting produce from farmers to consumers would help reduce hunger, poverty and the environmental impact of the agricultural sector, he said.

Another important benefit of expanding cooling is the storage of medicines and vaccines, such as COVID-19 vaccines, he added.

""The Montreal Protocol and the Kigali Amendment show us that by acting together, anything is possible. So let us act now to slow climate change, feed the world's hungry and protect the planet that we all depend on,"" said Guterres.

The world in 2021 was missing the mark of building back sustainably from the COVID-19 crisis and ""not going in the right direction,"" Taalas said.

""There was some thinking that the COVID-19 lockdowns would have had a positive impact on the… atmosphere, which is not the case,"" WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas said at a news briefing.

The virus-related economic downturn caused only a temporary reduction in CO2 emissions and it was not enough to reverse rising levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, according to UN agency the World Meteorological Organization (WMO).

The pace of climate change has not been slowed by the global COVID-19 pandemic and the world remains behind in its battle to cut carbon emissions, the United Nations said on Thursday.

Reduction targets for emissions are not being met and there is a rising likelihood the world will miss its Paris Agreement aim of reducing global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, the WMO said in its United in Science 2021 report.

""This is a critical year for climate action,"" U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in a statement, and the results were an ""alarming appraisal of just how far off course we are.""

""This year has seen fossil fuel emissions bounce back, greenhouse gas concentrations continuing to rise and severe human-enhanced weather events that have affected health, lives and livelihoods on every continent,"" he said.

'Immediate reductions needed'

Concentrations in the atmosphere of the major greenhouse gases - CO2, methane and nitrous oxide - continued to increase in 2020 and the first half of 2021, the UN said.

The average global temperature for the past five years was among the highest on record, estimated at 1.06 degrees Celsius to 1.26 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.

There is now a 40 percent chance that the average global temperature in one of the next five years will be at least 1.5 degrees Celsius warmer than pre-industrial levels, the report said.

""Unless there are immediate, rapid and large-scale reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius will be impossible, with catastrophic consequences for people and the planet on which we depend,"" Guterres said.

The report comes a week after a study by University College London experts, published in Nature, warned that the vast majority of the world's fossil fuel reserves would have to be left in the ground to maintain even a 50/50 chance of hitting the Paris target."

The medium-sized, pale-colored owl has long wings and a short, squarish tail. Females are slightly larger in size than males.

It's also called a monkey-faced owl because of its big round face.

The nocturnal bird can see in daylight, but their pupils don't contract like human eyes, so to block out the extra light, they often close their eyes halfway or more. They might look sleepy or even half asleep, when in fact they are wide awake and alert.

2102,China's National Games aim to achieve carbon neutrality,"China's 14th National Games, which opened on Wednesday night, are expected to achieve the goal of carbon neutrality throughout the 13-day schedule of events, its organizers said.

For the first time in National Games history, China has proposed the goal of carbon neutrality in sports as it advocates green development.

An estimated 200,000 tonnes of carbon emissions will be produced during this year's National Games, scheduled for September 15-27, which will be neutralized through emission reduction, carbon sink and the purchase of Chinese Certified Emission Reductions.

A total of 8,198 industrial sources, 5,207 dust sources, 43,600 mobile sources and 45,000 food and catering sources will be included in the list for air quality control during the Games.

China aims to reach a carbon peak by 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality nationwide by 2060.

""Carbon neutrality"" means using afforestation, energy conservation and emission reduction to offset greenhouse gas emissions, realizing a relative ""zero emission."""

The creature is called lancelet, an invertebrate with a notochord instead of a backbone. In China, it could be found in the sea near Hong Kong, Shandong Province and Xiamen City of southeast China's Fujian Province. As it carries the characteristics of both vertebrates and invertebrates, it serves as a model organism for studying evolution.

Lancelet used to be widely distributed in East China Sea. Due to excessive fishing and habitat loss, large amount of lancelets died in the past decades. To protect the species, Xiamen City established ecological reserves to protect the animal. It is also listed as second-class state protected animal in China.

2106,Heartbreaking video: Mother dolphin refuses to let dead calf go,"A grieving mother dolphin just would not let go of its dead baby.

A heartbreaking video taken on September 3 near Zhanjiang City of south China's Guangdong Province shows a Chinese white dolphin using its beak to keep her lifeless calf's body above water while she swims. When the carcass sinks underwater, she dives down to rescue it without hesitation.

Li Min, a dolphin expert with South China Sea Fisheries Research Institute who took the video, said the mourning mother could carry the carcass for days.

Li said the cause of the calf's death remains unknown without an autopsy.

""The cause could be congenital health problems, an inexperienced mother or environment pollution, such as noise or water pollution. It could also be a result of infanticide, which means that it was killed by a male because of intraspecific bullying,"" the dolphin expert said.

Dolphins are highly intelligent mammals that share many emotional similarities with human beings. Mother dolphins and their babies share a strong maternal bond, and the calves usually stay several years close to their mother until going on their own.

Chinese white dolphin, or Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin, is rated as ""vulnerable"" on the list of threatened species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). It's under first-class state protection in China.

2108,"Why do Xinjiang herdsmen transfer 300,000 livestock in autumn?","When the seasons change, herdsmen in Xinjiang's Altay Prefecture start to fulfill their promise to nature, relocating their herds to autumn pastures. The view of more than 300,000 livestock transferring with their keepers is as stunning as Africa's Great Migration.

As most of the nomads live in mountainous areas, their seasonal move is mainly driven by the vertical distribution of climate. They use different routes, ranging from dozens to hundreds of kilometers. During the spring, they stay in the warm dry grasslands where sunlight abounds. When June arrives, they move toward higher altitudes, where the summer pastures have forests and meadows. The temperature here is cooler and food is abundant, providing an ideal environment for the livestock to gain weight.

When autumn arrives, the temperature drops very quickly and even brings snowfall in the high altitude. The herdsmen begin their massive migration from the end of September to the beginning of October to the lower valleys and plains, where they will stay until next spring.

Their transfer of livestock is not only a way to comply with the laws of nature, but also to avoid overgrazing. As every stage of the herd transfer is a ""great migration"" in itself, they must overcome many challenges from nature and diseases. To ensure the safety of both locals and livestock, police are dispatched to help the herdsmen by checking roads and weather, setting up camps and guiding the sheep and cows.

2109,18 of 20 gorillas at Atlanta's zoo have contracted COVID,"At least 18 of the 20 gorillas at Atlanta's zoo have now tested positive for COVID-19, an outbreak that began just days before the zoo had hoped to obtain a veterinary vaccine for the primates, officials said Tuesday.

Zoo Atlanta had announced the first positive tests among the western lowland gorillas on Friday after employees noticed the gorillas had been coughing, had runny noses and showed changes in appetite. A veterinary lab at the University of Georgia returned positive tests for the respiratory illness.

Zoo Atlanta says the National Veterinary Services Laboratories in Ames, Iowa, confirms that at least four of the samples from the gorillas so far have tested positive for the delta variant of the virus.

The zoo says it is using monoclonal antibodies to treat the gorillas at risk of developing complications from the virus.

Officials say there's no evidence that the gorillas can pass the virus back to humans and visitors are too far away to be infected by gorillas.

Because the gorillas live close together in four troops, zoo officials say it's impossible to keep infected animals isolated.

Zoo officials say they believe an asymptomatic employee who cares for the gorillas passed on the virus. The employee had been fully vaccinated and was wearing protective equipment such as a mask and gloves.

""According to our guidelines for animal care staff, if they have the slightest symptoms of a cold they are to stay home,"" said Dr. Sam Rivera, the zoo's senior director of animal health. ""It so happens that the animal care team member, the following day she developed signs that she suspected might be consistent with COVID and was tested and was positive.""

Senior Director of Animal Health at Zoo Atlanta Sam Rivera said the zoo will vaccinate the gorillas with a veterinary vaccine that it had been on the waiting list for prior to the gorillas' positive tests.

Eight gorillas at the San Diego Zoo Safari Park were treated for the virus in January. One San Diego silverback received an experimental antibody regimen, and all recovered.

Although powerful typhoons are nothing new in summer, such a strong one in autumn has caught many by surprise. Meteorological statistics show that in the past 72 years, summer was the most active season for typhoons, with 833 formed during that time, but autumn was a close second with 821 typhoons. And between 1949 and 2020, super typhoons accounted for 27.9 percent of typhoons generated in autumn, compared to 18 percent in summer.

Sea surface temperatures are usually the highest from August to September and this provides good conditions for the generation of typhoons. At the same time, from the end of August to the beginning of September, cold air becomes active, the pressure gradient increases and wind speeds near the center of the typhoon increases, which is also conducive to enhancing a typhoon's intensity. Therefore, in autumn, the probability of a strong typhoon or super typhoon is higher.

2111,Animal-based food generates nearly twice the emissions as plants,"Animal farming accounts for twice as many greenhouse gas emissions as plants grown for consumption, according to a study published Monday that mapped agricultural activities worldwide. From transportation and deforestation to cold storage and the digestive systems of cattle, what humans eat accounts for a major chunk of the emissions behind climate change.

Researchers looked at carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide released by food production and consumption from farming on land. And they found that from 2007 to 2013, the emissions amounted to 35 percent of all human-caused emissions, or 17.318 billion metric tonnes of CO2 equivalent greenhouse gases per year.

The study noted the growing demand for food worldwide and the industry's potential to exacerbate global warming. Plants grown for human consumption generated 29 percent of food emissions, the study published in Nature Food found, and the rest was attributed to other commodities like cotton and rubber. It did not include emissions from fisheries.

Plant-based diets are widely thought to be better for the planet. But lead researcher Atul Jain of the University of Illinois said he wanted to know exactly how much, admitting he had a personal reason for wanting to dig deeper into the issue.

""I've been a vegetarian since my childhood,"" he said. ""I wanted to estimate what my carbon footprint was.""

To come up with a consistent model for so many different products, Jain's team set to work from the ground up, breaking down the globe's farmland into some 60,000 grid squares.""Once we identify the crop area in a grid cell, we determine what percentage of the area is allocated to the crop, to the forest and to the grasses, and so on,"" he said.

Jain said his next research challenge was to include more granular data on consumption trends across the world to build a tool to allow people to calculate their own food-based carbon footprint.

""You can go to your location, identify what you eat, how much you eat and calculate your own carbon footprint,"" he said.

The estimate from the Washington-based development lender released Monday updates a 2018 report with new figures from Eastern Europe and Central Asia, North Africa and East Asia and the Pacific to provide a more complete overview of the potential toll from rising global temperatures. And the true toll could be far higher, as the data does not include countries such as those in Europe or North America, nor the Middle East and small island nations.

""Climate change is an increasingly potent driver of migration,"" the report said. Shortages of food and water along with rising seas highlight ""the urgency for action as livelihoods and human well-being are placed under increasing strain."" Juergen Voegele, the World Bank's vice president for sustainable development, said the data give a ""global estimate"" of the scale of potential migration.

Breaking the data down by region, internal migrants due to climate change could hit 86 million in sub-Saharan Africa by 2050, 49 million in East Asia and the Pacific, 40 million in South Asia, 19 million in North Africa, 17 million in Latin America and 5 million in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, according to the bank."

2119,Sustainability offers win-win solution for fishing industry in Fujian,"Fishing farms in a coastal city of east China's Fujian Province have upgraded their facilities to improve the quality of yellow croaker breeding and achieve sustainable development with financial support from the city.

The city of Ningde, located on the northeastern coast of Fujian, is home to one of China's most popular fish species -- the yellow croaker.

Decades of conservation and mariculture farming have helped revive the fish population, which was once nearly extinct due to overfishing. Fish farms in Ningde raise more than 7,000 tons of yellow croaker annually.

About three years ago, the local government began offering subsidies to upgrade the fishing farms, which helps to improve the quality of fish.

Turkey tail mushrooms have even more scientific names. If you come across names like Trametes versicolor, Coriolus versicolor and Polyporus versicolor, don't be confused, they all refer to the same mushroom. The Latin word ""versicolor"" means ""of several colors,"" which vividly depicts their wide range of color variations. Although shades of brown are the most commonly seen, you may find them with stunning bands of blue, red, orange or green.

Despite their colorful upper surface, the underside is white and covered in tiny shallow pores. They can be found throughout the year, but they are at their best in autumn and winter when they release spores. The mushrooms usually grow on dead trunks of deciduous trees like oak, beech, maple and birch. They are not only fodder for animals like squirrels, but also colorful shelters for insects.

The human species has suffered from malaria for thousands of years, but humankind has never surrendered to the disease. In 1820, French chemists Pelletier and Caventou isolated quinine, the active ingredient against malaria, from cinchona bark. However, traditional anti-malarial drugs are not as effective as they used to be because the parasite has developed resistance. In the 1970s, Chinese scientist Tu Youyou's team successfully extracted artemisinin from the Sweet sagebrush (Artemesia annua) plant, which won her the 2015 Nobel Prize in Physiology of Medicine. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends artemisinin-based combination therapy to treat uncomplicated malaria due to Plasmodium falciparum.

Artemisinin is extracted from the Sweet sagebrush plant, which is called ""Huanghuahao"" in Chinese. Because Artemisinin (""Qinghaosu"" in Chinese) and Celery Sagebrush (""Qinghao"" in Chinese) have similar Chinese names, it's often mistakenly believed to be extracted from Celery Sagebrush. At the most critical moment of research and development, Tu Youyou was inspired by ancient Chinese medicine literature. Tu Youyou and other scholars determined that the plant ""Qinghao"" recorded in ancient books refers to Sweet sagebrush rather than Celery Sagebrush through textual research of ancient medical literature, comparison of original plants, chemical composition, pharmacological action and curative effect, etc.

""Qinghao"" mainly treats tuberculosis, malaria, chills and fever, swollen and painful gums, diarrhea and so on, according to ""Compendium of Materia Medica."" According to ""Chinese pharmacopeia,"" ""Qinghao,"" which has a bitter taste and a cool nature, is the dry aboveground part of the Sweet sagebrush plant. It grows in wilderness, hillside, roadside and river banks. It is found in most parts of the country."

The overwhelming majority of fossil-fuel reserves must stay in the ground or the planet's climate crisis will accelerate, according to a new study by researchers at University College London.

Analysis suggests that even to stand a 50-50 chance of keeping global heating below 1.5 degrees Celsius – the growth-figure target enshrined in the Paris Agreement – countries and companies would need to leave 90 percent of coal reserves and 60 percent of oil and gas untouched.

To increase the chances of avoiding climate catastrophe, reductions would need to be even steeper, leaving trillions of dollars of mineral wealth untapped – with inevitable economic effects on companies and countries invested in fossil-fuel extraction.

Calling the future ""bleak"" and the situation ""absolutely desperate,"" the authors say the report ""implies that many operational and planned fossil fuel projects [are] unviable.""

Analyzing via geographical region, the report – published in Nature – says Europe would have to keep 90 percent of its coal, 72 percent of its oil and 43 of its gas in the ground. Other areas would face even more stringent restrictions.

Russia and the former Soviet states would be required to leave 97 percent of their coal reserves, as would the U.S., while Australia would forgo 95 percent. Oil-rich Canada would have to leave 83 percent of its black gold underground, along with 83 percent of its coal and 81 percent of its gas."

2129,The Great Herbs: From natural dye to herbal medicine,"Written by Li Shizhen (1518-1593), a famous Chinese doctor and pharmacist during the Ming Dynasty, ""Compendium of Materia Medica (Ben Cao Gang Mu)"" records a story about using herbs to treat spider bites. During the Tang Dynasty (618-907), Zhang Jian served as a subordinate to Zhang Yanshang. One day, Zhang Jian was bitten on the neck by a spider. After two nights, his head swelled as big as a bowl, and his stomach was also gradually getting bigger. Zhang Yanshang had always thought highly of Zhang Jian. Zhang Yanshang offered large sums of money to recruit doctors who could treat him. There was a person who claimed that he could cure Jian and he took a bowl of blue juice and sprinkled it on the spider bites. As expected, Jian healed in two days. In the bowl of blue juice was a herb called indigo naturalis.

As ""Chinese Pharmacopoeia"" explains, indigo naturalis which has a salty taste and a cool nature, is a dried powder or lump made from the leaves and stems of conehead (Strobilanthes cusia (Nees) Kuntze), knotweed indigo (Polygonum tinctorium Ait.) and indigo woad (Isatis indigotica Fortune). When autumn comes, people make the indigo naturalis by harvesting the stems and leaves of the above plants, soaking them in water until the leaves are rotten, peeling and removing the leaves, adding the right amount of lime milk, fully stirring the liquid to the immersion liquid, skimming the liquid surface foam and drying it in the sun.

Tanzania's environmental watchdog said on Thursday it has fined nine oil companies a total of 5.1 billion Tanzanian shillings (about 2.2 million U.S. dollars) over violation of environmental rules.

Samuel Gwamaka, the Director General of state-run National Environment Management Council (NEMC), said the nine companies have been fined after it was established that they constructed filling stations across the country without undergoing an environmental impact assessment (EIA).

""The nine oil companies should pay the fines within 14 days beginning Sept. 10,"" Gwamaka told a news conference in the commercial capital Dar es Salaam.

Gwamaka said an ongoing crackdown on oil companies that are operating filling stations without undergoing the EIA across the country has established that there are about 393 companies flouting the environmental rule.

He said NEMC has established that most of the oil companies have constructed filling stations without EIA, adding that the crackdown was continuous."
2132,"Over 1,000 Yangtze alligators to be born via artificial hatching","Over 1,000 artificially-incubated Chinese alligator eggs will be hatched before mid-September in Xuancheng City, east China's Anhui Province.

The population of wild Chinese alligators is very small. In recent years, the nature reserve has been releasing artificially-bred Chinese alligators into the wild to increase the species' wild population.

When an artificially-bred alligator lays eggs, staff members collect them in a hatching room. By automatically controlling the temperature and humidity, the eggs hatch in 55 days at a temperature of 31 degrees Celsius.

""Humidity control is mainly achieved through moisturizing the nest materials so that the alligator eggs can be hatched under high humidity conditions. The general humidity is close to 95 percent or more,"" said Zhou Yongkang, director of Scientific Research Office, Anhui Yangtze Alligator National Nature Reserve.

After nearly nine months of feeding, the baby Chinese alligators will be released into the wild from late May to early June next year.""

""Our current survival rate for baby alligators and for 1-year-old alligators can reach 95 percent, which is much higher than it was in the past,"" said Zhou.

2133,China rolls out pilot scheme for green power trading,"China rolled out a pilot scheme for green power trading on Tuesday, making strides towards the goals of peaking carbon emissions before 2030 and achieving carbon neutrality by 2060.

Enterprises can trade power with qualified photovoltaic and wind power generation companies. The cost is slightly higher than traditional sources at this stage because the green power also takes into account the environmental cost.



""The high price reflects the rights and interests of renewable energy power generation enterprises, further speeding up the development of renewable energy,"" said Tang Honghai, an employee of Beijing Power Exchange Center.



China General Nuclear Power Corporation (CGN) New Energy Holdings was one of the main green power producers in the Tuesday trading with more than 10 power plants in Jiangsu, Jilin and Anhui provinces participating.



""Over 1 billion kWh of our electricity was traded, generating over 35 million yuan in revenue for our new-energy producing companies,"" said Liu Jiapei, director of marketing center under the electricity marketing department of CGN New Energy Holdings.



Although the price is slightly higher for the electricity-consuming companies, it helps them accelerate green transformation and achieve low-carbon or even zero-emission development.



""The intention of green power trading reached nearly 20 billion kWh, which is about four times the trading scale of this time, indicating that the demand of our power users for green trading is very strong,"" said Tang.



Schneider Electric purchased over 17 million kWh of green power for its five factories in Shanghai, meeting 88 percent of their current round of demand, hoping to realize the relative ""zero emission"" in some factories in advance before 2022.



""We will do a lot of work, for example, the upgrading of green packaging, reducing carbon emission during transportation, photovoltaic power generation and wastewater reclamation. But these measures are not enough. To reach the goal of 100 percent relative zero emission, we must have green power,"" said Zhang Kaipeng, senior vice president of Schneider Electric.



The pilot scheme for green power trading uses blockchain technology. The whole trading process can be traced, tracked and certified, ensuring the traceability from production, trading and consumption, and improving the authority of green power consumption.



""We guide the consumption of green power in a market-oriented way, reflecting the environmental value of green electricity including wind power and photovoltaic power. The successful organization of the green power trading also marks a new step in the establishment of an electricity market system that adapts to the new power system,"" said Zhang Mianrong, chairman of the board of Guangzhou Power Exchange Center.
